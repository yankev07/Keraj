[{"id": 0, "name": "Affenpinscher", "country": "Germany, France", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog0", "description": "The Affenpinscher , also known as the Monkey Terrier, is a terrier-like toy Pinscher breed of dog.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe breed is German in origin and dates back to the seventeenth century. The name is derived from the German Affe (ape, monkey). The breed predates and is ancestral to the Griffon Bruxellois (Brussels Griffon) and Miniature Schnauzer.Dogs of the Affenpinscher type have been known since about 1600, but these were somewhat larger, about 12 to 13 inches, and came in colors of gray, fawn, black and tan and also red. White feet and chest were also common. The breed was created to be a ratter, working to remove rodents from kitchens, granaries, and stables.Banana Joe V Tani Kazari (AKA Joe), a five-year-old Affenpinscher, was named Best in Show at the 2013 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York City. This win is notable since it is the first time this breed has won Best in Show at Westminster.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nAn Affenpinscher generally weighs 6.5 to 13.2 pounds (2.9 to 6.0 kg) and stands 9 to 12 inches (23 to 30 cm) tall at the withers. It has a harsh rough coat when it is not clippered and if clippered it can be softer and fluffier. It has a notable monkey-like expression (Affe means monkey in German). Its coat is shaggier over the head and shoulders forming a mane, with a shorter coat over the back and hind quarters. It is harsh and wiry in texture when properly maintained. The FCI and KC breed standards specifies that the coat must be black, but the AKC also allows grey, silver, red, black and tan, and belge (a mixture of red, brown, black and white hairs); other clubs have their own lists of acceptable colors, with black being the preference.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nAffenpinschers have a distinct appearance that some associate with terriers. They are different from terriers, however, in that they are actually part of the \"Group 2, Section 1: Pinschers and Schnauzers\" in the FCI classification and so often get along with other dogs and pets. They are active, adventurous, curious, and stubborn, but they are also fun-loving and playful. The breed is confident, lively, affectionate towards family members and is also very protective of them. This loyal little dog enjoys being with its family. It needs consistent, firm training since some can be quite difficult to housebreak. This type of dog easily becomes bored, so training should be varied. The affenpinscher has a terrier-like personality.\nAffenpinschers are somewhat territorial when it comes to their toys and food, so they are not recommended for homes with very small children.  This dog is mostly quiet, but can become very excited if attacked or threatened, and shows no fear toward any aggressor.\n\n\n=== Lifespan ===\nA small sample (N=21) of affenpinschers in a UK survey had a median lifespan of 11.4 years, which is a typical lifespan for a purebred dog, but a bit lower than most breeds of their size. The most common causes of death were old age (24%), urologic (19%), and \"combinations\" (14%). \nThe affenpinscher is prone to hip dysplasia. As with many small breeds of dog, they are prone to collapsed trachea and luxating patella. Some are prone to fractures, PDA, open fontanel and respiratory problems in hot weather. Cataracts are occasionally reported. An emerging concern is syringomyelia, although the incidence is currently unknown.\n\n\n== Shedding ==\nAffenpinschers often appear on lists of dogs that allegedly do not shed (moult). Every hair in the dog coat grows from a hair follicle, which has a three phase cycle, as do most mammals. These cycles are: anagen, growth of normal hair; catagen, growth slows, and hair shaft thins; telegen, hair growth stops, follicle rests, and old hair falls off\u2014is shed. At the end of the telegen phase, the follicle begins the cycle again. The length of time of the growing and shedding cycle varies by breed, age, and by whether the dog is an inside or outside dog.\nFrequent grooming reduces the amount of loose fur in the environment.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCompanion Dog Group\nCompanion dog\nToy Group\nGriffon Bruxellois\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAffenpinscher at Curlie"}, {"id": 1, "name": "Afghan Hound", "country": "Afghanistan", "type": "Sighthound and Pariah", "picture": "dog1", "description": "The Afghan Hound is a hound that is distinguished by its thick, fine, silky coat and its tail with a ring curl at the end. The breed is selectively bred for its unique features in the cold mountains of Afghanistan. Its local name is T\u0101\u017e\u012b Spay (Pashto: \u062a\u0627\u0698\u064a \u0633\u067e\u06cc\u200e) or Sag-e T\u0101z\u012b (Dari Persian: \u0633\u06af \u062a\u0627\u0632\u06cc). Other names for this breed are Kuchi Hound, T\u0101z\u012b, Balkh Hound, Baluchi Hound, Barakzai Hound, Shalgar Hound, Kabul Hound, Galanday Hound or sometimes incorrectly African Hound.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Afghan Hound has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th Century. It is most closely related to the Saluki.Today's modern purebred Afghan Hound descends from dogs brought to Great Britain in the 1920s which King Amanullah of the Afghan Royal Family gave away as gifts. Some had been kept as hunting dogs, others as guardians.Although the breed is demonstrably ancient, verifiable written or visual records that tie today's Afghan Hound breed to specific Afghan owners or places are absent. There is much speculation about the breed's origin and possible connections with the ancient world among fanciers and in non-scientific breed books and breed websites. Connections with other types and breeds from the same area may provide clues to the history. A name for a desert coursing Afghan hound, Tazi (sag-e-tazi), suggests a shared ancestry with the very similar Tasy breed from the Caspian Sea area of Russia and Turkmenistan. Other types or breeds of similar appearance are the Taigan from the mountainous Tian Shan region on the Chinese border of Afghanistan, and the Barakzay, or Kurram Valley Hound.\nThere are at least 13 types known in Afghanistan, and some are being developed (through breeding and record keeping) into modern purebred breeds. As the lives of the peoples with whom these dogs developed change in the modern world, often these landrace types of dogs lose their use and disappear; there may have been many more types of longhaired sighthound in the past.\nOnce out of Afghanistan, the history of the Afghan Hound breed became entwined with that of the very earliest dog shows and the Kennel Club (UK). Various sighthounds were brought to England in the 1800s by army officers returning from British India (which at the time included), Afghanistan, and Persia, and were exhibited at dog shows, which were then just becoming popular, under various names, such as Barukzy hounds. They were also called \"Persian Greyhounds\" by the English, in reference to their own indigenous sighthound.\nOne dog in particular, Zardin, was brought in 1907 from India by Captain Bariff, and became the early ideal of breed type for what was still called the Persian Greyhound. Zardin was the basis of the writing of the first breed standard in 1912, but breeding of the dogs was stopped by World War I.Out of the longhaired sighthound types known in Afghanistan, two main strains make up the modern Afghan Hound breed. The first were a group of hounds brought to Scotland from Balochistan by Major and Mrs. G. Bell-Murray and Miss Jean C. Manson in 1920, and are called the Bell-Murray strain.\nThese dogs were of the lowland or steppe type, also called kalagh, and are less heavily coated. The second strain was a group of dogs from a kennel in Kabul owned by Mrs. Mary Amps, which she shipped to England in 1925. She and her husband came to Kabul after the Afghan war in 1919, and the foundation sire of her kennel (named Ghazni) in Kabul was a dog that closely resembled Zardin. Her Ghazni strain were the more heavily coated mountain type. Most of the Afghans in the United States were developed from the Ghazni strain from England. The first Afghans in Australia were imported from the United States in 1934, also of the Ghazni strain. The French breed club was formed in 1939 (FALAPA). The mountain and steppe strains became mixed into the modern Afghan Hound breed, and a new standard was written in 1948, which is still used today.\nThe afghan hound can also come with a much more \"patterned\" coat. This descends from the Bell-Murray's and the Ghazni lines, and is displayed in much lighter feathering of coat, deeper saddle (often actually looking like a saddle) and much shorter hair on the face and neck. It is believed that these particular afghan hounds were a product of much hotter parts of the country.The spectacular beauty of Afghan Hound dogs caused them to become highly desirable showdogs and pets, and they are recognised by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world. One of the Amps Ghazni, Sirdar, won BIS at Crufts in 1928 and 1930. An Afghan hound was featured on the cover of Life Magazine, November 26, 1945. \"Afghan Hounds were the most popular in Australia in the 1970s\u2026and won most of the major shows\". An Afghan Hound won BIS (Best in Show) at the 1996 World Dog Show in Budapest. Afghan hounds were BIS at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1957 and again in 1983. That win also marked the most recent win at Westminster for breeder-owner-handler, Chris Terrell.\nThe Afghan Hound breed is no longer used for hunting, although it can be seen in the sport of lure coursing.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Afghan Hound is tall, standing in height 61\u201374 cm (24\u201329 in) and weighing 20\u201327 kg (44\u201360 lb). The coat may be any colour, but white markings, particularly on the head, are discouraged; many individuals have a black facial mask. A specimen may have facial hair that looks like a Fu Manchu mustache. The mustache is called \"mandarins.\" Some Afghan Hounds are almost white, but parti-color hounds (white with islands of red or black) are penalized in the AKC standard, but not by the FCI. The long, fine-textured coat requires considerable care and grooming. The long topknot and the shorter-haired saddle on the back of the dog are distinctive features of the Afghan Hound coat. The high hipbones and unique small ring on the end of the tail are also characteristics of the breed.\nThe temperament of the typical Afghan Hound can be aloof and dignified, but happy and clownish when it's playing. This breed, as is the case with many sighthounds, has a high prey drive and may not get along with small animals. The Afghan Hound can be a successful competitor in dog agility trials as well as an intuitive therapy dog and companion.  Genomic studies have pointed to the Afghan Hound as one of the oldest of dog breeds.The breed has a reputation among some dog trainers of having a relatively slow \"obedience intelligence;\" Stanley Coren, in his book The Intelligence of Dogs, ranked the breed last among 138 breeds mentioned in ability to understand and obey commands, requiring more than 80 repetitions to understand a new command and obeying on the first command less than 25% of the time.\nAlthough seldom used today for hunting in Europe and America where they are popular, Afghan hounds are frequent participants in lure coursing events and are also popular in the sport of conformation showing.\n\n\n== Variants ==\n\nThe Khalag Tazi is a variety of the Afghan. It was introduced to Europe in 1920 when an Indian Army officer, Major G Bell-Murray, brought some animals back from Afghanistan. Tazi is a current and ancient name for hunting dogs of the sighthound type in the Middle East. It has been used to denote the Saluki, Afghan, Taigan, Persian Greyhound, greyhound types of hound.\n\n\n=== Bakhmull ===\n\nBakhmull (also Bakhmull Tazi or Tazi Bakhmull, also called Aboriginal Afghan Hound) is a long-haired variety of sighthound, also classified loosely as a mountain dog (breed originating in a high-altitude area). It has been bred mostly in Russia and claimed to represent an Afghan Hound aboriginal to Afghanistan. In Pashto the word bakhmull means 'velvet', applied in reference to the dog's silky coat, which is rather abundant and long on the whole body, except the \"saddle\" (middle to lower back), front parts of all four legs, and the muzzle. Its color is always fawn, ivory, or white, with a darker \"saddle\", thus it produces an impression of a (yellowish) dog whose coat color matches the khaki sandstone and limestone of the Hindu Kush mountain landscape and deserts. The following colors are not permissible: red, red with white spots, black, and black with white spots. Since the 1980s, the centre of Bakhmull breeding is Russia, beginning in Moscow, then spreading to various other places in the CIS.  The foundation stock was brought to Russia in the 1970s by military men returning from Afghanistan. Natalia Gherasiova (a breeder, of the Blue Dale el Bark Bakhmull kennel, and dog show judge) established the National Bakhmull Club, affiliated with the Russian Federation for Hunting Dogs (RFOS) and Russian Kynological Federation (RKF). A breed standard was first published in 1985, and a shared RFOS\u2013RKF revision was produced in 1997.The Bakhmull is expected to be graceful powerful, with a balanced and symmetrical appearance, and to exhibit predictable and comparatively intelligent behavior, including both calm and gregariousness around people (unless trained as a guard dog), and aggressive hunting in the field.  Although its coat is long, it does not require much grooming. Paws are well protected from injuries by \"feathering\" (thick additional paw fur).  Its long, velvety coat and its stamina makes more suitable than many breeds for harsh weather. The breed standard calls, rather subjectively, for \"aristocratic carriage and a beautiful head with gazelle-like ... eyes\".  The eyes should be large, brown, slanting upwards, and of almond shape, with rims outlined black.  Similar dark coloration is expected on the nose and lips, darker to match darker hair color (like fawn compared to white).  Height: 68\u201373 cm (27\u201328.5 in.), bitches 65\u201370 cm (25.5\u201327.5 in.).  The height at the withers is 3\u20134 cm higher than at the croup. A Bakhmull's gait should be easy and springy. Prescribed hunting behavior: Searching for prey, a Bakhmull walks or jog-trots. After seeing the game, it immediately starts galloping fast with a whole-body run (a full stretch, contracting to a ball, and back), covering long distances. and showing jumping power, speed, and manoeuvring skill.\n\n\n=== Closely related breeds ===\nThe Saluki is a breed of the Middle East with ancient origins (though its establishment as a standardised breed was primarily carried out in the United Kingdom and Germany), and is the most closely related to the Afghan Houndout of modern and internationally accepted breeds.  The Sloughi, with a name of the same derivation, is primarily of North African stock, and was originally considered the same breed as the Saluki.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n=== Lifespan ===\nAfghan Hounds in UK surveys had an average lifespan of about 12 years. which is similar to other breeds of their size. In the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (31%), old age (20%), cardiac (10.5%), and urologic (5%). Those that die of old age had a median lifespan of 12 years, with 12% living to at least 14.\n\n\n=== Health concerns ===\nMajor health issues are allergies, cancer, and hip dysplasia. Sensitivity to anesthesia is an issue the Afghan hound shares with the rest of the sighthound group, as sighthounds have relatively low levels of body fat. Afghan hounds are also among the dog breeds most likely to develop chylothorax, a rare condition which causes the thoracic ducts to leak, allowing large quantities of chyle fluid to enter the dog's chest cavity. This condition commonly results in a lung torsion (in which the dog's lung twists within the chest cavity, requiring emergency surgery), due to the breed's typically deep, \"barrel\"-shaped chest. If not corrected through surgery, chylothorax can ultimately cause fibrosing pleuritis, or a hardening of the organs, due to scar tissue forming around the organs to protect them from the chyle fluid. Chylothorax is not necessarily, but often, fatal.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nBecause of its distinctive appearance, the Afghan hound has been represented in animated feature films and TV shows, including Universal Pictures' Balto (Sylvie), Disney's Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure (Ruby) and Oliver & Company (Rita), an Afghan hound also appeared on 101 Dalmatians as well as in 102 Dalmatians as one of the dogs in Cruella De Vil's party and the television series What-a-Mess (Prince Amir of Kinjan; based on children's books by Frank Muir) and, as Prissy in the 1961 Disney animated film One Hundred and One Dalmatians and 101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure. Brainy Barker from Krypto the Superdog claims to be an Afghan Hound in the episode \"Meet the Dog Stars\", although her design actually resembles that of a Saluki instead of an Afghan Hound.\nAfghan hounds have also been featured in television advertisements and in fashion magazines. The Afghan hound is represented in books as well, including being featured in a series of mystery novels by Nina Wright (Abra), and a talking Afghan Hound in David Rothman's The Solomon Scandals (2008, Twilight Times Books). In the novel Between the Acts, Virginia Woolf uses an Afghan hound (named Sohrab) to represent aspects of one of the book's human characters.On August 3, 2005, Korean scientist Hwang Woo-Suk announced that his team of researchers had become the first team to successfully clone a dog, an Afghan Hound named Snuppy. In 2006 Hwang Woo-Suk was dismissed from his university position for fabricating data in his research. Snuppy, nonetheless, was a genuine clone, and thus the first cloned dog in history.The Afghan Hound features prominently in the avant-garde music video of popular French band M83's, \"Set in Stone (M83 Remix)\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAfghan Hounds (The World of Dogs) Race L., publisher Kingdom Books, PO Box 15, Waterlooville PO7 6BQ, 1999, England, 240 pages, ch 4, pages 81\u201383, contributed by Natalia Ghersiova, Russia.\nEncyclopedia \"Russian Hunting\".

It is a working dog following the nomads, protecting caravans and flocks of sheep, goats, camels and other livestock from wolves, big cats and thieves. It is sometimes known as just a local variant of the Central Asian Shepherd Dog and its status as a distinct breed is disputable.\nSage Kuchi or Sage Jangi is the standard Persian name, and the Pashto name is De Kochyano Spai or Jangi Spai, meaning \"Dog of the nomads\" and \"Fighter Dog\". It is found around the central and northern parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan and the surrounding regions in Central Asia.  This Mountain dog shares similar genetic background to the Central Asian Ovtcharka (CAO).\nBecause the dog is intricately associated with nomad life in remote and rugged regions where Western breeding techniques are not used, it is difficult to identify a \"true\" Kuchi type of dog.  Warfare and general unrest in the region has also affected the Kuchi people, of whom many have settled around cities creating ample opportunity for the Kuchi to interbreed with other dogs. There is no organizing body for dogs in Afghanistan and some Kuchi dogs have been exported to Europe.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Kuchi dog breed possesses a very rich gene pool, and the dogs adapt well to varying environments. It also means that gene expression can vary greatly from one individual to another.  For that reason, it is often difficult for an unaccustomed observer to determine what makes a particular dog a true Kuchi dog, or what type of a Kuchi dog it is.\nIn general, the Kuchi dog are large, often giant dogs, with a coat that can be short, medium, or long, backed by thick underwool.  They vary in height, reaching from 23 to 26 inches (58 to 66 cm) at the withers for the females, and from 24 to 29 inches (61 to 74 cm) and more for the males.\nTheir weight ranges from about 84 to 120 pounds (38 to 54 kg) for the female dogs, and from 88 to 176 pounds (40 to 80 kg) and more for the male dogs. It seems probable that the so-called \"dogs of Ghor\" should be included among these \"Kuchi dogs\":\n\n\"The dogs of Ghor are mentioned in the earliest descriptions of the province and were always regarded as particularly special mastiffs. According to the Seljuk chronicles of the eleventh century there was:'A remarkably fine breed of dogs in Ghor so powerful that in frame and strength every one of them is a match for a lion.' \nThe king of the Turquoise Mountain had two Ghor dogs, one named after him and one after the ruler of Ghazni. He would make them fight. It was dangerous to be around him on days when his namesake lost. These dogs formed part of the tribute from the Ghorids to the Seljuk and became such proverbial parts of Islamic culture that a medieval scholar is recorded as saying that 'Avicenna could not fight with a dog from Ghor'.\nTheir build is molosser-like with lighter and heavier variants, all of them exhibiting a perfect scissor-bite, and a majority of them free from most genetic defects like hip dysplasia.The shape of the head of a Kuchi dog can vary from a wedge-type head, to brick-type, or bear-type skull, the last one being associated mainly with the dogs of the mountain variety. Their tails are usually docked by about one-third of their length, and usually point straight up or at a slight angle. Traditionally, their ears are cropped, almost to the very base.\nThe Kuchi dogs are tall dogs, with a straight backline, which usually forms a square profile with the front and hind legs. The neck is usually long and thick, with plenty of excess skin hanging from the base of the jaw to the chest. The head is carried horizontally, or at a slight downward angle, with eyes staring straight ahead. The muzzle is dry and muscular.\nTheir body is often covered with dark spots which don't show through the coat. These spots can also cover the inside of the mouth, the bridge of the nose and the abdomen. The color of the coat comes in many varieties, and is of no importance to determining the breed or the type of Kuchi dog. Neither is the length or structure of the hair. Most often, a strip of longer, more wiry hair covers the entire length of the backline, while the neck area is packed with thick and slippery underwool, as well as hair that is slightly longer than over the rest of the body.\nThe tooth sizes range from small in some females, to very large in males, with the fangs often exceeding 1\u00bc\". The shape of the fangs can form a hook with a thicker base and the point directed toward the inside of the mouth, or can be straighter and tusk-like, much like a wolf's.\nThere are three main regional types recognized, belonging to one of two body types of dogs \u2013 the lion type and the tiger type. Those are determined depending on the build and the motor characteristics.\n\n\n== Sub-variants and types ==\nThe Kuchi dogs can roughly be divided into three types: the Mountain-type, the Steppe-type, and the Desert-type.\n\nThe mountain-type dogs form a very large-boned, heavy coated variety that is well suited to living in the mountainous regions of the Pamir range. They are usually found at higher elevations, where there is greater humidity and more extreme, cool temperatures.\nThe steppe-type dogs are of much lighter built, with medium to long hair. They are faster and more agile on expansive flats than the mountain variety. They can be characterized as having a mastiff-like built combined with a sighthound appearance.\nThe desert-type dogs represent a variant most often found in the large desert flatlands, with little vegetation and a hotter climate. They are of medium height, with a short to medium length coat backed by very thick underwool during the cold season. They can possess characteristics of both of the other types, especially when it comes to the head structure.Another way to classify the Kuchi dog could be according to a lion-type (Djence Sheri), or a tiger-type (Djence Palangi). This division applies mostly to the desert-type dogs, but it is important to keep in mind that each of the regional variants can display characteristics found in other types as well.\n\nThe lion-type dogs are of heavier built, with larger heads and deeper chests. Their coat is usually thicker, and they are of medium height with a larger, bear-type head.\nThe tiger-type dogs are the more athletic looking, with a long and deep habitus, brick or wedge shaped head, and shorter coat. They are more often linked with Steppe-type dogs.The difference between the two can also be seen in the way they move. The Lion-type dogs are more majestic in motion, they appear very proud thanks to keeping their heads raised while they walk.\nThe tiger type dogs exhibit more of a sidewinding, catlike motion, with the head usually at the level of the body, and front paws swinging inwards when walking, running, or jumping.\nBoth types are extremely agile and possess tremendous speed and tenacity when running or attacking.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThroughout history, the Kuchi people needed their dogs to be extremely vigilant in guarding their livestock and belongings. They trusted their dogs to safeguard their camps and caravans on their seasonal journeys. They also needed their dogs to be extremely tough, not only in the face of danger, but also for braving the rough environmental conditions that required incredible ability to adapt.\nThe Kuchis travelled from the mountains, through the deserts, in the freezing cold, and in the searing heat, through country that, for days, did not offer shelter, or food, or even water. They needed dogs that would survive in all kinds of extreme conditions, and still be able to perform their duties without hindering the progress of the caravan. They often had no spare time or energy left to feed and take care of their dogs. They could not afford to wait for them if they fell ill, or to keep checking to make sure they don\u2019t fall behind or run off.\nThe Kuchis needed dogs that would be fierce and possess unmatched stamina, courage and strength, but at the same time would be extremely intelligent, trustworthy and independent. They needed dogs that could function without any special guidance or training.\nThe resulting breed can be described as representing dogs of unwavering character, strong sense of pride, keen sense of ownership, social status, and territory, demonstrating outstanding tenacity and perseverance, and possessing unrivalled strength and agility, all of which enable them to defend everything that is a part of their turf and extended pack against all predators and intruders.\nThey can also be extremely friendly and affectionate, and tend to form deep emotional bonds with their 'pack members'. However, their independent minds also make them incompatible with Western lifestyle. They are prone to aggression towards most other dogs, and often humans, who encroach on their territory (this could include postal workers, utility company repairmen, emergency personnel, and even friends and family they have not been acquainted with before), and their territory could extend well beyond the regular house and backyard.\nThis breed is also very vocal in expressing their emotions. Kuchi dogs often growl to show either pleasure or displeasure, which can be misconstrued by many, especially children, as a sign of aggression - and lead to unwanted and potentially dangerous reactions on their part.\nThis does not mean that the Kuchi breed is entirely unmanagable. But it does mean that, in order to maintain safety and keep Kuchi dogs and their owners in good health and spirits, these dogs demand special attention from their owners, who should be experts on this particular breed, and on animal behaviour in general.\n\n\n== Breed history ==\nGeographical locale favoured the development of various types of the Kuchi dog. For example, in mountainous regions, the heavier coated and large boned dogs were preferred, while in a desert environment - a lighter, more agile build was more desirable. Natural selection occurred due to environmental conditions, as well as human preferences.\nOver the centuries, the breeds that \u2018settled\u2019 would become associated with that region, and some have even received names and international kennel breed status. The Kangal dog of Turkey, the Caucasian Ovtcharka in the Caucasus region, and many other breeds, such as the large shepherd breeds of Europe, all belong to this group of dogs.\nThe Central Asian Ovtcharka or \"CAO\" is a variant created by Russian breeders desiring to classify a highly varied group of dogs of Central Asia into a \u2018breed standard' which would allow the dogs to be graded when judged in competition at popular dog shows. This variant often appears as a large-bodied, heavier-headed, more uniform type; both in colour (often white), coat texture (shorter\u2014less variety) and body type. There is a significant divergence of type from the native Kuchi dogs to the show-winning Srednoaziatska Ovcharka.\nThe Kuchi dogs have not changed their basic phenotype over the same period of time; often appearing to be diverse in colour, head type, body mass and coat type. The Kuchi dogs need to work with their owners, fulfilling their duties. Otherwise they may act out their frustrations and lack of sense of purpose in ways that can be unacceptable to their owners and the rest of society. They are still a very primitive breed; the Kuchi dog has natural guarding instincts that are not for the show ring as purely working lines.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKuchi people\nAfghan Hound\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 3, "name": "Aidi", "country": "Morocco", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog3", "description": "The Aidi (from Tamazight \u2d30\u2d62\u2d37\u2d49, aydi, \"dog\") is a North African dog breed used as a livestock guardian, protecting herds of sheep and goats. It also possesses hunting capabilities and good scenting ability. In its native Morocco, it is often paired in hunting with the Sloughi, which chases down prey that the Aidi has located by scent.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Aidi (Berber dog in Morocco) is recognized as coming from North Africa (Morocco. The dog has never worked as a sheepdog even though the 1963 standard was published under the name Atlas Sheepdog; this was corrected in 1969. A courageous dog, the Aidi lived and worked in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco protecting his owner and property from wildcats, other predators, and strangers. This breed has also been called the Berber, after the Berber tribes who utilized it, and bears some resemblance to the Pariah dog who is believed to share its ancestry. As a protector of the desert nomad tribes, the most alert and aggressive dogs were staked around the perimeter of the camp at night. The Aidi has not been highly regarded by the tribes historically, as are most dogs other than the Sloughi and other breeds regarded as noble. However, Moroccans have recently formed a club to protect the purity of the breed which has contributed so much in so many roles, as protector, hunter, police dog, and pet. Although the Aidi has been used primarily as a working dog, he has become more common as a house dog in the country. This breed also makes a good urban pet if he is given tasks and exercise enough to keep him satisfied and happy.In color and flock guard work they share many characteristics of many mountain dog breeds.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nStanding 52\u201362 cm (20\u201324 in) in height and weighing around 55 pounds (25 kg), the Aidi's lean, muscular body is protected by a coarse, thick, weather-resistant coat with a heavy plumed tail. The coat is heavy and soft. The head is bear-like and in proportion to the rest of the body. The breed has a tapered muzzle with a black or brown nose that usually matches the coat. Their jaws are strong with tight black or brown lips. The medium-sized ears are tipped forward and drop slightly. The eyes are medium, with a dark color and dark rims. Coat colours are white, black, black and white, pale red, and tawny.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe Aidi is energetic and highly protective and is said to make an outstanding watchdog. It is a powerful dog that is also agile, alert, and ready for action. As it is a sensitive breed, the dog needs to be given appropriate training from a very young age. It needs to be exposed to as many social conditions as possible so that it makes an ideal family pet.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHancock, David (August 31, 2014).

It is traditionally called the \"King of Terriers\" because it is the largest of the terrier breeds.  The Airedale was bred from the Old English Black and Tan Terrier (now known as the Welsh Terrier), the Bull Terrier, the Otterhound and probably some other Terrier breeds, originally to serve as a versatile hunting and all around working farm dog.  In Britain this breed has also been used as a war dog, guide dog and  police dog.  In the United States, this breed has been used to hunt big game, upland birds, and water fowl, and serve in many other working capacities.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Airedale is the largest of the British terriers. They weigh 19\u201325 kilograms (42\u201355 lb) in fit condition and have a height at the withers of 58\u201361 centimetres (23\u201324 in) for males, with females slightly smaller. The American Kennel Club standard specifies a very slightly smaller dog. Larger Airedales, up to 55 kilograms (121 lb) can sometimes be found in North America.  They are sometimes referred to as \"Oorangs\" as this was the name of a kennel in Ohio in the early 1900s that produced this much larger variation, or Roosevelt Terriers.The Airedale has a medium-length black and tan coat with a harsh topcoat and a soft undercoat. They are an alert and energetic breed, \"not aggressive but fearless.\" It has been claimed that the larger \"Oorang\" type Airedales are more eager than the smaller, breed standard Airedales, but this is not necessarily so. The large type have been used for big game hunting and as family guardians or as pets, but usually do poorly in AKC (American Kennel Club) conformation shows. This larger type is also significantly more prone to hip dysplasia than the standard Airedales.\n\n\n==== Coat ====\nLike many terriers, the breed has a 'broken' coat, which is hard and wiry.  It is meant to be kept not so long as to appear ragged, and lies straight and close, covering body and legs. The outer coat is hard, wiry and stiff, the undercoat softer. The hardest coats are crinkly or just slightly waved. Curly soft coats are highly undesirable.\nThe coat is hypoallergenic, tending not to generate allergic reactions in people.\nAiredales bearing undercoats are generally groomed by hand stripping where a small serrated edged knife is used to pull out loose hair from the dog's coat.  Most Airedales require frequent (6 to 8 weeks) clipping or stripping as they do not shed.\nThe AKC breed standard states that the correct coat color is either a black saddle, with a tan head, ears and legs; or a dark grizzle saddle (black mixed with gray and white). Grizzle that is a mix of red hair in the black, often on the area of back before the tail are often the best and harshest coats.  There are, however, examples of non-standard black-coated and \"red\" (tan) coated Airedales, (the solid colored Airedales are NOT able to be AKC registered, since they are deviations from breed standard and have yet to be proven 'purebred' Airedale Terriers.) There are also the short coated \"Redline\" type Airedales, they appear to be genetic throwbacks in looks to the Airedale's early days when the breed's coats were much shorter than today's Airedale. Even with their shorter coat they still have the same hard wiry outer coat with a soft under coat and fall well within the criteria of the breed standard and therefore can be AKC registered and most are registered.\n\n\n==== Tail ====\n\nTraditionally the fluffy tail is long and erect. In most European countries and Australia it is illegal to dock dogs' tails unless it is for the dog's benefit (e.g., if the tail is broken). This has resulted in the emergence of a spitz tail in some dogs. Selective breeding should see this change over time and the required slightly curled tail set high on the back again become common.\nIn other parts of the world the Airedale's tail is commonly docked within five days of birth, but this is not considered a breed standard custom. To show an Airedale in the United States, the official AKC standard states \"The root of the tail should be set well up on the back. It should be carried gaily but not curled over the back. It should be of good strength and substance and of fair length.\"\n\n\n==== Size ====\nAiredales weigh approximately 50-80 pounds, being active and agile enough to perform well, while not too small to function as a physical deterrent, retriever or hunter. Some breeders have produced larger Airedale Terriers, such as the 'Oorang Airedale', developed in the 1920s.Ex-Army captain and Airdale breeder Walter Lingo's monthly magazine \"Oorang Comments\" (#25, page 81), stated that \"When full grown your Airedale dog will weigh from forty to fifty-five pounds and if a female will weigh slightly less. This is the standard weight, but when required, we can furnish oversized Airedales whose weight will be from sixty to one hundred pounds.\"\nBecause Lingo tried to fill orders for everyone, the Oorang strain size was never standardized. Airedales weighing from 40 to 100 pounds were produced, but for the most part they were approximately 50 pounds and 22 to 24 inches at the shoulder. In the United States, the male Airedales measure 40 to 70 pounds, with the Oorang strain typically in the 80 to 120 pound range.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Airedale can be used as a working dog and also as a hunting dog. Airedales exhibit some herding characteristics as well, and have a propensity to chase animals. They have no problem working with cattle and livestock. However, an Airedale that is not well trained will agitate and annoy the animals.  Airedales have generally long puppyhoods and tend to be more difficult to train in their youth.  \nThe Airedale Terrier, like most terriers, has been bred to hunt independently. As a result, the dog is very intelligent, independent, strong-minded, stoic, and can sometimes be stubborn. If children and Airedales are both trained correctly, Airedales can be an excellent choice for a family dog. Airedales can do well with cats and other small animals, especially when they are raised with them.  They are also very loyal to their owners. \nAlbert Payson Terhune wrote of the Airedale:\n\"Among the mine-pits of the Aire, the various groups of miners each sought to develop a dog which could outfight and outhunt and outthink the other miner's dogs. Tests of the first-named virtues were made in inter-mine dog fights. Bit by bit, thus, an active, strong, heroic, compactly graceful and clever dog was evolved \u2013 the earliest true form of the Airedale.\nHe is swift, formidable, graceful, big of brain, an ideal chum and guard. ....To his master he is an adoring pal. To marauders he is a destructive lightning bolt.\"\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nAiredale Terriers in UK, USA, and Canadian surveys had a median lifespan of about 11.5 years, which is similar to other breeds of their size.In a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (39.5%), old age (14%), urologic (9%), and cardiac (7%). In a 2000\u20132001 USA/Canada Health Survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (38%), urologic (17%), old age (12%), and cardiac (6%) A very hardy breed, although some may suffer from eye problems, hip dysplasia and skin infections.\nAiredales can be affected by hip dysplasia. \nLike most terriers, they have a propensity towards dermatitis. Skin disorders may go unnoticed in Airedales, because of their hard, dense, wiry coats. Itchy skin may be manifest as acral lick dermatitis (also known as lick granuloma; caused by licking one area excessively) or acute moist dermatitis or \"hot spots\" (an oppressively itchy, inflamed and oozing patch of skin, made worse by intense licking and chewing). Allergies, dietary imbalances, and under/over-productive thyroid glands are the main causes of skin conditions.\nAn Airedale's coat was originally designed to protect the dog from its predators\u2014the coat was designed to come out in the claws of the predator the dog was designed to hunt, leaving the dog unharmed. Because of this, some forms of skin dermatitis can respond to hand stripping the coat. Clipping the coat cuts the dead hair, leaving dead roots within the hair follicles. It is these dead roots which can cause skin irritations. However, hand stripping removes these dead roots from the skin and stimulates new growth.Gastric dilatation volvulus, also known as bloat, affects Airedale Terriers. The stomach can twist and block the esophagus, causing a buildup of gas and leading to cardiovascular collapse and death. Signs of bloat include gastric distress (stomach pain), futile attempts at vomiting, and increased salivation. Bloat usually occurs when the dog is exercised too soon after eating. They will eat up to 4-6 cups of food at a time.\nDue to the breed's stoic nature, injuries can go unnoticed for a time as the dog will not give obvious signs of pain or distress like whining. For example, the first indication of a cut on the foot might be limping or favoring that foot a few days after the actual injury, so owners should be aware of their pets usual movement to spot irregularities. Excessive licking of a spot may also indicate a problem other than the skin conditions listed above.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAiredale, a valley (dale) in the West Riding of Yorkshire, named for the River Aire that runs through it, was the birthplace of the breed. In the mid-19th century, working-class people created the Airedale Terrier by crossing the old English rough-coated Black and Tan Terrier with the Otterhound and an assortment of other breeds. In 1886, the Kennel Club of England formally recognized the Airedale Terrier breed.\nIn 1864 they were exhibited for the first time at a championship dog show sponsored by the Airedale Agricultural Society. They were classified under different names, including Rough Coated, Bingley and Waterside Terrier. In 1879 breed fanciers decided to call the breed the Airedale Terrier, a name accepted by the Kennel Club (England) in 1886.\nWell-to-do hunters of the era were typically accompanied by a pack of hounds and several terriers, often running them both together. The hounds would scent and pursue the quarry and the terriers would \"go to ground\" or enter into the quarry's burrow and make the kill. Terriers were often the sporting dog of choice for the common man. Early sporting terriers needed to be big enough to tackle the quarry, but not so big as to prevent them from maneuvering through the quarry's underground lair. As a result, these terriers had to have a very high degree of courage and pluck to face the foe in a tight, dark underground den without the help of human handlers.\n\nDuring the middle of the 19th century, regular sporting events took place along the River Aire in which terriers pursued the large river rats that inhabited the area. A terrier was judged on its ability to locate a \"live\" hole in the riverbank and then, after the rat was driven from its hole by a ferret brought along for that purpose, the terrier would pursue the rat through water until it could make a kill. As these events became more popular, demand arose for a terrier that could excel in this activity. One such terrier was developed through judicious crossings of the Black-and-Tan Terrier and Bull and Terrier dogs popular at the time with the Otter Hound. The result was a long-legged fellow that would soon develop into the dog we recognize today as the Airedale Terrier. This character was too big to \"go to ground\" in the manner of the smaller working terriers; however, it was good at everything else expected of a sporting terrier, and it was particularly adept at water work. This big terrier had other talents in addition to its skill as a ratter. Because of its hound heritage it was well equipped to pick up the scent of game and due to its size, able to tackle larger animals. It became more of a multipurpose terrier that could pursue game by powerful scenting ability, be broken to gun, and taught to retrieve. Its size and temperament made it an able guardian of farm and home. One of the colorful, but less-than legal, uses of the early Airedale Terrier was to assist its master in poaching game on the large estates that were off-limits to commoners. Rabbits, hare, and fowl were plentiful, and the Airedale could be taught to retrieve game killed by its master, or to pursue, kill, and bring it back itself.\nThe first imports of Airedale Terriers to North America were in the 1880s. The first Airedale to come to American shores was named Bruce. After his 1881 arrival, Bruce won the terrier class in a New York dog show.\n\nThe patriarch of the breed is considered to be CH Master Briar (1897\u20131906). Two of his sons, Crompton Marvel and Monarch, also made important contributions to the breed.The first Canadian registrations are recorded in the Stud book of 1888\u20131889.\nIn 1910, the ATCA (Airedale Terrier Club of America) offered the Airedale Bowl as a perpetual trophy, which continues to this day. It is now mounted on a hardwood pedestal base, holding engraved plates with the names of the hundreds of dogs that have been awarded Best of Breed at the National Specialties.\nThe Airedale was extensively used in World War I to carry messages to soldiers behind enemy lines and transport mail. They were also used by the Red Cross to find wounded soldiers on the battlefield. There are numerous tales of Airedales delivering their messages despite terrible injury. An Airedale named \"Jack\" ran through half a mile of enemy fire, with a message attached within his collar. He arrived at headquarters with his jaw broken and one leg badly splintered, and right after he delivered the message, he dropped dead in front of its recipient.Lieutenant Colonel Edwin Hautenville Richardson was responsible for the development of messenger and guard dogs in the British Army. He, along with his wife, established the British War Dog School at Shoeburyness in Essex, England. In 1916, they provided two Airedales (Wolf & Prince) for use as message carriers. After both dogs proved themselves in battle, Airedales were given more duties, such as locating injured soldiers on the battlefield, an idea taken from the Red Cross.\nBefore the adoption of the German Shepherd as the dog of choice for law enforcement and search and rescue work, the Airedale terrier often filled this role.\nIn 1906, Richardson tried to interest the British Police in using dogs to accompany officers, for protection on patrol at night. Mr. Geddes, Chief Goods Manager for Hull Docks in Yorkshire, was convinced after he went and saw the impressive work of police dogs in Belgium. Geddes convinced Superintendent Dobie of the North Eastern Railway Police, to arrange a plan for policing the docks. Airedale Terriers were selected for duty as police dogs because of their intelligence, good scenting abilities and their hard, wiry coats that were easy to maintain and clean.  They were trained in Hull to attack people not in uniform which could cause problems for their handlers when off duty.  The first four dogs began patrols in Hull Docks in 1908, and the scheme was later extended to other docks policed by the North Eastern Railway Police.At the beginning of the Russo-Japanese war in 1904, the Russian embassy in London contacted Lt. Colonel Richardson for help acquiring dogs for the Russian Army, trained to take the wounded away from the battlefields. He sent terriers, mostly Airedale Terriers, for communication and sanitary services. Although these original imports perished, Airedale Terriers were reintroduced to Russia in the early 1920s for use by the Red Army. Special service dog units were created in 1923, and Airedale Terriers were used as demolition dogs, guard dogs, police tracking dogs and casualty dogs. \nTwo Airedales were among the dogs lost with the sinking of the RMS Titanic.  The Airedale \"Kitty\" belonged to Colonel John Jacob Astor IV, the real-estate mogul.  The second Airedale belonged to William E. Carter of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Mr. Carter was the owner of the Renault automobile in which Jack and Rose trysted in the movie Titanic. Carter, his wife and two children survived the sinking.\nDuring the 1930s, when airedales were farmed like livestock, a few American breeders developed the Oorang Airedale offshoot.\nCapt. Walter Lingo, of LaRue, Ohio, developed the Oorang Airedale strain. The name came from a line of bench champions, headed by King Oorang 11, a dog which was said to have been the finest utility dog. King could retrieve waterfowl and upland game, tree raccoons, drive cattle and sheep, and bay mountain lions, bears, and wolves. King even fought one of the best fighting bull terriers, and killed his opponent. He also trained in Red Cross work, and served the American Expeditionary Force at the front in France.\nLingo simply wasn't satisfied with the average strain of Airedale, and after an incredible series of breedings, for which he brought in great Airedales from all over the world, he created the \"King Oorang.\" At the time, Field and Stream magazine called it, \"the greatest utility dog in the history of the world.\" The Oorang Kennel Company continued until Walter Lingo's death in 1969. To help promote the King Oorang, as well as his kennels, Lingo created the Oorang Indians football team headed up by Jim Thorpe. The team played in National Football League from 1922\u20131923. Jerry Siebert, an Airedale breeder in Buckeye Lake, Ohio, followed in Lingo's footsteps, and bred \"Jerang Airedales.\" There is a kennel in Tennessee that claims to have original Oorang Airedales.\n\nAfter the First World War, the Airedales' popularity rapidly increased thanks to stories of their bravery on the battlefield and also because Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, and Warren Harding owned Airedales. President Harding's Airedale, Laddie Boy, was the \"first celebrity White House pet\". \nPresident Harding had a special chair hand carved for him to sit on at very important Cabinet meetings. In the 1920s, the Airedale became the most popular breed in the USA.\nPresident Roosevelt claimed that \"An Airedale can do anything any other dog can do and then lick the other dog, if he has to.\"\n1949 marked the peak of the Airedales' popularity in the USA, ranked 20th out of 110 breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club.\nThe Airedale Terrier was recognized by United Kennel Club in 1914.The Airedale Terrier was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1888.The Airedale Terrier Club of America (ATCA), founded in 1900 is the parent club of the breed in the United States and the official-spokes organization  for the breed with the American Kennel Club (AKC).The Airedale Terrier Club of America periodically holds performance and conformation events. The Airedale judged to be Best of Breed at these national specialty shows is awarded the Airedale Bowl.\n\n\n== Notable Airedales ==\n\nKitty, owned by John Jacob Astor IV, perished during the sinking of the Titanic.\nLaddie Boy\nPaddy the Wanderer\nThe dog Myrtle Wilson buys in The Great Gatsby is said to be an Airedale, but Nick Carraway notices it has white paws.\nMuggs, \"The Dog That Bit People\" owned by James Thurber as described in My Life and Hard Times.\nDuke, owned by American actor John Wayne (from which Wayne got his nickname).\nRufus, from Open Season 2\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCummins, Bryan (June 2001).

It is officially recognized by the KIF, a.k.a. the Turkish Kennel Club. This dog is one of the national dog breeds of Turkey.\n\n\n== History ==\nThis breed was introduced to North America in the 1970s by Americans Judith and David Nelson  who had been conducting research on white coloured dogs in the historical Armenian highlands.\nArcheological evidence suggests that the earliest civilizations arose in this region of the world where plants were first cultivated and the first livestock were domesticated. In short order there would have been a need for livestock protection dogs to care for the livestock.\nOther white breeds of livestock protection dogs from around the world include, but may not be limited to: \n\nAidi or Chien De L'Atlas, originally from North Africa (preferred color white, but other colors appear)\nGreat Pyrenees, of the Pyrenees Mountain areas in France and Spain (may have coloured patches, especially around the head)\nGreek Sheepdog, from Greece\nKomondor from Hungary\nKuvasz from Hungary (white or ivory)\nMaremma-Abruzzese Sheepdog, from the Maremma plains and from the Abruzzi mountainous region of Italy (may have light yellow/orange on ears)\nPolish Tatra Sheepdog or Owczarek Podhalanski, from Poland\nCiob\u0103nesc Rom\u00e2nesc de Bucovina, also known as Southeastern European Shepherd Dog in the FCI,  from Romania\nSlovak Cuvac or Slovensky Tchouvatch, from Slovakia\nSouth Russian Ovtcharka or South Russian Sheepdog\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Akbash is a large dog, weighing from 75 to 140 pounds (34 to 64 kg), averaging 90 pounds for the female, and 120 pounds for the male. Akbash dogs range from about 27 to 32 inches (69 to 81 cm) tall. The Akbash tends to be leaner than other Turkish livestock guardian dog breeds (Kangal and Anatolian Shepherd), and some Akbash dogs may also be taller.\nThe Akbash has a smooth-short to medium-full white double coat (sometimes with light biscuit coloring at the ears). The dogs have long legs, a tail that curls and is frequently feathered, and pink skin blotched with black or blackish-brown under the white coat. Eye rims, nose and lips should be completely black or blackish-brown, but they may also be lighter, especially during cold winter months.\nAkbash dog genetics may derive from a combination of molosser and sighthound breeds since they possess characteristics of both types. Although there is a great deal of variation in size and height of individuals, Akbash Dogs have a reputation for being tall with long, strong, flexible bodies. They have loose skin around their necks to help protect them from predators during fights. Heads can range from medium to heavy, though medium is preferred. Purebred Akbash Dogs may or may not be born with rear double dewclaws. Lack of, or possession of rear double dewclaws in an Akbash is no indication of recent interbreeding with other livestock guardian breeds nor any other breeds.\nSome people suggest that the Akbash and the Kangal Dog were originally distinct, pure Turkish breeds, and that they were combined to create the Anatolian Shepherd Dog. There still exists controversy on this subject. Akbash Dogs should be easy to recognize next to Kangals and Anatolian Shepherds because of their white appearance, although some Anatolian Shepherds may resemble the Akbash or the Kangal.\nCurrently, it is legal to export Akbash Dogs from Turkey but not Kangal Dogs. Kangals are considered the national dog breed of Turkey.\nThe Akbash Dog is not recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) but is recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) and by the FCI as of 2015. Akbash Dogs may be shown in American Rare Breed Association (ARBA) shows, and in International All Breed Canine Association (IABCA) shows.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe Akbash personality tends to be calm and aware. As a breed, it is not shy, nor is it aggressive. When used as a protection dog, it is suspicious of strangers in its territory, and any unusual sounds or changes in the environment. The breed is not naturally hostile, and is instead, naturally discerning, bred to think independently. The Akbash can be powerful against predators, yet, when properly exposed, be gentle with newborn lambs and goat kids. The usual first means of protection by an Akbash is to warn potential threats by posturing, barking and/or growling. The Akbash will chase away a predator, or engage in physical combat if necessary.\nAlthough the Akbash is frequently mistakenly referred to as being a herding dog, they do not chase and round up livestock. Akbash Dogs should never chase livestock although occasionally they may move their charges away from danger. The Akbash Dog is one of the more popular of about 30 breeds worldwide of Flock Guardians, Livestock Protection Dogs, or Livestock Guardian Dogs (LGDs).\nIn their role as livestock guardian dogs, Akbash Dogs frequently spend long hours lying with flocks or herds. The Akbash is a relatively low energy breed, although they are said to always be thinking and taking in what is happening around them (and that they \"sleep with one eye open\"). They regularly patrol the perimeters of their territories; listening, scenting and seeing beyond any fence lines. Like their sighthound ancestors, the vision of Akbash Dogs is excellent. They reserve much of their physical energy for possible encounters with predators.\nWhen protecting their charges they have tremendous power, focus, endurance and perseverance. Their great speed, loose neck skin, flexible bodies and bounding athleticism give them the physical edge they need to excel as livestock protection dogs. Most predators will not openly confront a working Akbash Dog. To avoid injuries to livestock protection dogs, and to better protect flocks and herds, more than one dog should be used in many working situations. Predators are less likely to challenge several protection dogs than a single dog. This is especially important when wolf packs, grizzlies and cougars are the prevalent threats.\nThe Akbash is uncommon as a companion dog. When trained appropriately from puppyhood on, they will get along with other domestic species. Since the Akbash has been bred to think on its own, dogs of this breed can be a challenge to train for obedience exercises. They have been bred not to chase their charges, so they tend not to be as interested in chasing balls or in games of fetch. They prefer large areas and may become discontent and exhibit problem behaviors, like escaping or being destructive, if relegated to a pen or small yard. Akbash Dogs require tall secure fencing for best containment. The Akbash is not a dog for everyone. It is a working breed and is happiest when given a job compatible to its breeding, or at the least, when kept mentally engaged.  These dogs are known for their intelligence, bravery, independence and loyalty.\n\n\n== Health ==\nAkbash Dogs, like many large breeds, can be expected to live 10 to 11 years on average, with some living much longer. Akbash Dogs are capable of bonding very closely with their owners and other animals and can display a range of emotions and sensitivity unlike many other breeds. Like other breeds, they are susceptible to various infectious diseases and conditions to varying degrees.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnatolian Shepherd\nHerding dog\nKangal Dog\nLivestock guardian dog\nMountain dog\nTibetan mastiff\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nThe Mini-Atlas of Dog Breeds by Andrew DePrisco and James B.

There are two separate varieties of Akita: a Japanese strain, commonly called \"Akita Inu\" (\"inu\" means \"dog\" in Japanese), or \"Japanese Akita\"; and an American strain, known as the \"Akita\" or \"American Akita\".  The Japanese strain comes in a narrow palette of colors, with all other colors considered atypical of the breed, while the American strain comes in all dog colors. The Akita has a short double-coat similar to that of many other northern spitz breeds such as the Siberian Husky, but long-coated dogs can be found in many litters due to a recessive gene.\nThe Akita is a powerful, independent and dominant breed, commonly aloof with strangers but affectionate with family members. As a breed, Akitas are generally hardy, but they have been known to be susceptible to various genetic conditions and can be sensitive to certain drugs.\nIn all countries except the United States, the Japanese and American strains of Akita are considered two separate breeds. In the United States, however, the two strains are considered a single breed with differences in type. For a while, the American strain of Akita was known in some countries as the \"Great Japanese Dog\". Both forms of Akita are probably best known worldwide from the true story of Hachik\u014d, a loyal Akita who lived in Japan before World War II.\n\n\n== Breed name ==\n \nThere is debate among fanciers whether there are two separate breeds of Akita. To date, only the American Kennel Club, consider American and Japanese Akitas to be two varieties of the same breed, allowing free breeding between the two. The United Kennel Club, The Federation Cynologique Internationale, The Kennel Club, the Australian National Kennel Council, the New Zealand Kennel Club, and the Japan Kennel Club consider Japanese and American Akitas as separate breeds. Some countries refer to the American Akita as simply the \"Akita\" and not the American Akita. The issue is especially controversial in Japan. For the FCI's 84 countries, the breed split formally occurred June 1999, when the FCI decided that the American type would be called the Great Japanese Dog, later renamed the American Akita in January 2006.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Japanese history ===\n\nJapanese history, both verbal and written, describe the ancestors of the Akita, the Matagi dog \uff08Japanese:\u30de\u30bf\u30ae\u72ac\uff09(hunting dog, Bear hunting dog, Deer hunting dog), as one of the oldest of the native dogs. Today's Akita developed primarily from dogs in the northernmost region of the island of Honsh\u016b in the Akita prefecture, thus providing the breed's name. The Matagi's quarry included wild boar, Sika deer, and Asian black bear. This precursor dog tracked large game, holding it at bay until hunters arrived to make the kill. The breed is also influenced by crosses with larger breeds from Asia and Europe, including English Mastiffs, Great Danes, St. Bernards, and the Tosa Inu, in the desire to develop a fighting dog for the burgeoning dog fighting industry in Odate in the early 20th century. During World War II the Akita was also crossed with German Shepherds in an attempt to save them from the wartime government order for all non-military dogs to be culled. The ancestors of the American Akita were originally a variety of the Japanese Akita, a form that was not desired in Japan due to the markings, and which is not eligible for show competition.\n\nThe story of Hachik\u014d, the most revered Akita of all time, helped push the Akita into the international dog world. Hachik\u014d was born in 1923 and owned by Professor Hidesabur\u014d Ueno of Tokyo. Professor Ueno lived near the Shibuya Train Station in a suburb of the city and commuted to work every day on the train. Hachik\u014d accompanied his master to and from the station each day. On May 25, 1925, when the dog was 18 months old, he waited for his master's arrival on the four o'clock train, but Professor Ueno had a fatal brain haemorrhage  at work. Hachik\u014d continued to wait for his master's return. He travelled to and from the station each day for the next nine years. He allowed the professor's relatives to care for him, but he never gave up the vigil at the station for his master. His vigil became world-renowned when, in 1934, shortly before his death, a bronze statue was erected at the Shibuya train station in his honor. This statue was melted down for munitions during the war, but a new one was commissioned after the war. Each year on April 8 since 1936, Hachik\u014d's devotion has been honoured with a solemn ceremony of remembrance at Tokyo's Shibuya railroad station.  Eventually, Hachik\u014d's legendary faithfulness became a national symbol of loyalty, particularly to the person and institution of the Emperor.In 1931, the Akita was officially declared a Japanese Natural Monument. The Mayor of Odate City in Akita Prefecture organized the Akita Inu Hozonkai to preserve the original Akita as a Japanese natural treasure through careful breeding. In 1934 the first Japanese breed standard for the Akita Inu was listed, following the breed's declaration as a natural monument of Japan.  In 1967, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Akita Dog Preservation Society, the Akita Dog Museum was built to house information, documents and photos. There is a tradition in Japan, that when a child is born they receive a statue of an Akita. This statue symbolizes health, happiness, and a long life.\n\nIn 1937, Helen Keller travelled to Japan. She expressed a keen interest in the breed and was presented with the first two Akitas to enter the US. The first dog, presented to her by Mr. Ogasawara and named Kamikaze-go, died at 7 1/2 months of age from distemper, one month after her return to the States. A second Akita was arranged to be sent to Miss Keller: Kamikaze's litter brother, Kenzan-go.  Kenzan-go died in the mid-1940s.  By 1939 a breed standard had been established and dog shows had been held, but such activities stopped after World War II began. Keller wrote in the Akita Journal:\n\nJust as the breed was stabilizing in its native land, World War II pushed the Akita to the brink of extinction. Early in the war the dogs had a lack of nutritious food. Then many were killed to be eaten by the starving populace, and their pelts were used as clothing. Finally, the government ordered all remaining dogs to be killed on sight to prevent the spread of disease. The only way concerned owners could save their beloved Akitas was to turn them loose in remote mountain areas, where they bred back with their ancestor dogs, the Matagi, or conceal them from authorities by means of crossing with German Shepherds, and naming them in the style of German Shepherds of the time.  Morie Sawataishi and his efforts to breed the Akita is a major reason this breed exists today.During the occupation years following the war, the breed began to thrive again through the efforts of Sawataishi and others.  For the first time, Akitas were bred for a standardized appearance. Akita fanciers in Japan began gathering and exhibiting the remaining Akitas and producing litters in order to restore the breed to sustainable numbers and to accentuate the original characteristics of the breed muddied by crosses to other breeds.  U.S. servicemen fell in love with the Akita and imported many with them upon their return.\n\n\n=== American history ===\n\nThe Japanese Akita and American Akita began to diverge in type during the Post\u2013World War II era, even though, earlier in Japan they already distinguished between a pure bred Akita and not. For example Hachiko was a pure bred Akita. Helen Keller is credited with bringing the Akita to America after being gifted two Akitas by the Japanese government in 1938.  A breed standard by 1939 and dog shows began to be held but then World War 2 began.  It was during this time, that US servicemen serving as part of the occupation force in Japan first came into contact with the Akita, the breed so impressed them that many servicemembers chose to bring an Akita back home with them upon completion of their tour. American servicemembers were typically more impressed with the larger more bear-like fighting Akita or German Shepherd type than they were with the smaller framed and fox-like Akita-Inu; the types of dogs they brought back with them to the US reflected this sentiment. Japanese Akita fanciers focused on restoring the breed as a work of Japanese art or to 'Natural Monument' status. American Akita fanciers chose to breed larger, heavier-boned and more intimidating dogs. Although, both types derive from a common ancestry, there are marked differences between the two. First, while American Akitas are acceptable in all colors, Japanese Akitas are only permitted to be red, white, or brindle. Additionally, American Akitas may be pinto and/or have black masks, unlike Japanese Akitas where it is considered a disqualification and not permitted in the breed standards. American Akitas generally are heavier boned and larger, with a more bear-like head, whereas Japanese Akitas tend to be lighter and more finely featured with a fox-like head.Recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1955, it was placed in the Miscellaneous class. It was not until the end of 1972 that the AKC approved the Akita standard and it was moved to the Working dog class, as such, the Akita is a rather new breed in the United States. Foundation stock in America continued to be imported from Japan until 1974 when the AKC cut off registration to any further Japanese imports until 1992 when it recognized the Japan Kennel Club. The decision by the AKC to disallow the registration of any further imported dogs in 1974, set the stage for the divergence in type between the American Akita and Japanese Akita Inu that is present today.Elsewhere in the world, the American Akita was first introduced to the UK in 1937, he was a Canadian import, owned by a Mrs. Jenson, the descendants of Mrs. Jenson live on today breeding American Akitas, the most widely known of them is Mr. Joseph Felton, a widely known & award winning Akita breeder, however the breed was not widely known until the early 1980s. The breed was introduced in Australia in 1982 with an American Import and to New Zealand in 1986 with an import from the U.K.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nAs a spitz breed, the appearance of the Akita reflects cold weather adaptations essential to their original function. The Akita is a substantial breed for its height with heavy bones. Characteristic physical traits of the breed include a large, bear-like head with erect, triangular ears set at a slight angle following the arch of the neck. Additionally, the eyes of the Akita are small, dark, deeply set and triangular in shape. Akitas have thick double coats, and tight, well knuckled cat-like feet. Their tails are carried over the top of the back in a gentle or double curl down the loin.Mature American type males measure typically 26\u201328 inches (66\u201371 cm) at the withers and weigh between 100\u2013130 lb (45\u201359 kg). Mature females typically measure 24\u201326 inches (61\u201366 cm) and weigh between 70\u2013100 lb (32\u201345 kg). The Japanese type, as stated in the breed standards, are a little smaller and lighter.Breed standards state that all dog breed coat colors are allowable in the American Akita, including pinto, all types of brindle, solid white, black mask, white mask, self-colored mask, even differing colors of under coat and overlay (guard hairs). This includes the common Shiba Inu coloring pattern known as Urajiro. The Japanese Akitas, as per the breed standards, are restricted to red, fawn, sesame, brindle, pure white, all with \"Urajiro\" markings i.e., whitish coat on the sides of the muzzle, on the cheeks, on the underside of jaw, neck, chest, body and tail and on the inside of the legs.\n\n\n=== Coat types ===\n\nThere are two coat types in the Akita, the standard coat length and the long coat. The long coat is considered a fault in the show ring, however. The long coat, also known as 'Moku' is the result of an autosomal recessive gene and may only occur phenotypically if both sire and dam are carriers. They have longer (about 3\u20134 inches in length) and softer coats and are known to have sweeter temperaments. It is believed that this gene comes from the now extinct Karafuto-Ken \u6a3a\u592a\u72ac. Unlike their short coat cousins, the long coats are less highly prized and thus more affordable.\n\n\n=== Grooming needs ===\nAmerican Akitas are a low maintenance dog breed. Grooming them should be an easy process.  They are fairly heavy shedders and can go heavier than normal two to three times per year.  Daily brushing could be a good way to reduce this problem.  This breed needs to bathe every few months, although it can be more often, depending on the needs of each owner.  Toenails should be trimmed every month, and their ears should be cleaned once a week.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Akita is generally seen as territorial about its property, and can be reserved with strangers. It is sometimes described as feline in its actions; it is not unusual for an Akita to clean its face after eating, to preen its kennel mate, and to be fastidious in the house.  They are known to be intolerant of other dogs of the same sex, as stated in the AKC breed standard.Since it is a large, powerful dog, the Akita is not considered a breed for a first time dog owner. The breed has been targeted by some countries' breed-specific legislation as a dangerous dog.  The Akita is a large, strong, independent and dominant dog. A well-trained Akita should be accepting of non-threatening strangers, otherwise they will treat all strangers in an aggressive manner. As a breed they should be good with children; it is said that the breed has an affinity for children. Not all Akitas will necessarily have the same temperament.Akitas tend to take a socially dominant role with other dogs, and thus caution must be used in situations when Akitas are likely to be around other dogs, especially unfamiliar ones. In particular, Akitas tend to be less tolerant of dogs of the same sex. For this reason, Akitas, unless highly socialized, are not generally well-suited for off-leash dog parks. Sometimes spontaneous, it needs a confident, consistent handler, without which the dog will be very wilful and may become very aggressive to other dogs and animals.\n\n\n== Training ==\nThe Akita Inu is one of the most dominant dog breeds. Therefore, training should start in an early age of 7 \u2013 8 weeks.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n=== Autoimmune diseases ===\nThere are many autoimmune diseases that are known to sometimes occur in the Akita. These include, but are not limited to:\n\nVogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, also known as Uveo-Dermatologic Syndrome is an auto-immune condition which affects the skin and eyes.\nAutoimmune hemolytic anemia, which is an autoimmune blood disorder.\nSebaceous adenitis is an autoimmune skin disorder believed to be of autosomal recessive inheritance.\nPemphigus foliaceus is an autoimmune skin disorder, believed to be genetic.\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or lupus, is a systemic autoimmune disease (or autoimmune connective tissue disease) that can affect any part of the body.\n\n\n=== Immune-mediated endocrine diseases ===\nIn addition to these there are also the immune-mediated endocrine diseases with a heritable factor, such as:\n\nHypoadrenocorticism also known as Addison's disease, it affects the adrenal glands and is essentially the opposite to Cushing's syndrome.\nDiabetes mellitus, also known as type 1 diabetes. It affects the pancreas.\nHypothyroidism, also known as autoimmune hypothyroidism. This is an autoimmune disease which affects the thyroid gland.\n\n\n=== Non-immune specific conditions ===\nOther non-immune specific conditions known to have occurred in the Akita include:\n\nGastric dilation is also known as bloat; may progressive to gastric dilatation volvulus (GDV), in which the stomach twists on itself.\nMicrophthalmia, meaning \"small eyes\", is a developmental disorder of the eye, believed to be an autosomal recessive genetic condition.\nPrimary glaucoma, Increased pressure in the eye.\nProgressive retinal atrophy progressive degeneration of the retina (portion of the eye that senses light and allows sight).\nHip dysplasia a skeletal condition where the head of the femur does not fit properly into the hip socket. Leads to osteoarthritis and pain.\nElbow dysplasia a skeletal condition in which the components of the elbow joint (the humerus, radius, and ulna) do not line up properly, leading to osteoarthritis and pain.\nVon Willebrands disease, a genetic bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in Von Willebrand factor.\nCushing\u2019s Syndrome also known as hyperadrenocorticism, it affects the adrenal glands and is caused by long-term exposure to high levels of glucocorticosteroids, either manufactured by the body or given as medications.\n\n\n=== Breed specific conditions ===\nThere are two breed specific conditions mentioned in veterinary literature:\n\nImmune sensitivity to vaccines, drugs, insecticides, anesthetics and tranquilizers\nPseudohyperkalemia, a  rise in the amount of potassium that occurs due to its excessive leakage from red blood cells (RBCs) when blood is drawn. This can give a false indication of hyperkalemia on lab tests, hence the prefix pseudo, meaning false. This occurs because many eastern Asian breeds, including Akitas and Shiba Inus, have a higher level of potassium in their RBCs than other dogs.\n\n\n== Working life ==\nPredecessors of the modern Akita were used for hunting bear, wild boar and deer in Japan as late as 1957. They would be used to flush out the bear and keep it at bay until the hunter could come and kill it. Today, the breed is used primarily as a companion dog. However, the breed is currently also known to be used as therapy dogs, and compete in all dog competitions including: conformation showing, obedience trials, canine good citizen program, tracking trials and agility competition, as well as weight pulling, hunting and Schutzhund (i.e., personal protection dogs).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGinga: Nagareboshi Gin\nHachi: A Dog's Tale\nHokkaido (dog)\nKai Ken\nKishu\nLovely Muco\nNihon Ken Hozonkai\nShikoku (dog)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Further reading ===\nSkabelund, Aaron Herald (2011).

It is defined only by its purpose, which is that of a highly efficient sled dog. The husky is a blend of various Northern breeds, chosen particularly for skills such as pulling. Specializations in type exist within the category, such as freighting dogs (Mackenzie River husky, Malamute), sprint Alaskans (Eurohound), and distance Alaskans.\nThe Alaskan husky is the sled dog of choice for world-class dog sled racing. None of the purebred northern breeds can match it for sheer racing speed. Sprint-racing events such as the Fairbanks, Alaska Open North American Championship and the Anchorage Fur Rendezvous are invariably won by teams of Alaskan huskies, or Alaskans crossed with hounds or gun dogs. Hounds are valued for their speed and endurance. Winning sprint racing speeds often average more than 19 miles per hour (31 km/h) over three days' racing at 20 to 30 miles (32 to 48 km) each day.\nHuskies that fulfill the demanding performance standards of world-class dogsled racing are extremely valuable. A top-level racing lead dog can be worth $3,000\u2013$10,000. Alaskans that fail to meet the performance standards of the musher who bred them often go on to be sold to less competitive mushers, allowing them to continue to run.\n\n\n== Lineage ==\nThe first dogs arrived in the Americas 12,\u2009000 years ago, however people and their dogs did not settle in the Arctic until the Paleo-Eskimo people 4,500 years ago and then the Thule people 1,000 years ago, both originating from Siberia. In 2015, a study using a number of genetic markers indicated that the Alaskan husky, the Siberian Husky and the Alaskan Malamute share a close genetic relationship between each other and were related to Chukotka sled dogs from Siberia. They were separate to the two Inuit dogs, the Canadian Eskimo Dog and the Greenland dog. In North America, the Siberian Husky and the Malamute both had maintained their Siberian lineage and had contributed significantly to the Alaskan husky, which showed evidence of crossing with European breeds that was consistent with this breed being created in post-colonial North America. The modern Alaskan Husky reflects a century or more of cross-breeding with Pointers, Shepherds, and Salukis to improve their performance.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nAlaskan huskies are moderate in size, averaging 40 to 60 pounds (21 to 25 kg) for males, and 35 to 55 pounds (17 to 19 kg) for females. Some of them superficially resemble racing strains of the Siberian husky breed (which is part of the Alaskan husky genetic mix), but are usually smaller and leaner with a more pronounced tuck-up.\nColor and markings can vary; Alaskans may be of any possible canine color and any pattern of markings. Eyes may be of any color. Coats are almost always short to medium in length, never long. The shorter coat length is governed by the need for effective heat dissipation while racing.\nIn very cold conditions, Alaskans often race in \u201cdog coats\u201d and/or belly protectors. Particularly in long distance races, these dogs often require \u201cdog booties\u201d to protect their feet from abrasion and cracking. The qualities of hardiness and climate resistance which are prevalent in breeds such as the Siberian husky and Canadian Inuit Dog are subordinated in the Alaskan husky to the overriding consideration of speed. On long-distance races, they require considerable care and attention on the trail at rest stops.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Alaskan husky is generally a healthy dog. Some strains are prone to genetic health problems similar to those found in purebred dog breeds. These may include PRA, hypothyroidism, etc.\nDogs with a congenital deformation of the larynx, termed \"wheezers\", occasionally occur. This disorder typically causes the dog to make a wheezing noise when breathing. The defect is suspected to be genetically linked. Theories of common exterior traits among \"wheezers\" abound, but are conflicting and undocumented. Because Mushers have selectively bred Alaskan Huskies to not be picky eaters, Alaskan Huskies are prone to be garbage eaters in urban settings.  This tends to cause frequent stomach and bowel issues in urban Alaska.\nThe life span of the Alaskan husky is usually between 10 and 15 years.\n\n\n== History ==\nToday, Alaskan Huskies may be hound crosses, husky types, or a combination of both. They also range in size and build depending on the use of the dog, whether for racing or for working. A working sled dog may be 50 to 80 lbs and a racing sled dog may be 35 to 60 lbs for a male or female. The old-time village dogs were bred to imported Siberian dogs, and more recently to European dogs.\nRacing sled dogs vary greatly in type, and may contain purebred pointer or hound to the modern Eurohound, a sprint dog that is unmatched for winning sprint races and is a predominantly black-colored combination of husky and German Shorthaired Pointer. Alaskan huskies intended for distance racing will compete 50 to 1,000 miles, where as mid-distance dogs compete 20 to 250 miles. Many of them retain the much-sought-after thick coat, balanced bodies, and tough feet of other northern breeds. Alaskan Huskies with hound or pointer bloodlines may sometimes wear booties and coats during races due to shorter and thinner coat, and less hardy feet.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nAlaskan Huskies tend to vary as greatly in personality as in color and appearance.  However, generally speaking, the Alaskan Husky is a very affectionate dog. There are several types of Alaskan Husky, varying in disposition and appearance due to the variety of breeds used to create them according to their intended function.  Ameri-Indian Alaskan Husky is a focused breed type that shows strong family focus as well as being multi-functional disciplined, reflecting the dogs once owned by Native Americans. Alaskan Huskies, like Siberian Huskies, tend to wander.\nAlaskan Huskies are generally very good with other dogs and gentle with people.  They are ferocious eaters and can be food fixated.\nThe coat of Alaskan Huskies is self-cleaning. They can be trained or encouraged to be active swimmers.  They don't take to retrieving naturally.  Due to the inclusion of sight-hound in their genetic make-up, Alaskans can have very good vision and a strong nose. Alaskan Huskies can sometimes possess a strong prey drive.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 9, "name": "Alaskan Klee Kai", "country": "United States", "type": "Northern Breed", "picture": "dog9", "description": "The Alaskan Klee Kai is a spitz type breed of dog, developed in the 1970s to create a companion sized dog resembling the Alaskan Husky (a mixed breed of dog used for sled racing). It is an energetic, intelligent,  dog with an appearance that reflects its northern heritage.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe breed was developed in Wasilla, Alaska, from the early 1970s to 1988 by Linda S. Spurlin and her family.  The breed was developed with Siberian and Alaskan Huskies, using Schipperke and American Eskimo Dog to bring down the size without dwarfism. She bred these dogs in private until she released them to the general public in 1988. Originally called the Klee Kai, the breed split into Alaskan Klee Kai and Klee Kai for political reasons in 1995. The breed consolidated as its current name in 2002. Though a relatively new breed the Alaskan Klee Kai has a rich history. They are extremely energetic and intelligent, and their northern heritage is evident in their appearance. In contrast to Siberian Huskies, which were originally bred as sled dogs, the Alaskan Klee Kai were bred as companion dogs. The Alaskan Klee Kai was officially recognized by the American Rare Breed Association (ARBA) in 1995 and by the United Kennel Club (UKC) on January 1, 1997.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\n\n=== Height and Weight ===\nIt is intended that the Alaskan Klee Kai remain a small to medium-sized dog. Height is measured from the withers to the ground. An Alaskan Klee Kai should not appear heavy or too thin. Weight should be proportionate to height. This breed is part of the Spitz family and looks like a miniature Alaskan Husky. According to breed standards, an adult Alaskan Klee Kai should be between 13 and 17 inches in height. They can be toy, miniature, or standard variety and weigh between 5 and 22 lbs. The breed has an average life expectancy of between 12 and 16 years.\nToy Variety: Up to and including 13 in (33 cm)\nMiniature Variety: Over 13 in (33 cm) and up to and including 15 in (38 cm).\nStandard Variety: Over 15 in (38 cm) up to and including 17 in (43 cm).\nSerious Fault: Over 17 in (43 cm) up to and including 17.5 in (44 cm).\nEliminating Fault: Over 17.5 in (44 cm) in height.\n\n\n=== Coat and coloring ===\n\nAlaskan Klee Kai come in three recognized color varieties: black and white, gray and white, or red and white (which may appear as a cinnamon or a dark auburn). Solid white Alaskan Klee Kai also exist but this coat color variety is considered a disqualification by the breed standard.  Solid white Alaskan Klee Kai have just recently become recognized by the United Kennel Club and may be registered but not shown competitively.\nThere are also two coat types found in the breed.  These consist of the standard and full-coated varieties.  Both are recognized by the UKC and equally acceptable by the breed standard.  The only exception being that the coat length may not be so long as to obscure the outline of the dog, which is considered a breed fault.  The Alaskan Klee Kai has a double coat; an undercoat that is short and soft and an outer coat that is made of longer guard hairs.  This double coat allows them to have thermal protection from extreme hot and cold weather.\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\nLike the Siberian Husky, the Alaskan Klee Kai typically requires relatively easy care. They are extremely clean. Most do not like wet feet and will spend hours daily grooming themselves. Alaskan Klee Kai, like many other northern breeds, do not have a typical \"doggy odor\" or \"doggy breath.\" Most Klee Kai will seldom require a bath. They are rather efficient, so no grooming is needed.  An Alaskan Klee Kai should not be shaved unless for medical reasons.   They need their coat to keep them cool and to protect their skin.Also like Siberians (and unlike short haired dogs who shed all year), the Klee Kai blows its coat twice a year, while they also shed continuously during the year. Of course, the size of the dogs limits the amount of fur blown. It is best to groom the dog on a regular basis during this time. Some of the longer haired dogs can become matted if not groomed. Most Klee Kai will assist the loss of hair by rubbing against things such as fences. Other than this period of blowing coat, the Klee Kai is very self-sufficient. The normal preventative measures should be taken, such as trimming of nails, normal grooming in the form of brushing. This process is especially important in the bonding process.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nMost people compare the Alaskan Klee Kai to the popular Siberian Husky due to their similar fur markings. While they are both Spitz breed dogs, the Alaskan Klee Kai is significantly smaller in size. They are also behaviorally almost utmost opposites to their large husky counterparts; they tend to be shy, skittish and wary around strangers.  The Alaskan Klee Kai is a highly intelligent, playful, curious and high energy breed. They can be standoffish and cautious, and sometimes defensive around unfamiliar individuals. Because of their inherently reserved disposition in the presence of strangers, continual socialization throughout an Alaskan Klee Kai's life is highly encouraged. They are moderately active and have a strong prey drive, keeping them on a leash is necessary as they will pursue any distraction that comes their way. This means unless they are properly introduced and raised with smaller animals such as rabbits, hamsters, cats, and birds, they will hunt them.\nThey can be a great family dog if raised with young children who are careful with animals: Alaskan Klee Kai are not likely to tolerate being mistreated and should be monitored when with children. Because of their intelligence, they do well in obedience classes and have a high drive to please their owners which helps them to excel in this area as well as many other types of activities. Another such activity is agility in which the Alaskan Klee Kai almost seems to have been bred to take part. However, a lack of stimulation tends to lead these dogs to be mischievous or even destructive, but this can be avoided through regular exercise.\nThe Alaskan Klee Kai are generally quiet dogs and are not known to be problem barkers, but it is common for Klee Kai to create vocalizations and to \"talk\" similar to other northern breeds.\n\n\n== Health ==\nPreviously the Alaskan Klee Kai was thought to have been remarkably free of genetic defects when compared to other small dog breeds. Current health concerns with this breed are: Thyroid Disease, Autoimmune Thyroditis, FVII Deficiency, juvenile cataracts, liver disease, pyometra, patellar luxation, cryptorchidism, and cardiac issuesOther health concerns that the breed may suffer from  have yet to be discovered because of the breed's relatively young age and small gene pool.\nResponsible Alaskan Klee Kai breeders have their dogs health tested and registered with OFA for cardiac, patellar, and thyroid issues. They are now accepted by CHIC if they have passed their OFA exams and eye exam by CERF.\n\n\n== References ==\nAlaskan Klee Kai dog breed."}, {"id": 10, "name": "Alaskan Malamute", "country": "United States", "type": "Northern Breed", "picture": "dog10", "description": "The Alaskan Malamute  is a large breed of domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) originally bred for their strength and endurance to haul heavy freight, and later as a sled dog. They are similar to other arctic breeds and spitz breeds, such as the Greenland Dog, Canadian Eskimo Dog, the Siberian Husky, and the Samoyed.\n\n\n== Lineage ==\nAlthough it is believed that the first dogs arrived in the Americas 12,000 years ago, people and their dogs did not settle in the Arctic until the Eskimo people 4,500 years ago and then the Thule people 1,000 years ago, both originating from Siberia. Malamutes were bred by the Malemiut Inupiaq people of Alaska's Norton Sound region, who were a Thule people.\nThe Malamute has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th Century. A study in 2013 showed that the Alaskan Malamute has a similar east Asian origin to, but is not clearly related to, the Greenland Dog and the Canadian Eskimo Dog, but contains a  possible admixture of the Siberian Husky.In 2015, a study using a number of genetic markers indicated that the Malamute, the Siberian Husky, and the Alaskan husky share a close genetic relationship between each other and were related to Chukotka sled dogs from Siberia. They were separate from the two Inuit dogs, the Canadian Eskimo Dog and the Greenland Dog. In North America, the Malamute and the Siberian Husky both had maintained their Siberian lineage and had contributed significantly to the Alaskan husky, which showed evidence of crossing with European breeds that was consistent with this breed being created in post-colonial North America.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standard describes a natural range of size, with a desired size of 23 inches (58 cm) tall and 75 pounds (34 kg) for females, 25 inches (64 cm) tall and 85 pounds (39 kg) for males. Heavier individuals (90 lb (41 kg)) and dogs smaller than 75 pounds (34 kg) are commonly seen. There is often a marked size difference between males and females. Weights upwards of 100 pounds (45 kg) are also seen.The coat of the Alaskan Malamute is a double coat. The undercoat has an oily and woolly texture and can be as thick as two inches. The outer guard coat is coarse and stands off the body\u2014longer at the withers but not more than one inch off the sides of the body. Ears are small in proportion to the head and stand firmly erect when at attention. The Alaskan Malamute is a heavy dog, with a more formidable nature and structure than the Siberian Husky, which is bred for speed. The Alaskan Malamute is bred for power and endurance, which is its original function and what the standard of the breed requires of Alaskan Malamute breeders.\n\nThe usual colors are various shades of gray and white, sable and white, black and white, seal and white, red and white, or solid white. There are a wide range of markings in the breed including face markings, blazes, a splash at the nape of the neck, and a collar or half collar. In terms of color variants, some Malamutes exhibit a dark grey to buff-colored undertone around their trimmings and white areas, presenting with a color-linked gene known as 'Agouti'. The eyes of the Alaskan Malamute are almond-shaped and are varied shades of brown; however, the darker eye is preferred. The physical build of the Malamute is compact and strong with substance, bone and snowshoe feet.\nAccording to the AKC breed standard, the Malamute's tail is well furred and is carried over the back like a \"waving plume\". Corkscrew tails are occasionally seen but are faulted in the AKC breed standard (a corkscrew tail is commonly seen in the Akita). The Malamutes' well-furred tails aid in keeping them warm when they curl up in the snow. They are often seen wrapping the tail around their nose and face, which presumably helps protect them against harsh weather such as blowing snow. Their ears are generally upright, wedge-shaped, small in proportion to the head and set to the side of the skull. The muzzle is deep and broad, tapering slightly from the skull to the nose. Nose and gums are black but some Malamutes have a snow nose, which is black with a pink undertone that can get darker or lighter, depending on the season.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nAlaskan Malamutes are still in use as sled dogs for personal travel, hauling freight, or helping move light objects; some, however, are used for the recreational pursuit of sledding, also known as mushing, as well as for skijoring, bikejoring, carting, and canicross. However, most Malamutes today are kept as family pets or as show or performance dogs in weight pulling, dog agility, or packing. Malamutes are generally slower in long-distance dog sled racing against smaller and faster breeds, so their working usefulness is limited to freighting or traveling over long distances at a far slower rate than required for racing. They can also help move heavy objects over shorter distances. An adult male Alaskan Malamute can pull around 500\u20131,500 kilograms (1,100\u20133,300 lb) of weight, depending on build and training.\nThe Malamute has a long genetic foundation of living in harsh environments, and many of its behaviors have adapted to survive in such environments. Independence, resourcefulness, high intelligence, and natural behaviors are common in the breed.\nMalamutes, like other Northern and sled dog breeds, can have a high prey drive, due to their origins and breeding. This may mean that in some cases they will chase smaller animals, including other canines, as well as rabbits, squirrels, and cats. While Malamutes are, as a general rule, particularly amicable around people and can be taught to tolerate smaller pets, it is necessary to be mindful of them around smaller animals and small children.\nMalamutes are very fond of people, a trait that makes them particularly sought-after family dogs, but unreliable watchdogs. Malamutes are nimble around furniture and smaller items, making them ideal house dogs, provided they get plenty of time outdoors meeting their considerable exercise requirements. Alaskan Malamutes also often participate in animal therapy programs, like visiting patients in hospitals, due to their soft nature. If they are year-round outdoor dogs, letting them play in a baby pool filled with cold water in summer keeps them cool. In the winter, they prefer snow.\nMalamutes are usually quiet dogs, seldom barking. When a Malamute does vocalize, it often appears to be \"talking\" by vocalizing a \"woo woo\" sound. It may howl like a gray wolf or coyote, and for the same reason.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThere is only one known health survey of Alaskan Malamutes, a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey with a small sample size of 14 dogs. The median lifespan of 10.7 years measured in that survey is typical of a breed their size; however, this study had a sample size too small to be considered reliable and much anecdotal evidence suggests they have on average one of the longest lifespans of large dogs, up to 15 years. The major cause of death was cancer (36%).The most commonly reported health problems of Alaskan Malamutes, in the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey (based on a sample size of 64 dogs) were musculoskeletal (hip dysplasia), and hereditary cataracts. There are additional health issues in the breed whose origins are unknown at this time including varied seizure disorders found in young puppies as well as adults, epilepsy, congenital heart problems, kidney problems and skin disorders.Other health issues in Malamutes include Elbow dysplasia, inherited polyneuropathy, osteochondrodysplasia, cerebella hypoplasia, heart defects, and eye problems (particularly cataract and progressive retinal atrophy). A growing problem among arctic dog breeds, including the Alaskan Malamute, but especially their cousin, the Samoyed, is canine diabetes with onset occurring typically in middle age (5 to 7 years).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Alaskan Malamute had a prominent role with their human companions \u2013 as a utilitarian dog, working, hunting, and living alongside humans. The dogs were renowned for their excellent hunting abilities and were used to hunt large predators such as bears. They also aided their owners in finding seals by alerting to seal blow holes. The interdependent relationship between the Mahlemut and their dogs fostered prosperity among both and enabled them to flourish in the inhospitable land above the Arctic Circle.\nFor a brief period during the Klondike Gold Rush of 1896, the Malamute and other sled dogs became extremely valuable to recently landed prospectors and settlers, and were frequently crossbred with imported breeds. This was often an attempt to improve the type, or to make up for how few true Malamutes were available to purchase.\n(AKC) \"Breed recognition came in 1935, largely through the efforts of Mrs. Eva B. Seeley. At that time many dogs were of unknown ancestry. Those who appeared purebred were used for breeding, others weeded out. After a few years the registry was closed.\"\"Losses from service in World War II all but eliminated the breed. In 1947 there were estimated to be only about 30 registered dogs left, so the stud book was reopened. Robert J. Zoller  became involved in the breed and took this opportunity to combine M\u2019Loot and Hinman/Irwin dogs with selected Kotzebues to create what became the Husky-Pak line. All modern Malamutes are descended from the early strains, and show combinations of characteristics in greater or lesser degree. Thus the natural differences we see today.\"The Malamute dog has had a distinguished history; aiding Rear Admiral Richard Byrd to the South Pole, and the miners who came to Alaska during the Gold Rush of 1896, as well as serving in World War II primarily as search and rescue dogs in Greenland, although also used as freighting and packing dogs in Europe. This dog was never destined to be a racing sled dog; it was used for heavy freighting, pulling hundreds, perhaps thousands of pounds of supplies to villages and camps in groups of at least four dogs for heavy loads.\nIn 2010 the Alaskan Malamute was named the official state dog of Alaska.\n\n\n== Research ==\n\n\n=== Predicting Behavior ===\nIn 2018, researchers at the University of Washington recorded the behavior of an Alaskan Malamute by attaching sensors to its paws, torso and tail, allowing them to capture its normal movements. The data was inputted into a machine learning system with the aim of predicting the dog's behavior in various situations. The predictive ability of the software was only limited to short time frames, but it was able to identify 'walkable' surfaces after observing the dog walk on, or avoid, certain surfaces.\n\n\n=== Bite-related Fatalities ===\nA 2000 investigation published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association examined the \"Breeds of dogs involved in fatal human attacks in the United States between 1979 and 1998\" .  The journal authors made several notes on the original article, including the fact that police dogs were excluded from the numbers.  \nPitBullInfo.org, a website published by a not-for-profit organization, calculated breed-specific risk rates by adjusting fatality incidents relative to the breed's population size.  The Malamute was responsible for 6.79 bite-related fatalities per 100,000 dogs (for every 100,000 Malamute dogs, about 7 people will die from a dog bite).  The second-highest fatality rate was the Chow Chow at 2.32.  Pitbull-type dogs came in at 0.97 .  \nThus, as a breed, Malamutes appear to be far more likely to fatally kill people than other dogs, but because their overall population is small, these events do not occur as frequently as deaths from other breeds; an increase in the number of Malamutes would, presumably, increase dog bite-related fatalities. This does not necessarily indicate that Malamutes are more likely to bite than other dogs; a small dog could bite more often, for example, but those bites may result in fewer fatalities.  It should be noted that although pitbullinfo.org claims to be published by a not-for-profit organization, that organization is not disclosed on their website. Thus, skeptics may choose to calculate the fatality rate independently by adjusting the original data by the population of each breed between 1979 and 1998.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlaskan Malamute at Curlie\nFacts and Information about Alaskan Malamute\nWorld pedigree database"}, {"id": 11, "name": "Alaunt", "country": "Albania", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog11", "description": "The Alaunt is an extinct breed of dog, with the original breed having existed in central Asia, Afghanistan and Europe from ancient times through the 17th century.  \n\n\n== Features ==\n\nIn France, the Alaunt breed had three distinct types: Alaunt Veantre, Alaunt Boucherie and the Alaunt Gentile.  They all were large, short coated dogs of varying head-types. The former two resembled the molosser type dogs much like the present-day Dogo Argentino or like the Caucasian Shepherd Dog except with short hair and a mesocephalic head which made them excellent large-game hunters.   The Alaunt was originally bred by the Alani tribes, the nomads of Indo-European Sarmatian ancestry who spoke an Iranian language. The Alans were known as superb warriors, herdsmen, and breeders of horses and dogs. The Alans bred their dogs for work and developed different strains within the breed for specific duties. The breed was further developed in Spain, France, Germany, England, and in Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Molossus descended into Epirus in about 1200 BC, also from the north. However, their artifacts did not resemble the Mastiff prototype, as they had a long nose of a narrow type, and a long mane. Varro, however, described a herding dog of Epirus which was white, large headed, and slightly undershot, used to defend sheep and goats. One group of Alans arrived in what is now Albania in the fifth or sixth centuries BC. Molossis of Epirus is located in Southern Albania. It is most plausible the Alaunt gave rise to the fighting dogs of the Molossi, which were introduced to Britain by Roman Invasion in 55BC. The Alans provided cavalry for Rome and in 50AD, 5,500 Alans were sent to Britain to guard Hadrian's Wall. Thus, the Alaunt genetic template most plausibly gave rise to the British Pugnaces as fighting dogs which English Mastiffs and Bulldogs descend from.\nIn the 370s AD, Hun invasions divided the Alani into the Eastern and Western Alans. The Eastern Alani tribes merged with the Ossetians and other nations, introducing their dogs into the bloodlines of many Balkan breeds, such as the Shar Mountain Dog, Metchkar, Qen Ghedje, Hellenikos Poimenikos and other Molossers of the region. Some believe that the white-coloured Alaunts were the direct ancestors of Balkan breeds, which in turn influenced all other white dogs in the Balkans. \n\nThe Western Alans joined the Vandals on their raids through Europe and by the 410s AD, their fierce dogs were influencing many breeds in France, Spain, Portugal, England and other countries, spreading the use of the \"alaunt\" name, which became synonymous with a type of a working dog, rather than a specific breed. Through breeding with various scenthounds and sighthounds, some alaunts became valued large game hunting dogs, existing in a variety of types, dictated by regional preferences. In 1500 AD, Spain was known for breeding the best Alaunts and used them to conquer the New World. \nIn France, Alaunts were separated into three main categories, based on physical appearance and the duties they performed. The lightest type was the Alaunt Gentil, a greyhound-like dog, which eventually became assimilated into the local hunting breeds with the Alaunt Veantre. The original mastiff variety, known as the Alaunt de Boucherie, was crucial in the development of the fighting and baiting dogs of France. The Alaunt de Boucherie in France was known as the Alaunt Butchers in England and the Alano in Spain and Italy and were termed the original Bulldogs as they were used to control and defend herds of cattle. In Spain, the three categories were the Mastins, Alanos, and Lebrels, further separated as the ayuda (defense types) and the presa (offense types), such as the Presa Canario, Fila Brasileiro, and Cuban Mastiff.\n\n\n== Form ==\nThe long, broad, flat head of the Alaunt should never be confused with the modified brachycephalic breeds. The brachycephalic head type is wide in base, but short in length.. While the preferred bite is reverse scissor, like the Mastiff, and may have been a trait introduced by the Mongolian breeds at some remote time in history, skull type and bite type are separate subjects of genetic traits. The dolichocephalic skull is narrow at base yet long in length, so the Alaunt could be referred to as a modified dolichocephalic breed, as mesocephalic is a balance of base to length. Moreover, the Alaunt or Mastiff must be separated from the Molossoides in head study, as this term does not separate the Mastiff from the Mountain Dogs or even the Pug. \n\n\n== Modern relatives ==\n\nContemporary enthusiasts are developing new breeds based on Alaunt bloodlines, such as the British Alaunt, New Alaunt, Antebellum Bulldog or Altamaha Plantation Dog, Dogo Belgrado, Abraxas bulldog and the American Alaunt. While its origins are strongly rooted in the ancient mountain dogs of the East, the Alaunt is regarded by some cynologists as the ancestor to the original bulldog breeds.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlano Espa\u00f1ol\nCane Corso\nPerro de Presa Canario\nGreat Dane\nGreyhound\nHound\nDogo\nDogo Argentino\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFleig, Dieter (1996).

The name Alopekis means \u201csmall fox\u201d or \u201cfox-like\u201d in the Greek language. The breed is mentioned by several ancient Greek and classical writers such as Aristotle, Xenophon, and Aristophanes, and is depicted in many archaeological finds such as pottery, carvings, statuettes, sculpture, and tomb monuments.\n\n\n== History and origins ==\nThe oldest representation comes from prehistoric neolithic times. It is an inscribed terracotta vessel dating back to 3000 years BC from Thessaly, bearing the schematic outline of the characteristic silhouette of the Alopekis and is now at the Archaeology Museum of Athens. This relic places the breed in the same era and geographic location as the proto-Hellenic \u03a0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b3\u03bf\u03af (Pelasgians) people. It is the oldest dog artefact in the Hellenic world. A similar artefact was found in Asketario, Rafina and dated from the Early Bronze Age.Dog domestication in the Hellenic geographical region pre-dates, based on the analyses of the findings so far, the pro-ceramic Neolithic era, which in Greece started in the 7th millennium BC. Dog bones similar to those described as turf-dogs or marshland dogs or dogs of peat or dogs of the lake-dwellers (Canis familiaris palustris) were found in the oldest strata of the neolithic settlements at Sitagroi and Sesklo. The fact that these settlements and findings are much older than the central-European ones (in some instances twice as old) allows for the reasonable hypothesis that the ancestor of the European Spitz breeds (assumed to be Canis familiaris palustris R\u00fctimeyer), did not actually first emerge in Central Europe but in the region of Greece; therefore Alopekis is a strong candidate as one of the oldest breeds/landraces, if not the oldest dog type to emerge in Europe; something that it would be very interesting to test in the laboratory, by comparing DNA from the neolithic bones and contemporary specimens.\nAnother name used for the breed in ancient times was \u039a\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03ce\u03c0\u03b7\u03be [Cynalopex, from the Greek cyn (short for kyon) = dog and alopex = fox] as the ancient Greeks believed It was created from matings between dogs and foxes. Newer traditional local names recorded include Alepouditsa (little fox), Bobis and Bouboudi (from Serres), Moropa / Venetaki (used in Crete), Zacharoskylo (sugar \u2013 dog, referring to the spotless white colour of some specimen, as well as their sweet nature, used in Skiathos).\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\nAccording to the most universally accepted cynological classification (FCI Spitz and Primitive Types Group), the breed belongs to the Primitive Group of dogs. The Alopekis has erect ears, a wedge-shaped head, normal (scissors) bite and dentition and a mesomorphic, normal-symmetrical structure, body type and morphology. Typical specimens do not display elements of dwarfism. Their bodies are strong and their legs are neither bowed nor notably or disproportionately shortened. Acquired leg deformities are also undesirable characteristics. The breed's proportions suggest a gradual reduction in size over time (genetic sweep) due to evolution, selection and local adaptation. It is also possible that the breed shares some ancestry, together with the Cretan Hound, from the smaller and more slender Ethiopian Wolf (Canis simensis) and perhaps even the Southern sub-species Canis simensis citernii, rather than the larger and heavier Grey wolf (Canis lupus) ancestral species. Alopekis morphology suggests a natural \u2013 archaic dog type, ancestral / archetypical to the subsequent central European small Spitz/ Nordic and Terrier breeds. The Pomeranian dog, said to be a descendant of ancient Dalmatian / Illyrian dogs and especially those from the island of Melite / Melita (Mljet) in the Adriatic Sea, which used to be a Greek territory until the 12th century, is probably a descendant of the Alopekis and the Meliteo Kynidio / Small Greek Domestic Dog. Additionally, the hunting ability of the Alopekis, is a further indication that suggests a relation to other breeds of this group [Group V of the F.C.I. Classification that were developed in other Mediterranean regions after the Greek colonization in Southern Italy, Sicily, Malta, Cyrene, Corsica, Southern France, the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic islands, probably with the influence of larger hounds such as the Cretan Hound, as suggested by the existence in Crete of a small type similar to the Alopekis, in morphology and use, as a hunting and utility dog, which in modern times is called Venetaki (possibly from the Latin venaticus = hunting as Crete was under Venetian occupation from 1212 to 1669); in ancient times this dog was possibly identical to the type called  \u039a\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2 (Gr. Kynamolgos, cynomolgus = milking dog).\n\n\n== Cynological type and relations ==\nAlopekis dogs represent a type dating back to the pre-specialisation era, since they combine hunting, herding and guarding abilities and other primitive characteristics of conformation and behaviour. The passage from Ctesias, mentioned by Julius Pollux, about the Cynomolgus dogs of Crete, is especially interesting, as it refers to dogs co-existing with buffalo / cattle herds and even suckling the milking cows and competing with bulls. It is possible that descendants of those dogs travelled to Northern Europe with the Greeks, the Romans, the Celts and later the Romani people (according to folk traditions) and contributed to breeds such as the Welsh Corgi and the Lancashire Heeler. The ancestors of the latter are said to have been brought to Britain by Romani people from the Mediterranean. The fact that these breeds are the only (together with the Alopekis) small \u2013 size contemporary breeds specializing in cattle-driving and herding (cattle dogs being in their vast majority much larger and of molossoid / molosser type), is quite remarkable in itself; it could also be seen as additional evidence, apart from the obvious physical similarities, that there is a shared genetic relation and common adaptation and specialization of the herding instinct in all these three breeds, originating in the Eastern regions of Crete (where marshland habitats were ideal for water buffalo herds), given the specific importance of the bull worship in the island's ancient history. The bull games or taurokathapsia (bull-leaping), a form of gymnastics performed by young acrobats and bulls in ancient Crete, are quite well-known; reading Ctesias' report, one wonders if dogs were ever included, or used to control any bull that became too aggressive during the games or the training sessions. (This passage also underlines the co-existence and inevitable genetic interaction between Cretan populations of Alopekis and Cretan Hounds. According to a very interesting report recorded by the Hellenic Association for the Protection and Rescue of Native Farm and Domestic Animals Breeds \u201cAmaltheia\u201d, there was until very recently a group of Alopekis dogs escorting water buffalo herds in Northern Greece. One of the areas where the breed still co-exists with water buffalo (brought to Greece by invading armies during the Persian Wars) is Serres. And the breed still serves flocks of sheep and goats and cattle also, in other parts of the country, to this day.\n\n\n== Traditional role and character ==\nAlopekis populations existed until recently all over Greece and some of their traditional uses were ratting and the extermination of mice and other small vermin, as well as protection of poultry, such as domestic chickens and ducks from the attacks of foxes; the small dogs can easily fit in the hen coops and curl up inside to spend the night on vigil against their namesake intruder; they also co-operate very well with the bigger flock- guardians and sheepdogs in the farm and on the field. The breed is an excellent and brave little watchdog and quite strong for its size. Before the mass importation of foreign breeds to Greece that started in the 1970s and '80s, the undisputed majority of small dogs in urban and rural areas were mostly Alopekis and Melieo Kynidio or Kokoni.\n\n\n== Alopekis today ==\n\n\n=== Problems ===\nThis charismatic, multi-purpose and ancient breed of dog is valued as a unique example of small canine evolution. However, their traditionally healthy gene pool has been threatened in modern times by urbanisation, farming pesticides, cross-breeding with foreign imported dogs and the lacking of a registering body. Although there is no specific data on the impact of this zoonosis on Alopekis populations, endemic proportions of the seasonal leishmaniasis infection are believed to be responsible as well. Exacerbating the problem are the low number of puppies per litter, the high mortality of newborn puppies in the rural environment, as well as the single-oestrus per year status of the breed. Also, despite the endangered status of the breed, many Alopekis have been neutered as a result of indiscriminate policies designed to curb the increase in the number of stray dogs. A group of scientists led by veterinary surgeon Prof. Spyros Chleiounakis have been monitoring a local population of the breed in a specific area of Northern Greece since 2005. The recent publication of their study and subsequent articles in the Greek and foreign press in February 2013, call for the protection of the last few pure Alopekis left in Greece.\n\n\n=== Conservation effort ===\nA small group of dog lovers and canine historians and connoisseurs that have been championing the case for the small native breeds since the 1970s and '80s and have contributed, in 2004, to the successful recognition of one of these, the Kokoni, by the Kennel Club of Greece, is trying, in co-operation with Amaltheia volunteers, to attract attention to the plight of the Alopekis and the looming danger of extinction.\n\n\n== Physical characteristics and body conformation ==\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nThe breed occurs in three different coat varieties, all with an undercoat: a) relatively short, hard and flat, b) semi-long, profuse and harsh and c) a semi-long, hard, wire coat with some facial furnishings. The wire-haired variety is extremely rare. The coat must never be thin, sparse, soft and silky or lack a protective and insulating undercoat as the breed is a small utility dog that should be able to thrive outdoors as well as inside. Winters in the mountains of northern Greece can be quite harsh in particular, and the summers can be very hot, so a good coat quality is essential. The coat is easy to groom and inherently easy to keep clean by a caretaker. This is in part because Alopecis dogs are very clean by their nature and often groom themselves meticulously. The breed does not seem to attract as many external parasites as others.\n\n\n=== Colour ===\nAll colours and combinations of colours are acceptable apart from total depigmentation (albinism). Typical colours include pure white, black or brown, as well as any bicolour combination of them: black and white, white with black or brown patches, black with white markings, brown with tan markings.\n\n\n=== Size ===\nSizes range from 20 to 30 centimetres (7.9 to 11.8 in) at the withers and weigh between 3.5 to 7.5 kilograms (7.7 to 16.5 lb). Unlike most other small dog breeds, its size is due to insular dwarfism rather than selective breeding.\n\n\n== Temperament and working abilities ==\nThe Alopekis as a house companion is very affectionate, reliable, devoted, lively, active but not highly-strung nor yappy dog. The typical temperament is confident, outgoing, sociable, happy and very easy to train. Protective and caring towards the other house pets or animals, yet a determined enemy of vermin, a very diligent little worker, a capable hunter and retriever of game and quite playful. The breed is very good with children. As a utility dog and watchdog the Alopekis is courageous, vigilant, alert, spirited and able to cover the distance tirelessly, athletic and with very quick reflexes. At farm or city this is a very useful little working dog and escort that adapts well to all environments and is a joy to live with for dog-lovers of any age and lifestyle.\n\n\n== Health and lifespan ==\n\nAlopecis dams, in contrast to modern breeds, only come to season once a year; they are very good mothers and easy whelpers. Litter size is typically 3, at the most 4 or 5 puppies.\nThe breed enjoys excellent health and vitality and does not suffer for any known physical weaknesses. On the contrary they are quite robust little dogs that do well with moderate care and are not fussy eaters. Their average lifespan is 12\u201315 years in a domestic environment. Hereditary diseases have not been reported.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nThe breed is not yet recognized by any national or international organisation. The Kennel Club of Greece is reportedly waiting for an increase in population in order to consider the case. The breed hovers on the brink of extinction since the late 1990s.\n\n\n=== See also ===\nCretan Hound\nGreek Harehound\nGreek Shepherd\nKokoni Domestic Dog\nList of dog breeds\nKennel Club of Greece\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 13, "name": "Alpine Dachsbracke", "country": "Austria", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog13", "description": "The Alpine Dachsbracke (ger. Alpenl\u00e4ndische Dachsbracke) is a small breed of dog of the scent hound type originating in Austria. The Alpine Dachsbracke was bred to track wounded deer as well as boar, hare, and fox. It is highly efficient at following a trail even after it has gone cold. The Alpine Dachsbracke is very sturdy, and Austria is said to be the country of origin.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThis small dog has a slight resemblance to a Dachshund, with short legs (although longer than a dachshund\u2019s) and a long body. The coat is dense, short but smooth except for the tail and neck. The round eyes have a lively expression. Being very sturdy, the Alpine Dachsbracke is visibly robust and has a big boned structure.\nPreferred colors in competition are dark deer red with or without black hairs lightly interspersed. Black with red-brown markings on the head, chest, legs, feet, and tail are also permitted, as well as a white star on the chest (according to the American Rare Breed Association). The ideal height for dogs is 37\u201338 cm, and the ideal height for bitches is 36\u201337 cm. Strong limbs and feet, with black toenails and tight toes as well as strong elastic skin are features that judges look for in competition. They also look for a trotting gait. The top coat should be very thick, the undercoat dense and both closefitting to the body.The Alpine Dachsbracke weighs from 15 to 18 kg (33 to 40 lb) and stands from 34 to 42 cm (13 to 16 in) at the withers. It is often compared with the dachshund, as they are very similar in appearance.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nUsed effectively to track wounded deer, this breed could work even in harsh terrain and high altitude. It makes a good companion, although it is primarily a hunter and therefore is kept mostly by hunters. It has a fearless, friendly and intelligent personality. Most Alpine Dachsbrackes are excellent with children and good with dogs and other pets, though they may exhibit a strong prey drive typical of many scent dogs.\n\n\n== History ==\nAlpine Dachsbrackes, as with the other Bracke, can be dated back to the middle of the 19th century. The Dachsbrache were bred down in size by crossing the larger dogs with Dachshunds. It once was a favorite of German royalty. During the 1880s, Alpine Dachsbrackes accompanied Crown Prince Rudolf of Habsburg on hunting trips to Egypt and Turkey.\nThe F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale recognizes the Alpine Dachsbracke in Group 6 Scenthounds, Section 2  \u201cLeash Hounds\u201d with the Bavarian Mountain Scenthound (Bayrischer Gebirgsschweisshund, no. 217) and the Hanoverian Scenthound (Hannover'scher Schweisshund, no. 213). The only major kennel club in the English-speaking world to recognise the Alpine Dachsbracke is the United Kennel Club (US) in their Scenthound Group, but they use the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale breed standard. The breed is also recognized by a number of minor registries, hunting clubs, and internet-based dog registry businesses.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHunting dog\nScenthound\nFinnish Hound\nWestphalian Dachsbracke\nDrever (also called Swedish Dachsbracke)\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 14, "name": "Alpine Mastiff", "country": "Switzerland", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog14", "description": "The Alpine Mastiff is an extinct Molosser dog breed, the progenitor of the St. Bernard, and a major contributor to the modern Mastiff (through such dogs as \"Couchez\"), as well as to other breeds that derive from these breeds or are closely related to them. M.B. Wynn wrote, \"In 1829 a vast light brindle dog of the old Alpine mastiff breed, named L'Ami, was brought from the convent of Great St. Bernard, and exhibited in London and Liverpool as the largest dog in England.\" William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, is believed to have bred Alpine Mastiffs at Chatsworth House.\nThe names \"Alpine Mastiff\" and \"Saint Bernard\" were used interchangeably in the early 19th century, though the variety that was kept at the hospice at the Great St. Bernard Pass was significantly altered by introducing other breeds, including Newfoundland and Great Dane, and it is this composite breed that now carries the name St. Bernard. Inevitably these Mountain dogs filtered through to the wider population, and the original variety dwindled in its pure form, though a rare breed, the \"Cane Garouf\" or \"Patua\", found in the part of the Alps formerly inhabited by the Alpine Mastiff, may also descend from the extinct breed.\nThe Alpine Mastiff was, along with the Tibetan Mastiff and Caucasian Shepherd Dog, one of the earliest breeds of dog to reach truly gigantic size. It was one of the very first true mastiffs, originating in northern Europe before 500 B.C. The largest individuals may have reached more than 1 m (39 in) tall at the shoulder and weighed 160 kg (350 lb) or more, surpassing the modern Saint Bernard and English Mastiff in size. Beginning in the 1970s, there have been some efforts to breed back the Alpine Mastiff, mainly by using breeds such as the Saint Bernard, Great Dane, Great Pyrenees, and Bernese Mountain Dog.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlpine Spaniel (possibly a synonymous name)\nBarry (dog)\nMountain dog\nKumaon Mastiff\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMastiffs, the Big Game Hunters, Their History, Development and Future, Col.

The spaniel was a large dog notable for its thick curly coat. One of the most famous specimens of the Alpine Spaniel is Barry, however his preserved body has been modified on more than one occasion to fit with descriptions of the extinct breed from earlier time periods. Due to the conditions in the Alps, and a series of accidents, extinction was discussed as a possibility by authors during the 1830s, and at some point prior to 1847 the entire breed was reduced to a single example due to disease. Evidence held at the Natural History Museum in Bern show that two distinct breeds of dog were being used in the area during this time period. The breed is thought to be the predecessor to the modern St. Bernard and the Clumber Spaniel.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Alpine was a large breed of spaniel, described as reaching two feet at the withers and six feet from the nose to the tail. It had a closely set coat, curlier than that of the English Cocker Spaniel or the English Springer Spaniel. An intelligent breed, it was particularly adapted to the climate of the Swiss Alps.Old skulls in the collection of the Natural History Museum in Bern demonstrate a diversity in head shapes. The collection proves at least two distinct variations during the same time period. The larger skulls have a greater pronounced stop with a shorter muzzle while the smaller skulls show a great deal less stop whilst having longer muzzles.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAlpine spaniels were kept by the canons of the monasteries in the Alps in order to search for travellers during heavy snow storms, including the Great St Bernard Hospice in the Great St Bernard Pass between Italy and Switzerland. The dogs would be dispatched in pairs to search for fallen travellers, and were trained so that upon finding them would return to the canons in order to lead rescuers back to the unfortunate individuals. The Alpine breed was also used as a watchdog to guard sheep and cattle of mountainous regions, including the Himalayas.Between 1800 and 1814, a dog named Barry lived as a rescue dog at the hospice, and was famous enough at the time for his body to be preserved at the Natural History Museum of Bern. However, during the preservation, the taxidermist and the director of the Museum agreed to modify the body towards what they thought was a good example of the breed during that period. The head itself was further modified in 1923 to represent the Saint Bernard of that era. Prior to this the skull was a great deal flatter with a moderate stop.In 1829 a Mastiff like dog was brought from the Great St Bernard Hospice and was exhibited in London and Liverpool to thousands of people. This publicised the existence of an Alpine Mastiff, but drawings of the dog did not match descriptions of the Alpine Spaniel from before the exhibition, and the descriptions of the Spaniel were ridiculed by later publications.Because of the treacherous conditions in which this breed of dog was used, coupled with a succession of accidents, talk of the whole stock becoming extinct was raised as early as 1839. However at some point prior to 1847 a pestilence swept through the region and reduced the number down to a single specimen, which forced the canons into crossing it with other breeds.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== St. Bernard ===\nThe Alpine Spaniel was one of the direct genetic progenitors to the St. Bernard. Starting in 1830, the monks and canons of the Swiss Alps began crossing the dogs with the Newfoundland, expecting that the resulting offspring would have the longer hair of the Newfoundland and this would protect the dogs better from the cold. Unfortunately ice would form on the longer hair, and seeing that the dogs were no longer effective rescue dogs, the monasteries gave them away to people in the surrounding Swiss valleys.In 1855 a stud book was opened for these crosses, which supplied the hospice with suitable dogs and also exported the dogs overseas. Many people began breeding them indiscriminately, which resulted in their modern appearance. By 1868, the breed was commonly being referred to as the \"Saint Bernard Dog\" first and the Alpine Spaniel second.\n\n\n=== Clumber Spaniel ===\nIt is thought that the Clumber Spaniel originated in 18th century France from the Basset Hound and the Alpine Spaniel. The name \"Clumber\" itself comes from Clumber Park, Nottinghamshire.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Image of Barry, prior to being restored in 1923, with original head shape\".

Small farmers and ranchers used this all-around working dog for many tasks including farm guardians, stock dogs and catch dogs. These dogs were not an actual breed as considered by today's standards but were a generic bulldog type. There were no recorded pedigrees or records and breeding decisions were dependent on the best working farm dogs despite breed or background. Several separate strains of the \"bulldog\" type dogs were kept by ranchers as utilitarian working dogs.\nPerhaps the most important role of the bulldog and the reason for its survival, and in fact why it thrived throughout the South, was because of the presence of feral pigs, introduced to the New World and without predators. The bulldogs were the settlers' only means of sufficiently dealing with the vermin. \nBy World War II, the breed was near extinction until John D. Johnson scoured the back roads of the South looking for the best specimens to revive the breed. During this time a young Alan Scott grew an interest in Johnson's dogs and began to work with him on the revitalization process. At some point, Scott began infusing non-Johnson catch bulldogs from working Southern farms with Johnson's lines, creating what is now known as the Standard type American Bulldog, also called the Scott type. At another point, Johnson began crossing his original lines with an atavistic English bulldog from the North that had maintained its genetic athletic vigor, creating the Bully type American Bulldog, also known as the Johnson type of the Classic type.\nAmerican bulldogs are now safe from extinction and are enjoying a healthy increase in popularity, either as a working/protector dog or as a family pet. All over the world, they are used variously as \"hog dogs\" (catching escaped pigs or hunting razorbacks), as cattle drovers and as working or sport K-9s. American Bulldogs also successfully compete in several dog sports such as dog obedience, Schutzhund, French Ring, Mondio Ring, Iron Dog competition and weight pulling. They are also exhibited in conformation shows in the UKC, NKC, ABA, ABRA, EKC and the SACBR.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe American Bulldog is a stocky, well built, strong-looking dog, with a large head and a muscular build. Its coat is short and generally smooth. The breed is a light to moderate shedder. Colors, while historically predominantly white with patches of red, black, or brindle, have grown in recent years to include many color patterns including black, red, brown, fawn, and all shades of brindle. The color conformation is quite varied, but solid black or any degree of merle is considered a cosmetic fault, and a blue color is a disqualification by the NKC Breed Standard. Black pigmentation on the nose and eye rims is traditionally preferred, with only some pink allowed. Eye color is usually brown, but heterochromia also occurs, although this is also considered a cosmetic fault. American Bulldogs are known to drool more than other breeds of dog. The Bully type is generally a larger, heavier dog with a shorter muzzle. Standard types are generally more athletic with longer muzzles and a more square head. Many modern American Bulldogs are a combination of the two types, usually termed \"hybrid.\" In general, American Bulldogs weigh between 27 and 54 kg (60 to 120 lb) and are 52 to 70 cm (20 to 28 in) at the withers, but have been known to greatly exceed these dimensions, especially in the \"out of standard,\" nonworking stock.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nAmerican Bulldogs are typically confident, social, and active dogs that are at ease with their families. It is not uncommon for an American Bulldog to require a high level of attention due to their highly emotional personality. They bond strongly with their owners. They are capable of jumping in excess of 3 feet (0.91 m) vertical due to the dense muscle build of the breed. Young American Bulldogs may be slightly aloof with strangers, but as they mature the breed's normal confidence should assert itself. This breed tolerates children and can do very well with them, provided they are socialized early and understand their limits. The more exposure to good training practices, other dogs, and people, the more likely the success at being controlled both inside and outside of their environment. Early training and socialization both in the home and outside of the home is essential for this breed. While the goal of the breed was originally to produce a working farm utility dog that could catch and hold wild boar and cattle, kill vermin, and guard an owner's property, when properly trained, exercised and socialized, this breed can become a family pet.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nAmerican Bulldogs generally live from 10 to 16 years, and tend to be strong, physically active, and often healthy. Some health problems in American bulldogs are often found within certain genetic lines, and are not common to the entire breed, while others, such as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), Ichthyosis, disorders of the kidney and thyroid, ACL tears, hip dysplasia, cherry eye, elbow dysplasia, entropion, ectropion, and bone cancer are more common to the general population of American Bulldogs. There are DNA tests available to help breeders screen breeding animals for NCL (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) and Ichthyosis. A Penn Hip (Pennsylvania Hip Improvement project) or OFA (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals) screening is recommended for all potential breeding animals. Some American Bulldogs are prone to allergies.\n\n\n== American Bulldogs in popular culture ==\nSpike and Tyke from the Tom and Jerry franchise.\nThe Deftones' video Bloody Cape featured a model walking an American Bulldog down the street. The American Bulldog was actually played by two separate dogs from the Norcal's American Bulldog Kennel.

For example:\nChance from the feature film Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993) and its sequel, Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco (1996). Suregrips Rattler (Chance) was only in the first Homeward Bound movie.

It is a spaniel type dog that is closely related to the English Cocker Spaniel; the two breeds diverged during the 20th century due to differing breed standards in America and the UK. In the United States, the breed is usually called the Cocker Spaniel, while elsewhere in the world, it is called the American Cocker Spaniel in order to differentiate between it and its English cousin, which was already known as \"Cocker Spaniel\" before the American variety was created. The word cocker is commonly held to stem from their use to hunt woodcock in England, while spaniel is thought to be derived from the type's origins in Spain.\nThe first spaniel in America came across with the Mayflower in 1620, but it was not until 1878 that the first Cocker Spaniel was registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC). A national breed club was set up three years later and the dog considered to be the father of the modern breed, Ch. Obo II, was born around this time. By the 1920s the English and American varieties of Cocker had become noticeably different and in 1946 the AKC recognised the English type as a separate breed. It was not until 1970 that The Kennel Club in the UK recognised the American Cocker Spaniel as being separate from the English type. The American Cocker was the most popular breed in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s and again during the 1980s, reigning for a total of 18 years. They have also won the best in show title at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on four occasions, and have been linked to the President of the United States on several occasions, with owners including Richard Nixon and Harry S. Truman.  In 2013, the cocker spaniel ranked 29th the American Kennel Club registration statistics of historical comparisons and notable trends.\nThe breed is the smallest of the sporting dogs recognised by the AKC, and its distinctly shaped head makes it immediately recognisable. In addition, there are some marked differences between it and its English relative. It is a happy breed with average working intelligence, although by being bred to a show standard it is no longer an ideal working dog. Members of the breed suffer from a wide variety of health ailments including problems with their hearts, eyes and ears.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe word spanyell is thought to date from the late 12th century when it was used to name a type of dog imported into England from Spain, with the span part of the word referring to the country of origin. Records from the mid-14th century show that selective breeding was already in place, with the breed being separated into two distinct types, called water spaniels and land spaniels. By 1801, the smaller variety of land spaniel was called the Cocker or Cocking Spaniel, so named for its use in flushing woodcock.According to historical records, the first spaniel was brought to North America aboard the Mayflower which sailed from Plymouth, England and landed in New England in 1620. The first Cocker Spaniel recorded in America was a liver and white dog named Captain, who was registered with the American Kennel Club in 1878. In 1881, the American Cocker Spaniel Club was formed; it would later become the American Spaniel Club (ASC) and is now known as the oldest breed club for dogs in the United States. The task of the club was initially to create a standard to separate the Cocker Spaniel in America from other types of land spaniels, a task which would take over 20 years, only being completed in 1905.The dog considered to be the father of the American Cocker Spaniel was sired by the dog considered to be the father of the English Cocker Spaniel. Ch. Obo was bred to Ch. Chloe II, who was shipped to America while she was pregnant. Once in the United States, she whelped a dog who became Ch. Obo II. He differed greatly from the modern breed, being only 10 inches (25 cm) tall and with a long body, but was considered to be an excellent dog of that era and became a popular sire.Towards the end of the 19th century, the breed had become popular in America and Canada due to their dual use as a family pet and a working dog. In the early 20th century the breeders on either side of the Atlantic had created different breed standards for the Cocker Spaniel and the breed gradually diverged from one another, with the two becoming noticeably different by the 1920s. The American Cockers by now had a smaller muzzle, their coats were softer and the dogs overall were lighter and smaller. The differences were so apparent that in 1935, breeders founded the English Cocker Spaniel Club and restricted breeding between the two types of spaniel. The two types of Cocker Spaniel in America were shown together as one breed, with the English type as a variety of the main breed, until 1946 when the American Kennel Club recognised the English Cocker Spaniel as a separate breed.\n\n\n=== Return to the UK ===\n\nInitially in the United Kingdom there were a few American Cockers that had accompanied service personnel to American bases in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, several came over with embassy staff and business people returning home.The first UK Kennel Club registered American Cocker Spaniel was Aramingo Argonaught, born 17 January 1956 and bred by Herbert L. Steinberg. Two judges confirmed that the dog was an American Cocker and not an English Cocker before the Kennel Club permitted the dog to be shown. In the 1960s they were shown as a rare breed, which meant that they did not have a show class of their own and could only be shown in variety classes. This included Aramingo Argonaught, who was the first American Cocker Spaniel to be shown at Crufts in 1960 in a class entitled \"Any variety not classified at this show\". In 1968, the KC agreed to have the breed shown in the category \"Any variety gundog other than Cocker\" and stated that the American Cocker was not a variety of \"Spaniel (Cocker)\". There were around 100 registrations between 1966 and 1968.In 1970 the breed was given a separate register in the Kennel Club Breed Supplement, as it was previously included in \"Any other variety\". Registration numbers increased to 309 by 1970 following this full recognition.\n\n\n=== Notable American Cockers and popularity ===\n\nAmerican Cocker Spaniels have won best in show at the Westminster Dog Show on four occasions, with the first win in 1921 by Ch. Midkiff Seductive. Ch. My Own Brucie won the title twice in 1940 and 1941, and became known as the most photographed dog in the world.Brucie's win in 1940 coincided with the American Cocker Spaniel becoming the most popular breed of dog in the United States, and they would remain the most popular until 1952. The most recent victory was in 1954 with the victory going to Ch. Carmor's Rise and Shine. The popularity of the American Cocker increased once again in the 1980s with it becoming the most popular breed again from 1984 until 1990. In more recent years the popularity of the breed has decreased, with it ranked 15th most popular by the American Kennel Club in 2005.American Cocker Spaniels have had several links to the United States Presidency. In 1952, an American Cocker Spaniel became a household name when United States Senator Richard Nixon made his Checkers speech on 23 September. A parti-colored American Cocker Spaniel named Dot was one of several dogs owned by Rutherford B. Hayes; and a buff colored dog named Feller caused a scandal for Harry S. Truman when the dog was received as an unwanted gift with the President subsequently giving it away to a White House physician. More recently, a Cocker named Zeke lived with Bill Clinton while he was Arkansas Governor.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe American Cocker Spaniel is the smallest dog recognised by the American Kennel Club as a sporting dog, being on average between 13.5 and 15.5 inches (34 and 39 cm) high at the withers. It is a dog of normal proportions, with medium long silky fur on the body and ears, hanging down on the legs and belly (known as feathering). The head has an upturned nose and the ears hang down. The breed standard states that size over 15.5 inches (39 cm) inches for males and 14.5 inches (37 cm) for females is a disqualification at conformation shows. American Cocker Spaniels weigh around 24 to 30 pounds (11 to 14 kg) on average, with females of the breed usually weighing slightly less than the males.The head of an American Cocker Spaniel makes the breed immediately recognizable, with the rounded dome of the skull, well-pronounced stop, and a square shaped lip. The drop ears are long, low set, with long silky fur, and the eyes are dark, large, and rounded. The nose can be black or brown depending on the colour of the breed.The coat of the breed come in a variety of shades with the colours being separated into three main groups: black/black and tan, any solid colour other than black (ASCOB), and parti-colour. The black variety is either all black, or with tan points on the dog's head, the feet and the tail in a pattern called black and tan. The group known as ASCOB includes all other solid colours from light cream through to dark red, although some lighter colouring is allowed on the feathering according to standards. Parti-coloured dogs are white with patches of another colour such as black or brown, and includes any roan coloured dogs. In addition, American Cockers coats can come in a pattern known as merle, which is not recognised by the American Kennel Club.American Cockers have rounder eyes, a domed skull, shorter muzzle and more clearly pronounced eyebrows than the English Cockers, whose head is more setter-like. In colours, the roan colours are rarer in the American variety than in the English but the shade of buff which is common in the American is not seen in the English breed at all, although there are English Cocker Spaniels which are considered to be a shade of red. The English breed is also slightly larger, being between 14.5\u201315.5 inches (37\u201339 cm) in height.\nAmerican Cocker Spaniel\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nKnown as the \"Merry Cocker\", the American Cocker Spaniel breed standard defines the ideal dog of the breed as being \"equable in temperament with no suggestion of timidity.\" The breed ranks 20th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, a rating that indicates good \"Working or Obedience Intelligence\", or trainability. IQ tests run on a variety of breeds in the 1950s and 1960s showed that the American Cocker performed the best when tested on its ability to show restraint and delayed response to a trigger, a trait which was put down to the breed's bred-in ability when hunting to freeze upon finding a bird before flushing it out on command. However, they proved to be the worst breed tested when it came to manipulating objects with their paws, for instance uncovering a dish of food or pulling on a string.With a good level of socialisation at an early age, an American Cocker can get along with people, children, other dogs and other pets. This breed seems to have a perpetually wagging tail and prefers to be around people; it is not best suited to the backyard alone. Cockers can be easily stressed by loud noises and by rough treatment or handling.Members of the breed were originally used as hunting dogs, but increased in popularity as a show dog. It was bred more and more in conformation with the breed standard, resulting in certain attributes, such as a long coat, which no longer make it an ideal working dog.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nAmerican Cocker Spaniels in UK and USA/Canada surveys had a median lifespan of about 10 to 11 years, which is on the low end of the typical range for purebred dogs, and one to two years less than other breeds of their size. The larger English Cocker Spaniel typically lives about a year longer than the American Cocker Spaniel. In a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (23%), old age (20%), cardiac (8%), and immune-mediated (8%). In a 2003 USA/Canada Health Survey with a smaller sample size, the leading causes of death were cancer, hepatic disease, and immune-mediated.American Cockers previously high popularity resulted in the breed frequently being bred by backyard breeders or in puppy mills. This indiscriminate breeding has increased the proliferation of breed related health issues in certain bloodlines.American Cocker Spaniels are susceptible to a variety of illnesses, particularly infections affecting their ears and, in some cases, their eyes. Although the number or percent of afflicted dogs is not known, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), glaucoma, and cataracts have been identified in some members of the breed. The American Spaniel Club recommends annual eye exams by a veterinary ophthalmologist for all dogs that are to be used for breeding. Autoimmune problems in Cockers have also been identified in an unknown number or percent of the breed, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Ear inflammations are common in drop-eared breeds of dog, including the American Cocker, and luxating patellas and hip dysplasia have been identified in some members of the breed.Heart conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy, where the heart becomes weakened and enlarged, and sick sinus syndrome, which is a type of abnormal heart beating which causes low blood pressure, have been identified in the breed. Phosphofructokinase deficiency is a condition caused by a recessive gene in the breed which prevents the metabolism of glucose into energy, causing the dog to have extremely low energy and be unable to exercise. The gene which causes this appears in around 10 percent of the population, but DNA testing can prevent two carrier dogs from breeding and thus creating puppies with this condition.American Cockers are also prone to canine epilepsy and the related condition known as Rage Syndrome. The latter is a form of epilepsy which can cause a normally placid dog to engage in sudden and unprovoked violent attacks. Initial research shows that both conditions appear to be inheritable.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe film Lady and the Tramp features Lady who is an American Cocker Spaniel.\n\n\n== References ==\nSpecific\nGeneral\n\n\n== External links ==\nAmerican Cocker Spaniel at Curlie"}, {"id": 19, "name": "American English Coonhound", "country": "United States", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog19", "description": "The English Coonhound, also referred to as the American English Coonhound (by the American Kennel Club only) or the Redtick Coonhound, is a breed of coonhound that originated in and is typically bred in the Southern United States. It is descended from hunting hounds, especially Foxhounds, brought to America by settlers during the 17th and 18th centuries. The breed's first recognition came from the United Kennel Club in 1905 as the English Fox and Coonhound. Further recognition has been granted in recent years by the American Kennel Club, first in the Foundation Stock Service and in 2011 as a fully recognized member of the hound group.\nThe breed is of medium height and proportionate weight, and their coats come predominantly in three types: redtick, bluetick, and a tricolor tick pattern. The English Coonhound has a high prey drive and, while it is typically used in 'coon hunting', it is also skilled in treeing. This breed is generally a healthy one, but it is recommended that prospective owners learn to recognize symptoms of bloat, as its large size and deep chest put them at risk of this condition.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe breed's ancestry can be traced back to Foxhounds brought to the United States by European settlers during the 17th and 18th centuries. It shares a common ancestry with all other coonhounds, with the exception of the Plott Hound. The breed developed from 'Virginia Hounds', which were developed over time from dogs imported to the United States by Robert Brooke, Thomas Walker and the first President of the United States, George Washington. The terrain here was much rougher than what they were used to, so the breed was specifically bred over time to better adapt to these new conditions. It was traditionally used to hunt raccoons by night and the American red fox by day. The United Kennel Club (UKC) first recognized it in 1905 as the English Fox and Coonhound.The Treeing Walker Coonhound was recognized separately by the UKC in 1945, separating it from the English Fox and Coonhound breed. The following year, the Bluetick Coonhound was also split into an entirely different breed.The English Coonhound was accepted into the American Kennel Club's Foundation Stock Service as the American English Coonhound in 1995. On 1 January, 2010, it was moved up to the Miscellaneous Class. Following the recognition of the breed by the AKC in the hound group on 30 June 2011 as the 171st breed, the American English Coonhound became eligible to compete in the National Dog Show in 2011, followed by its eligibility for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show and the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship for the first time in 2012.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nMale English Coonhounds measure between 22\u201327 inches (56\u201369 cm) at the withers, with females being slightly smaller at 21\u201325 inches (53\u201364 cm). The weight of a Coonhound should be in proportion to the dog's height.Unlike the other breeds of coonhounds, a variety of colorations is acceptable to meet English Coonhound breed standards. Coloration can be redtick, bluetick, tricolored and tricolored with ticking. However, red markings are predominant and \"Redtick\" is a common euphemism for English Coonhounds. Some believe this lack of emphasis on specific coloration has allowed breeders to focus breeding programs on traits such as intelligence and hunting ability rather than superficial concerns like coat standards. Color variations are common even among pups from the same litter of English Coonhounds, indicating high levels of DNA diversity in the breed. The coat is short and coarse.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nEnglish Coonhounds require regular exercise to keep in prime condition, but are generally mellow when not on the prey's tail. English Coonhounds usually make good house pets. However, they have a high prey drive and will go after small animals unless time is taken to train them otherwise. Because of this, they are not usually recommended for households with small pets unless they have been raised around small animals. They are generally good with children and tend to be very loyal dogs that are eager to please their owners. Like most puppies, younger English Coonhounds can be quite inquisitive and destructive- therefore, obedience training early on is highly recommended, as is providing them with plenty of attention and exercise. As they are known to bark when caged, crate training from a young age is strongly recommended, as well.\nLike all coonhounds, English are generally good natured and very sociable dogs. Skittishness or aggression is considered a defect, according to UKC breed standards. They are strong-willed, if not downright stubborn, and require more patience in training than other breeds. English Coonhounds are incessant nesters and should be avoided by people who do not wish to have dogs on their furniture. They make excellent family pets, as they have been bred to coexist amiably within a pack, as well as to be efficient hunters. English Coonhounds also make adequate watch dogs, as their vocalizations are characterized by melodious, drawn out bawls and short, explosive chops typical of Hound type dogs.\n\n\n=== Hunting ===\nThe breed has proven popular with coon hunters and has a powerful nose which enables it to track both small and large game, including raccoons, cougars and bears. One of the types of hunting that the breed is used for treeing, where the dogs are used to force climbing animals up into trees, where they can be cornered and shot by hunters.While known for their ability in this type of hunting, they can lose their ability to pace themselves and, on occasion, stand their ground when they believe that they have chased their prey up a tree, even if they haven't. They can have a one track mind while hunting and tune everything else out, including commands. Against cougars and bears, they can keep the larger game in position until the hunters arrive. They have become a favored breed in coon hunting.\n\n\n== Health ==\nEnglish Coonhounds can be prone to overheating while on coon hunts during the summer months in the Southern United States. Breeders who specialize in this breed screen their potential pairs for hip and elbow dysplasia, as well as any eye disorders. Like any other floppy-eared dog breed, the English Coonhound should have its ears checked frequently to ensure minimal wax and debris buildup. Owners should also learn the symptoms of bloat, as their large size and deep chest makes them susceptible to this life-threatening disease.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links =="}, {"id": 20, "name": "American Eskimo Dog", "country": "Germany", "type": "Northern Breed", "picture": "dog20", "description": "The American Eskimo Dog is a breed of companion dog, originating in Germany. The American Eskimo is a member of the Spitz family. The breed's progenitors were German Spitz, but due to anti-German sentiment during the First World War, it was renamed \"American Eskimo Dog\". Although modern American Eskimos have been exported as German Spitz Gross (or Mittel, depending on the dog's height), the breeds have diverged and the standards are significantly different. In addition to serving as a watchdog and companion, the American Eskimo Dog also achieved a high degree of popularity in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s as a circus performer.\nThere are three size varieties of the American Eskimo breed, the toy, the miniature and the standard. They share a common resemblance with Japanese Spitz, Danish Spitz, Volpino Italiano, German Spitz and Samoyed.\n\n\n== History ==\n  The American Eskimo Dog was originally bred to guard people and property and, therefore, is territorial by nature and a valiant watchdog. It is not considered an aggressive breed but, due to its watchdog history, American Eskimo dogs are generally quite vocal, barking at any stranger who comes in proximity to their owners' territory.\nIn Northern Europe, smaller Spitz were eventually developed into the various German Spitz breeds. European immigrants brought their Spitz pets with them to the United States, especially New York, in the early 1900s, \"all of them descended from the larger German Spitz, the Keeshond, the white Pomeranian, and the Italian Spitz, the Volpino Italiano.\"Although white was not always a recognized color in the various German Spitz breeds, it was generally the preferred color in the US. In a display of patriotism in the era around World War I, dog owners began referring to their pets as American Spitz rather than German Spitz.After World War I, the small Spitz dogs came to the attention of the American public when the dogs became popular entertainers in the American circus. In 1917, the Cooper Brothers\u2019 Railroad Circus featured the dogs. A dog named Stout's Pal Pierre was famous for walking a tightrope with the Barnum and Bailey Circus in the 1930s, and also contributing to their popularity, they sold puppies after the show. Due to the popularity of the circus dogs, many of today's American Eskimo Dogs can trace their lineage back to these circus dogs.\n\nAfter World War II, the dogs continued to be popular pets. Postwar contact with Japan led to importation into the United States of the Japanese Spitz, which may have been crossed into the breed at this time. The breed was first officially recognized as the \"American Eskimo\" as early as 1919 by the American United Kennel Club (UKC), and the first written record and history of the breed was printed in 1958 by the UKC. At that time there was no official breed club and no breed standard, and dogs were accepted for registration as single dogs, based on appearance. In 1970 the National American Eskimo Dog Association (NAEDA) was founded, and single dog registrations ceased. In 1985 the American Eskimo Dog Club of America (AEDCA) was formed by fanciers who wished to register the breed with the American Kennel Club (AKC). Following the AKC's requirements for breed recognition, the AEDCA collected the pedigree information from 1,750 dogs that now form the basis of the AKC recognized breed, which is called the American Eskimo Dog. The breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1995. The stud book was opened from 2000 to 2003 in an attempt to register more of the original UKC registered lines, and today many American Eskimo Dogs are dual-registered with both American kennel clubs. The breed is also recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club as of 2006, but is not recognized elsewhere in the world\nThe American Eskimo Dog is not entirely an internationally recognized breed, and since neither of the American kennel clubs are affiliated with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, fanciers wishing to participate in certain international dog shows will register their American Eskimo Dogs as the very similar German Spitz. This is done only by individuals wishing to participate in dog sports in international shows, and does not mean that the American Eskimo Dog and the German Spitz are the same. Although the American Eskimo is known as the German Spitz in several countries outside of the United States, the two breeds have actually developed somewhat differently since the American Eskimo was relocated to North America, over a century ago. It is not uncommon for German Spitz breeders to incorporate imported American Eskimo bloodlines into their breeding program to broaden the gene pool, and vice versa.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe American Eskimo is a hardy breed with an average life span of 12\u201315 years. This breed tends to become overweight easily, so proper diet and exercise is needed to maintain an overall well being. Health testing should be performed by all responsible breeders and anyone purchasing a puppy should be aware of the genetic problems which have been found in some individuals of the breed, such as PRA (Progressive Retinal Atrophy), luxating patella, and hip dysplasia. None of these problems are common and the breed is generally very healthy. In addition to the rarer problems mentioned, the breed can have a tendency towards allergies and most commonly, tear-staining. This breed also is known in some cases to have dental issues.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe American Eskimo is an affectionate, loving dog. The breed is easy to train and they are excellent with children because of the dog's high intelligence and its willingness to please.  American Eskimos often rank among the top scorers in obedience trials. They like to work. Naturally wary of strangers, once properly introduced, they become friends. American Eskimos are highly intelligent, inquisitive and love to investigate. Without enough mental and physical exercise, they can become hyperactive and high-strung, spinning in circles. They are not always recommended for first-time dog owners, but with some advice from a trainer, can be a great pet.\nThe American Kennel Club standard states:\n\nThe American Eskimo Dog is intelligent, alert, and friendly, although slightly conservative. It is never overly shy nor aggressive, and such dogs are to be severely penalized in the show ring. At home it is an excellent  watchdog, sounding a warning bark to announce the arrival of any stranger. It is protective of its home and family, although it does not threaten to bite or attack people. The American Eskimo Dog learns new tasks quickly and is eager to please.\n\n\n== Sizes ==\nAmerican Eskimo Dogs come in three size varieties:Toy: 9\u201312 inches and 6\u201310 lbs / 22\u201330 cm and 3\u20135 kg\nMiniature: 12\u201315 inches and 10\u201317 lbs / 30\u201340 cm and 5\u20138 kg\nStandard: 15\u201320 inches and 18\u201335 lbs / 40\u201350 cm and 8\u201316 kg\nAlthough weight is not specified by the breed standard, toy dogs usually range from 6-11 lbs, miniature dogs from 10-21 lbs, and standard-sized dogs from 19-40 lbs. Some overlap in weight ranges occurs because the size category that an American Eskimo Dog falls into is set by its height at the withers, and not its weight.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBreed club (dog)\nCanadian Eskimo Dog\nGerman Spitz\nDanish Spitz\nVolpino Italiano\nNorthern Breed Group\nSpitz\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAmerican Eskimo Dog at Curlie"}, {"id": 21, "name": "American Foxhound", "country": "United States", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog21", "description": "The American Foxhound is a breed of dog that is a cousin of the English Foxhound. They are scent hounds, bred to hunt foxes by scent.\n\n\n== History ==\n In 1650, Robert Brooke sailed from England to Crown Colony in North America with his pack of hunting dogs, which were the root of several strains of American Hounds. Dogs of this bloodline remained in the Brooke family for nearly 300 years. George Washington received French Foxhounds, Grand Bleu de Gascogne, (which look much like an American Bluetick Coonhound) as a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette. Many of the dogs Washington kept were descended from Brooke's, and when crossed with the French hounds, helped to create the present day American Foxhound. The American Foxhound is known to have originated in the states of Maryland and Virginia, and is the state dog of Virginia. Though there has long been a rumor that the new breed was originally used for hunting Indigenous peoples of the Americas, this is not true. The breed was developed by landed gentry purely for the sport of hunting foxes. With the importation (or migration) of the red fox, Irish Foxhounds were added to the lines, to increase speed and stamina in the dog, qualities still prevalent in today's dogs. One quality that the American Foxhound is famous for is its musical bay that can be heard for miles. This is actually one reason why this breed does not do well in city settings. The breed was first recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1886. Today, there are many different strains of American Foxhound, including Walker, Calhoun, Goodman, Trigg, July and Penn-Marydel. Though each strain looks different, they are all recognized as members of the same breed. Most show hounds are Walkers, many of the pack hounds (used with hunting foxes on horseback) are Penn-Marydel and hunters use a variety of strains to suit their hunting style and quarry.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nWhile standards call for the American Foxhound to be about 21\u201325 in (53\u201364 cm) tall to the withers, and weigh anywhere between 55\u201371 lb (25\u201332 kg), many of them are larger in structure (especially the show strains), with males standing 26\u201329 in (66\u201374 cm) and females 25\u201328 in (64\u201371 cm) and smaller in weight, typically between 45\u201365 lb (20\u201329 kg). The legs of a Foxhound are long and straight-boned. The foxhound's chest is rather narrow. It has a long muzzle, and a large, domed skull. The ears are wide and low-set. The eyes are hazel or brown, and are large and wide-set.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nA close, hard hound coat of medium length, and any color, though the combination of black, white and tan is prevalent.  American Foxhounds do tend to shed a good amount of hair, but a weekly brushing will decrease shedding. \n\n\n=== Defining physical characteristics ===\nThe American Foxhound is taller and rangier than its cousin, the English Foxhound. Also, this breed is known to have a musical bark, called a bay, when it is hunting that can be heard for miles, probably inherited from the Grand Bleu de Gascogne's signature howl. If competing in a dog show, some physical characteristics that judges would look for would be a slightly domed skull, long, large ears, large eyes, straight muzzle, well laid-back shoulders, a moderately long back, fox-like feet, and a slightly curved tail. Though they are traditionally tri-colored (black, white and tan) they can be any color. They are one of the rarest breeds in the American Kennel Club.\n\n\n== Behavior ==\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe American Foxhound has a very docile and sweet demeanor. A typical dog is gentle, easygoing, and gets along with children and other animals. However, they may act shy and reserved when around strangers.\n\n\n=== Activity level ===\nThe American Foxhound is a very active breed and very high energy. They require a lot of exercise and do best in habitats where they have room to run. If they live in a suburban area such as a neighborhood, they should have a fenced in yard and be taken on multiple walks daily.\n\n\n=== Trainability ===\nObedience training is essential for this breed due to their independence and natural instinct to follow a scent. A Foxhound who picks up a scent will follow it while ignoring commands; training requires patience and skill because of the breed's independence and occasional stubbornness. Because of its strong hunting instinct, American Foxhounds should not be trusted off-leash. Most scent hounds are bred to give \"voice,\" but the Foxhound does not make a good watchdog.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThis breed is not generally a breed that carries genetic disorders. However they can easily become overweight when overfed. A minor health risk in American Foxhounds is thrombocytopathy, or platelet disease. This comes from poorly functioning blood platelets and can result in excessive bleeding from minor bumps or cuts. The treatment is usually based on the severity of the disease. Owners will often have their American Foxhounds undergo blood tests so that the condition can be caught early on. While dysplasia was largely unknown in Foxhounds, it is beginning to crop up occasionally, along with some eye issues. It is not typical or customary for Foxhound breeders to screen for any hereditary disorders at this time. The breed's lifespan is generally 10\u201312 years. The American Foxhound is an energetic breed. According to some veterinarians and trainers, it needs plenty of exercise, for example, a fairly long walk followed by a game of fetch.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEnglish Foxhound\nTrigg Hound\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"July\" 1858 The Original July Foxhound historical marker"}, {"id": 22, "name": "American Hairless Terrier", "country": "United States", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog22", "description": "The American Hairless Terrier is a rare breed of dog that was derived as a variant of Rat Terrier. As of January 1, 2004, the United Kennel Club deemed the AHT a separate terrier breed, granting it full UKC recognition. An intelligent, social and energetic working breed, the American Hairless Terrier is often listed as a potential good breed choice for allergy sufferers.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe American Hairless Terrier's American ancestry begins with the mixed breed terriers called Feists brought from Europe to North America as early as the 18th century.  In the late 1800s the Rat Terrier breed was developed from the Feist by the addition of \nBeagle, Italian Greyhound and Miniature Pinscher bloodlines.\nThe distinct American Hairless Terrier breed began in 1972 when one hairless puppy named Josephine appeared in a Rat Terrier litter in the state of Louisiana, United States. Owners Edwin and Willie Scott liked the dog's look and temperament, and upon maturity bred her hoping to reproduce the hairless quality. They were eventually successful; a litter produced in 1981 provided the foundation stock of the breed.\n\n\n=== Breed recognition ===\nIn 1998, the breed gained recognition as the American Hairless Terrier (AHT) by the American Rare Breeds Association and the National Rat Terrier Club. Canada was the first country outside the US to gain recognition, by Canadian Rarities in 1999. In 1999, the breed was recognized as Rat Terrier, Hairless Variety by the United Kennel Club.\nIn the US, the American Hairless Terrier Association is the official breed club for the American Kennel Club. Other national breed clubs around the world include the Canadian American Hairless Terrier Association and the Japanese Hairless American Terrier Club.\nOn January 1, 2004, the United Kennel Club (UKC) recognized the AHT as a distinct breed.Despite its smaller size, the AHT is not a toy breed.  Rather, like its Rat Terrier cousin, the AHT is a working breed.\nIn January 2016 the American Hairless Terrier was recognized fully by the AKC in the terrier group.\n\n\n== Coated American Hairless Terrier ==\nIn its 2006 description, the UKC continued to recognize the hairless and coated  varieties of the American Hairless Terrier noting that \"[w]hile it may seem contradictory to have coated dogs in a hairless breed, it will be necessary for the foreseeable future to continue to include some Rat Terrier crosses until there are sufficient hairless dogs to maintain a separate and healthy gene pool\".\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe American Hairless Terrier is a smoothly muscled, active, small-to-medium terrier.\nHeight: 7-18 inches (18\u201345.7 cm.)Life Span: 14\u201316 years.\nWeight: 7-25 pounds (2.5\u201312 kg.)Skin Color:  White (to varying degrees) with a variety of colors including black, blue, pink, brown, tan, and sable.  Skin color darkens with sunEye Color: Brown, blue, grey, amber and turquoisePattern:  near-solid (with some white), brindled, spotted (piebald) and saddledTail/Ears:  Tails must be left long on the hairless variety, coateds may be docked or left undockedType:  Working Breed\n\n\n=== American Hairless Terrier and Rat Terrier distinctions ===\nThe American Hairless Terrier's origins are unique in that the entire breed originated from a single hairless Rat Terrier female born in 1972. The AHT is therefore very similar to the Rat Terrier and the coated AHT is almost indistinguishable from its Rat Terrier cousin.\nHowever, since the first litter born in 1982 from the originating hairless female, the AHT has continued to be developed as a distinct breed (see \"Breed Recognition\") with several characteristics that distinguish the AHT from its Rat Terrier origins. These differences include smaller sizes, more refined features, new eye colors, new patterns, new (skin) colors and, of course, a complete lack of fur on the hairless variety.\nOther breeder choices have further differentiated the AHT. AHT breeders and clubs promote the undocked tail appearance on hairless, unlike the more traditionally docked appearance of the Rat Terrier. To date, the hairless trait has not been bred over to the other types of Rat Terrier such as the Decker Giant Terrier or the Type B Rat Terrier (also known as the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier).\n\n\n== Hairless breeds and genetics ==\nWhile there are unproven theories that other hairless dog breeds have common ancestry, the recent evolution of the American Hairless Terrier demonstrates an independent evolution from other hairless breeds.\nA key difference found between the American Hairless Terrier and other Hairless Dog breeds is that the AHT's hairless gene is recessive, while the gene for hairlessness found in the ancient breeds is a lethal dominant.\nThe American Hairless Terrier does not have dental issues (absent premolars) or other characteristics associated with the dominant hairless gene.\nFor dogs where hairlessness is a dominant gene, hairless to hairless matings will on average produce 66.6% hairless and 33.3% coated live puppies. For hairless to coated matings, there will be an average one-to-one ratio between coated and hairless offspring. In coated to coated matings, all puppies will be coated.\nMatings between hairless AHTs will produce completely hairless litters. Between hairless AHT to coated AHT or Rat Terrier, results are more variable and will produce mixed hairless litters to all coated litters.\n\n\n== Hypoallergenic dog breed ==\nThere is no scientific evidence supporting the existence of a completely\nhypoallergenic dog breed and hairlessness is not the sole characteristic that will determine allergic reactions or its degree.\nThe American Hairless Terrier Association recommends individual allergy tests prior to adopting an AHT.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe American Hairless Terrier (AHT) is an intelligent, curious, and energetic breed.\nGraceful and elegant, the American Hairless Terrier is also strong and athletic. The AHT enjoys participating in agility games like its other terrier cousins. The AHT typically likes to dig, chase small game and will bark when alarmed and will act as a good watch dog. The AHT is not a strong swimmer and should be monitored around water.\nIts ancestry gives the AHT a strong hunting instinct, but its lack of coat makes it a less likely candidate for a hunting dog as rough underbrush may hurt the AHT's unprotected skin. As a breed founded by working dogs, the prey drive is strong in many AHTs. This has led to debate among owners as to whether or not AHTs are appropriate for families with young children. Anecdotal evidence suggests that AHT's can be trained to be less aggressive to children, especially if the dog is shown  that it may not dominate a child. Due to the small size of many AHTs, they can be hurt if roughly handled. Positive reward is the most effective form of training, however, some AHT require a more care-giver dominant approach to correction in giving the AHT direction.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe American Hairless Terrier continues to be a rare breed with a limited breeding stock. The UKC recognizes the need to continue to breed in Rat Terrier blood lines (see \"Coated American Hairless Terrier\") until \"breed of breeds\" (also, see \"Genetics\" above).\nAlthough often stated otherwise, AHTs do not have sweat glands. However, after physical exertion or in warm temperatures, the breed exhibits dermal evidence of moisture along the spine, typically lower spine.  There is no scientific evidence to suggest an independent evolution of sweat glands unique to this breed. The mis-perception has likely arisen from the presence of sebaceous glands associated with hair follicles. These are the same glands that are present in all canines. The hairless variety of this breed has the same follicles, however the \"hair\" is lost early on as the dog matures.\nRashes due to grass allergies are not entirely uncommon. Other allergies may occur as well, but this is no different from most other breeds of dogs. Due to their lack of hair, they may need protection from the sun (based on the season, their geographic location and the individual dog's degree of pigmentation or lack thereof). If needed, sunscreen can be applied or a light shirt may be worn. Clothing is oftentimes used, not only for the protection from the sun but from the cold as well (where the climate warrants). It is, however, important to keep the skin clean with regular, possibly daily depending on application of sunscreen or moisturizers, bathing with gentle soap to prevent infections in the skin pores (acne).\n\n\n== See also ==\nRare breeds\nFeists\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nClubs, Associations, and Societies\nAmerican Hairless Terrier Association - Provisional National UKC Parent Club\nHurricane Alley American Hairless Terrier Association\nCanadian American Hairless Terrier Association\nAmerican Hairless Terrier Club of America"}, {"id": 23, "name": "American Pit Bull Terrier", "country": "United States", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog23", "description": "The American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) is a purebred dog breed recognized by the United Kennel Club and American Dog Breeders Association. It is a medium-sized, solidly-built, intelligent, short-haired dog, whose early ancestors came from the British Isles. When compared with the English Staffordshire Bull Terrier (another breed within the type commonly called pit bulls), the American Pit Bull Terrier is larger by margins of 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) in height and 25\u201335 pounds (11\u201316 kg) in weight. The American Pit Bull Terrier varies in size. Males normally are about 18-21 inches (45\u201353 cm) in height and around 35-60 pounds (15\u201327 kg) in weight. Females are normally around 17-20 inches (43\u201350 cm) in height and 30-50 pounds (13\u201322 kg) in weight.The American Pit Bull is medium-sized and has a short coat and smooth well-defined muscle structure. Its eyes are round to almond-shaped, and its ears are small to medium in length, typically half prick or rose in carriage.  The tail is slightly thick and tapers to a point. The coat is glossy, smooth, short, and stiff to the touch. Any color, color pattern, or combination of colors is acceptable, both the ADBA and UKC do not recognize merle coloring. Color patterns that are typical in the breed are solid and tuxedo.\nDespite the legal status of the term \"pit bull\" and its popular concept, some conservative professional breeders of the American Pit Bull Terrier as well as some experts and supporters claim that historically the APBT is the only true \"pit bull\" and the only breed that would be denominated as such.Twelve countries in Europe, as well as Australia, Canada, Ecuador, Malaysia, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, and Venezuela,  have enacted some form of breed-specific legislation on pit bull-type dogs, including American Pit Bull Terriers, ranging from outright bans to restrictions and conditions on ownership.  The state of New South Wales in Australia places restrictions on the breed, including mandatory sterilization. The breed is banned in the United Kingdom, in the Canadian province of Ontario, and in many locations in the United States.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nUntil the mid-19th century the now extinct Old English Terriers and Old English Bulldogs were bred together to produce a dog that combined the gameness of the terrier with the strength and athleticism of the bulldog. These dogs named Bull and Terriers were bred in the British Isles, and arrived in the United States in the late nineteenth century where they became the direct ancestors of the American Pit Bull Terrier. In the United Kingdom, Bull-and-terriers were used in bloodsports such as bull baiting and bear baiting. These bloodsports were officially eliminated in 1835 when Britain introduced animal welfare laws. Since dogfights are cheaper to organize and far easier to conceal from the law than bull or bear baits, bloodsport proponents turned to pitting their dogs against each other instead. Dog fighting was used as both a bloodsport (often involving gambling) and a way to continue to test the quality of their stock. For decades afterwards, dog fighting clandestinely took place in small areas of Britain and America. In the early 20th century, pit bulls were used as catch dogs in America for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt, and drive livestock, and as family companions. Some have been selectively bred for their fighting prowess.Pit Bull Terriers successfully fill the role of companion dogs, and police dogs, and therapy dog. Pit Bull Terriers also constitute the majority of dogs used for illegal dog fighting in America In addition, law enforcement organizations report these dogs are used for other nefarious purposes, such as guarding illegal narcotics operations, use against police, and as attack dogs.In an effort to counter the fighting reputation of pit bull-type dogs, in 1996 the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals renamed pit bull terriers \"St. Francis Terriers\", hoping that people would be more likely to adopt them. 60 temperament-screened dogs were adopted until the program was halted, after several of the newly adopted pit bulls killed cats. The New York City Center for Animal Care and Control tried a similar approach in 2004, relabeling their pit bulls as \"New Yorkies\", but dropped the idea in the face of overwhelming public opposition.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe UKC gives this description of the characteristics of the American Pit Bull Terrier:\n\nThe essential characteristics of the American Pit Bull Terrier are strength, confidence, and zest for life. This breed is eager to please and brimming over with enthusiasm. APBTs make good family companions and have always been noted for their love of children. Because most APBTs exhibit some level of dog aggression and because of its powerful physique, the APBT requires an owner who will carefully socialize and obedience train the dog. The breed\u2019s natural agility makes it one of the most capable canine climbers so good fencing is a must for this breed. The APBT is not the best choice for a guard dog since they are extremely friendly, especially with strangers. Aggressive behavior toward humans is uncharacteristic of the breed and highly undesirable. This breed does very well in performance events because of its high level of intelligence and its willingness to work, especially in ratting pits.\n\nThe standard imposed by the ADBA and OFRNR (Old Family Red Nose Registry) considers the human aggression a disqualification factor.\nThe APDR (American Preservation Dog Registry) standard points out that \"the temperament MUST be totally reliable with people\".The ATTS (American Temperament Test Society) conducts temperament testing since 1977 with several dog breeds, and as of July 2018 has tested more than 900 APBTs. According to the tests conducted by ATTS, the APBTs has an 87.4% pass rate. This compares to a pass rate 85.6% for the Golden Retriever, which is one of America\u2019s most popular dog breeds.   However, the ATTS website does have a disclaimer: \u201cThe data presented on our web site is raw data; it is not a scientific study nor is there any statistical significance attached. We have no control over who brings their dog to the test and there is no accurate data as to a dog breed\u2019s population in the US.\u201dIn September 2000, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a study that examined dog-bite\u2013related fatalities (human death caused by dog-bite injuries) in order to \"summarize breeds of dogs involved in fatal human attacks during a 20-year period and to assess policy implications.\" The study examined 238 fatalities between 1979 and 1998 in which the breed of dog was known. It found that \"the data indicates that Rottweilers and pit bull-type dogs accounted for 67% of human DBRF [dog bite-related fatality] in the United States between 1997 and 1998\" and that it was \"extremely unlikely that they accounted for anywhere near 60% of dogs in the United States during that same period and, thus, there appears to be a breed-specific problem with fatalities.\"However, the article continued, saying that care should be taken in drawing conclusions based on these data because:\n\nfirst, the study likely covered only about 74% of actual DBRF cases;\nsecond, records of DBRF may have been biased by the propensity of media to report attacks by certain breeds over others;\nthird, it is not always straightforward to identify a dog's breed, and records may be biased towards reporting \"known\" aggressive breeds; and\nfourth, it was not clear how to count mixed breeds.\nfifth, such breeds have traditionally been used in dogfighting at a far higher percentage than others.The authors concluded by noting that \"breeds responsible for human DBRF have varied over time\" (for example, Great Danes caused the most reported DBRF between 1979 and 1980). In the face of this inconclusive data, the study authors recommended that breed should not be the \"primary factor driving public policy\", instead making the following policy recommendations: \"adequate funding for animal control agencies, enforcement of existing animal control laws, and educational and policy strategies to reduce inappropriate dog and owner behaviors\" as likely to be beneficial and specifically to decrease the occurrence of dog bites.In a peer-reviewed literature review of 66 dog-bite risk studies, the American Veterinary Medical Association determined that \"breed is a poor sole predictor of dog bites. Controlled studies reveal no increased risk for the group blamed most often for dog bites, \u2018pit bull-type\u2019 dogs.  Accordingly, targeting this breed or any other as a basis for dog-bite prevention is unfounded.\" As stated by the National Animal Control Association: \"Dangerous and/or vicious animals should be labeled as such as a result of their actions or behavior and not because of their breed.\"In 2014, new statistical evidence emerged regarding the province-wide ban on \"pit bulls\", more specifically the American Pit Bull Terrier and American Staffordshire Terrier, in the Canadian province of Ontario. It was reported to show that since the ban had been implemented, dog bites involving the two breeds and dogs of their likeness had dropped considerably in the province's largest city Toronto, yet overall dog bites hit their highest levels this century in 2013 and 2014.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThe breed tends to have a higher than average incidence of hip dysplasia.\nCulling for performance has helped eliminate this problem and others such as patella problems, thyroid dysfunction and congenital heart defects. American Pit Bull Terriers with dilute coat colors have not had a higher occurrence of skin allergies as other breeds. As a breed they are more susceptible to parvovirus than others if not vaccinated, especially as puppies, so vaccination is imperative beginning at 39 days old and continuing every 2 weeks until 4 months old. Then again at 8 months. Once a year after that, as recommend for all breeds.They are very prone to Demodex Mange due to culling for performance. There are two different types of Demodex Mange, namely Localized and Generalized Demodex. Although it is not contagious it is sometimes difficult to treat due to immunodeficiency in some puppies. The Localized symptoms are usually loss of hair in small patches on the head and feet of the puppies. This type will usually heal as the puppies grow and their immune systems grow stronger. The second type which is Generalized Demodex mange is a more severe form of the sickness. The symptoms are more severe and include loss of hair throughout the entire body and the skin may also be scabby and bloody. Generalized are usually hereditary due to immunodeficiency genes that are passed on from Sire and Dam to their puppies. A simple skin scraping test will allow the vet to diagnose demodex mange. The most widely used method to treat Demodex Mange is ivermectin injections or oral medications. Since Demodex Mange lives in the hair follicles of the dog, Ivermectin will kill these mites at the source.\n\n\n== Strains ==\nThe APBT has several strains/bloodlines, many originated in dog fighting, and others developed for the conformation shows of the UKC. But at least two strains can be mentioned among some of the most important strains.\n\n\n=== Colby pit bulls ===\n\nThe Colby dogs are an ancient black-nosed bloodline that served as one of the pillars of the APBT breed. Considered one of the most important strains, and one of the most famous, the Colby dogs were started by John P. Colby in 1889, who acquired the best fighting dogs (Bull and Terriers) imported from Ireland and England.\nOne of the most famous dogs of this bloodline was Colby's Pincher. Pincher was known as an invincible fighting dog, was widely used as a stud dog and for this reason Pincher is present in pedigree of the vast majority of APBT specimens.\nToday, the Colby dogs strain remains preserved by the family of John P. Colby.\n\n\n=== Old Family Red Nose ===\nOld Family Red Nose (OFRN) is an old strain or a family of bloodlines originating in Ireland, and known for their specific and unique reddish coloration. A dog of the OFRN strain has a copper-red nose and coat, red lips, red toe nails, and red or amber eyes. But not every American Pit Bull Terrier with these characteristics is necessarily an OFRN, since for this the dog must have a high percentage of the bloodlines of this family in its genealogy.\n\n\n==== OFRN history ====\nIn the middle of the 19th century, there was a strain of pit dogs in Ireland that were known as \"Old Family.\" At that time, all the bloodlines were closely inbred with each family clan. Since red is recessive to all colors but white, the strain was known as \"Irish Old Family Reds.\" When the dogs began coming to America, they were already showing the red nose.The \"Old Family Reds\" dogs found their way to America  in the 19th century mainly via Irish immigrants though many in the United States did import the breed.Many strains have been crossed with the Old Family Reds at some time in their existence.  Consequently, nearly any strain will occasionally throw a red-nosed pup. This means that not every red-nose dog is a true OFRN. The Old Family Reds produced more than their share of good ones unlike other strains are known. Old Family Reds were sought after for their high percentage in ability to produce deep gameness. The strain in its purest form continues to be preserved by remaining breeders specializing in this bloodline.\nIt was once renowned for its gameness, but now it is bred to maintain its unique reddish color. Some of the most reputable breeders of the past, such as Lightner, McClintock, Hemphill, Williams, Menefee, Norrod and Wallace have contributed to the preservation and development of the strain. Finally, as McNolty said in his 30-30 Journal (1967) \"Regardless of one's historical perspective, these old amber-eyed, red-nosed, red-toe-nailed, red-coated dogs represent some of the most significant pit bull history and tradition that stands on four legs today.\"\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\nAmerican Pit Bull Terriers excel in many dog sports, including weight pulling, dog agility, flyball, lure coursing, and advanced obedience competition. Out of the 115 dogs who have earned UKC \"superdog\" status (by gaining championship titles in conformation, obedience, agility, and weightpull), 34 have been American Pit Bull Terriers, and another 13 were American Staffordshire Terriers.The American Pit Bull Terrier is a working dog, and is suitable for a wide range of working disciplines due to their intelligence, high energy, and endurance. In the United States they have been used as search and rescue dogs, police dogs performing narcotics and explosives detection, Border Patrol dogs, hearing dogs to provide services to the deaf, as well as general service dogs. In the South they are often a favorite dog for catching feral pigs.\n\n\n== Law ==\n\nAustralia, Ecuador, Malaysia, New Zealand, the territory of Puerto Rico, Singapore, Venezuela Trinidad and Tobago Denmark, Israel, France, Germany, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Switzerland have enacted some form of breed-specific legislation on pit bull-type dogs, including American Pit Bull Terriers, ranging from outright bans to restrictions on import and conditions on ownership. The state of New South Wales in Australia places restrictions on the breed, including mandatory sterilization.Certain counties and cities in the United States have banned ownership of the American Pit Bull Terrier, as well as the province of Ontario in Canada. American Pit Bull Terriers are also on a list of four breeds that are banned in the UK.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBull and Terrier (ancestor of the APBT)\nOld English Bulldog\nPit Boss (TV series)\nPit Bulls & Parolees (TV series)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nADBA Heritage American Pit Bull Terrier Conformation Standard\nUnited Kennel Club American Pit Bull Terrier"}, {"id": 24, "name": "American Staffordshire Terrier", "country": "United States", "type": "", "picture": "dog24", "description": "The American Staffordshire Terrier, also known as the Amstaff (in the United States), is a medium-sized, short-coated American dog breed. It is one of several breeds in the pit bull group. In the early part of the twentieth century the breed gained social stature and was accepted by the American Kennel Club in 1936 and should not be confused with the Staffordshire Bull Terrier of the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Staffordshire Terrier's ancestor, the bull and terrier was first bred in the nineteenth century in Birmingham. The early ancestors of this breed came from England where, until the first part of the 19th century, the Bulldog was bred. Bulldogs pictured as late as 1870 resemble the Staffordshire Terrier's ancestor, the contemporary American Staffordshire Terriers, to a greater degree than present-day Bulldogs.\nSome writers contend it was the English White Terrier, Fox Terrier, or the Black and Tan Terrier that was crossed with the Bulldog to develop the Staffordshire Bull Terrier; all three breeds shared many traits, the greatest differences being in color and spirit. The cross of Bulldog and Terrier was called by several names, including Bull-and-Terrier Dog, \"Pit Bull Terrier\" (Bull terrier used to fight on pit), or Half and Half. Later, it assumed the name of Staffordshire Bull Terrier in England. These dogs began to find their way into America as early as 1850. It became a new breed and was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 10 February, 1898, with the name American Pit Bull Terrier. In 1936 50 Ukc registered pit bulls were accepted for registration in the American Kennel Club (AKC) Stud Book as Staffordshire Terriers with a new standard and purpose, belonging to the terrier and molosser groups. The name of the breed was revised January 1, 1969 to American Staffordshire Terrier; breeders in the United States of America had developed a variety which was heavier in weight than the Staffordshire Bull Terrier of England or American Pit Bull Terrier American Pit Bull Terrier. The name change was to distinguish them as separate breeds.The breed's popularity began to decline in the United States following World War II. In 2013 the American Kennel Club ranked the American Staffordshire Terrier as the 81st most popular purebred in the United States.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nAccording to the American Kennel Club \"The Am Staff is a people-oriented dog that thrives when he is made part of the family and given a job to do. Although friendly, this breed is loyal to his own family.\"\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe American Staffordshire Terrier should give the impression of great strength for his size, a well put-together dog, muscular, but agile and graceful, keenly alive to his surroundings. He should be stocky, not long-legged or racy in outline. Height and weight should be in proportion. A height of about 18 to 19 inches (46 to 48 cm) at shoulders for the male and 17 to 18 inches (43 to 46 cm) for the female is to be considered preferable.\nAmerican Staffordshire Terrier pups should not be bought weaned before they are 8\u201310 weeks old. Their life expectancy is generally 12 years with good care.\nThe breed may be vulnerable to skin allergies, urinary tract infections (UTI), and autoimmune diseases. Spondylosis and osteoarthritis are common in older dogs.\nNotable issues related to health and-well being include:\n\nCongenital heart disease\nElbow dysplasia\nHip dysplasia\nLuxating patella\nThyroid dysfunction\nCerebellar ataxia\n\n\n== Breed-specific legislation ==\nWorldwide, the American Staffordshire Terrier has been subject to breed bans that target the Bull and Terrier family in response to incidents involving pit bulls or similar dog breeds. This legislation ranges from outright bans on possession to restrictions and conditions of ownership. The appropriateness and effectiveness of breed-specific legislation in preventing dog-related fatalities and injuries is disputed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nStaffordshire Bull Terrier\nIrish Bull Terrier\nAmerican Pit Bull Terrier\nBull Terrier\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nListed by year of publication\n\nFraser, Jacqueline.

Developed in the state of Wisconsin during the 19th century from a number of other breeds, including the Irish and English Water Spaniels. The breed was saved by Dr. Fred J. Pfeifer, who set up the breed club and standard, and whose work led to recognition for the breed by the United Kennel Club, and later, the American Kennel Club. While they are the state dog of Wisconsin, they remain a rare breed.\nThey are medium-sized dog, and have a double layered coat, which comes in a variety of brown related shades. A versatile hunting dog, they are also suitable for apartment life due to work by breeders to develop a breed with an even temperament. The AWS may have been involved in the development of the Boykin Spaniel.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nDeveloped in the United States, the American Water Spaniel is the Wisconsin state dog. The breed originated in the areas along the Fox River and its tributary the Wolf River during the early 19th century. Hunters needed a dog that could work on both land and water, a versatile hunter skilled at bringing in a variety of game. Hunters also wanted a hunting dog compact enough to be transported in a small skiff, one that was able to withstand Wisconsin's cold water temperatures. Breeds involved in the creation of the American Water Spaniel are thought to have included the English Water Spaniel, Irish Water Spaniel, Curly Coated Retriever, native Indian Dogs, the Poodle, and either the Sussex Spaniel or another type of field spaniel.This little brown dog created was known at the time as the American Brown Spaniel, and weighed around 40 pounds (18 kg). It had a thick curly coat that protected it from the cold temperatures of the water and winter. It was used to hunt waterfowl, ruffed grouse, greater prairie chicken and a variety of fur\u2013bearing animals.\n\nOver the years the numbers of the breed began to dwindle due both to a reduction in the duck population through those valley areas, and because of a switch in hunting \u2013 from a means to gather food for survival to that of recreation. Additionally, following World War II, new types of dogs became available in Wisconsin such as setters, pointers and other spaniels, allowing additional specialization in hunting.Dr. Fred J. Pfeifer, from New London, Wisconsin, set up Wolf River Kennels in order to save the breed. Numbers held by the kennel fluctuated but at times went up to 132 dogs. He advertised the dogs widely across the country, selling male dogs for $25 and females dogs for $20. Part of a sales pitch that Pfeifer mailed to prospective dog owners read, \"The American Brown Spaniel is distinctively an American production. Hunters have known this type for years and it was through their efforts that this dog was propagated.... For years we have bred only selective stock, breeding for gameness, stability, courage, intelligence, and beauty. They are dogs to admire and trust under all conditions whether in the home circle or in the field with the outdoor man.\"Due to Pfeifer's work, the breed was recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) as the American Water Spaniel in 1920, and by the Field Dog Stud Book in 1938. Dr. Pfeifer's own dog, named \"Curly Pfeifer\" was the first American Water Spaniel to be registered with UKC. John Scofield of Missouri and Thomas Brogdan of Rush Lake, Wisconsin worked together with the American Water Spaniel Club (AWSC), gaining the breed recognition with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1940. Prior to recognition by the AKC, the breed had not been shown in the show ring before.The breed has links to the Boykin Spaniel, and is thought to have been the main breed used to develop the Boykin. The differences between the Boykin and the AWS are negligible with some dog historians suggesting that the original Boykin, called \"Dumpy\", who was found on the streets of Spartanburg, South Carolina, was actually an American Water Spaniel who had been misplaced in transit. However the breed clubs for the Boykin do not agree with this account.The breed was made the state dog of Wisconsin in 1985. The American Water Spaniel remains a rare breed. During 1998 only 233 puppies were registered with the AKC, with an estimated 3,000 dogs in existence mostly around the Midwestern United States, in particular in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan. In 2010, the breed was ranked 143rd most popular breed in the United States, out of 167 breeds. This is a decrease since 2000, when the breed was ranked 125th. The dogs are not classified specifically as either retrievers or as spaniels and so may not compete in AKC field trials, but may compete in AKC hunt tests (spaniel and retriever tests) and retriever hunting tests sponsored by the AWSC, the breed club in the United States. The American Water Spaniel Field Association was set up in 1993 by breed enthusiasts supporting AKC Spaniel classification and looking to provide field training opportunities to owners of the breed. In a vote held of members of the AWSC in 1999, they chose to keep the breed unclassified.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe limited popularity of the American Water Spaniel restricted development, resulting in the breed being relatively unchanged since its origins in the 19th century. They are a medium-sized dog, with a curly liver, brown, or chocolate colored coat. The average height at the withers for the breed is 15\u201318 inches (38\u201346 cm), and their weight around 25\u201345 pounds (11\u201320 kg). They have similar features to the Irish Water Spaniel, but the Irish breed is larger at between 21\u201324 inches (53\u201361 cm) and weighing 55\u201365 pounds (25\u201329 kg). The coat of the American Water Spaniel can fall in two different patterns, either tightly curled or in the \"marcel pattern\" where the fur falls in waves. Working and show lines have not diverged as with some other breeds of spaniel, and both appear the same, with show dogs of this breed being rare.The coat has a coarse outside layer which keeps water away and protects the dog from foliage such as briers. The inside layer provides insulation to keep the dog warm. The coat has an oily feel to it, which gives off a \"doggy smell\". The breed standard specifies color of the eyes should harmonize with the color of the coat, and should never be yellow. The skull is broad, and carries long, wide ears. The tail is not typically docked.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nIn the field, the AWS is less exuberant than the English Springer Spaniel, but it is as skilled in retrieval as Labrador or Golden Retriever. It is versatile regardless of the type of terrain, and in the water it is not the fastest swimmer but has a high level of endurance. The breed is also good at agility and flyball, with the first of the breed receiving a flyball championship title in 1993.Members of the breed enjoy being the center of attention, and can be quite vocal at times. It is a one family dog, and will often bond with one particular individual. For many years the breed was \"pack bred\", where they were allowed to live in a group. Since these times, breeders have been working to breed even tempered dogs that are suitable for both hunting and family life.The AWS has a mind of its own at times and reaches peak performance with the owner who is dedicated to teaching the dog just what is expected of it. The breed takes well to training, and especially excels at training that offers some variety rather than routine training drills. However, members of the breed can may have issues with food possessiveness. They can be stubborn, and mentally are slow to mature from puppyhood. Some lines of the breed still retain dominant and aggressive temperaments; other than these lines, the AWS gets on well with children and enjoys playing with them. Even though they were originally bred to hunt, due to their size, they are suitable for apartment living as long as they receive enough exercise.\n\n\n== Health ==\nPack breeding early in its development led to a level of genetic variation, so the hereditary conditions of more popular breeds are not common in the AWS. The breed however is known to suffer from eye issues including cataracts and progressive retinal atrophy. Inheritance is suspected in both conditions, with the average age of cataract onset at under one year old.Additional concerns are hypothyroidism, allergies, epilepsy, diabeties and glandular disorders which may cause baldness. The hair loss occurs at around six months of age, affecting the neck, thighs and tail; however the frequency has been reduced through work conducted by the breed clubs. Hip dysplasia is seen in around 8.3% of the breed, according to surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals over a twenty five-year period between 1974 and 1999. This was one of the lower results of the sporting breeds, with Greyhounds coming lowest with 3.4%, and the related Boykin Spaniel coming in second highest at 47%. There was no evidence of elbow dysplasia found. The breed has an average life span of 10\u201313 years.\n\n\n== References ==\nSpecific\nGeneral\n\n\n== External links ==\nAmerican Water Spaniel at Curlie"}, {"id": 26, "name": "Anatolian Shepherd Dog", "country": "Turkey", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog26", "description": "The Anatolian Shepherd Dog (Turkish: Anadolu \u00e7oban k\u00f6pe\u011fi) is a breed of dog which originated in the Anatolia region of central Turkey. It is rugged, large and very strong, with good sight and hearing that allow it to protect livestock.  With its high speed and agility it is able to run down a predator with great efficiency.Historically, it has been treated as a separate breed to the Kangal Shepherd Dog by many canine registries, but is now generally treated as part of the same breed population.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe  Karaba\u015f (Blackhead) is descended from ancient livestock guardian dog types that migrated with the transhumance, guarding flocks of sheep from wolves and cheetahs. It is probable that dogs of this type existed 6,000 years ago in what is now Turkey.\nAnatolian Shepherd Dogs are members of a very old breed, probably descended from powerful hunting dogs from Mesopotamia. This mountain dog breed was developed over time to meet a specific set of circumstances. The most formative were climate (very hot, dry summers and very cold winters), lifestyle (sedentary, semi-nomadic and nomadic) and duties (guarding flocks moving great distances on the Central Anatolian Plateau).\n\nIn the 1970s, breeders in the West became interested in these dogs and began developing the landrace natural breeds as modern breeds by documenting their descent from particular ancestors and writing breed standards. The Anatolian Shepherd Dog was imported from central Turkey into the United Kingdom by author and archaeologist Charmian Hussey..\nAustralia registered the Anatolian Shepherd Dog breed in 1985 when it was imported as a guard dog for livestock, people and property.   Australia\u2019s expansive sheep and goat enterprises contributed to the breed\u2019s acceptance as a livestock guardian dog beyond Turkey, and developed the sheep and goat guard dog of the Turkish Shepherd into an imposing guard dog of livestock and farm assets for Agriultural and Farming Industry. The working conditions and requirements of the dogs in Australia and the assets of Australian farmers, are very different to the generally impoverished Shepherd in Turkey and his herd of goats and sheep.   Australian farmland is fenced, and the dogs are required to protect valuable assets against four and two legged threats. \n\u201cAnatolian Karabash Guard Dogs.  Guarding sheep cattle, goats, deer, poultry, ocean vessels, persons and property etc\nAgainst: predators (dingoes, wild dogs, foxes, eagles), stock thieves, trespassers and raiding wild life (kangaroos etc)\u201d\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe general appearance of the Anatolian Shepherd Dog is a tall, rugged and powerful livestock guardian dog with a dense double coat, a broad strong head, well-developed muscular shoulders, and a long tail with a slight curl (reaching to the hock), that is carried high and curled over the dog's back when the dog is alert.   The physique embodies balance and strength.  Movement of the Anatolian Shepherd Dog should be supple and powerful.  A low head carriage which shows the head, neck and topline being level when moving - creating the impression that the dog is stalking - is an important characteristic of the breed.\nAs with many breeds, there are several breed standards for the Anatolian Shepherd Dog, and therefore there is some variance in the described size and weight. They weigh between 40 and 70 kg (90 and 150 pounds), with females on the smaller side and males on the larger side. The coat may be any colour, although most common are white cream, \"sesame,\" and white with large coloured spots that do not cover more than 30% of the body. Known as piebald, these colours may or may not be accompanied by a black mask and/or ears.\nThey have a thick double coat that is somewhat wiry, and needs to be brushed 1-2 times a week in warm weather due to excessive shedding. They have very thick hair on their neck to protect their throat. They look as if they are heavier than they actually are, due to the thick coat.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Anatolian Shepherd dog was developed to be independent and forceful, responsible for guarding its master's flocks without human assistance or direction. These traits make it challenging as a pet; owners of dogs of this breed must socialize the dogs to turn them into appropriate companions.  They are intelligent and can learn quickly but might choose not to obey.\nThe Anatolian Shepherd Dog is very loyal and can be fiercely possessive and protective of its family, stock and territory. The Anatolian is also a bold, confident dog that does not become overstimulated easily. They are generally curious but aloof with guests. They are not outgoing dogs that want to make friends with everyone and dislike strangers who are too forward. They are calm and observant of their surroundings and may not go looking for trouble, but he may not back down if challenged. An Anatolian that has been agitated may be too angry to be controlled and cannot be stopped on command.\nAccording to Turkish shepherds, three Anatolian Shepherd Dogs are capable of overcoming a pack of wolves and injuring one or two of them. These dogs like to roam, as they were bred to travel with their herd and to leave the herd to go hunt for predators before the predators could attack the flock. Therefore, it is recommended to microchip and tag pets.\nThe Anatolian Shepherd is not recommended for life in small quarters. They do well with other animals, including cats if they are introduced while still a puppy and have their own space. They mature between 18\u201330 months. Due to their history, both puppies and adults seem to have little interest in fetching. Rather, they prefer to run and sometimes swim.\nPresence of some Anatolian shepherd genes in Alaskan huskies positively correlates with husky work ethic.\n\n\n=== Breed ===\nThere is some discussion about whether the Anatolian Shepherd is a distinct breed, or a general name for different types of shepherd dogs in Anatolia that look alike (such as the Kangal, which is used as a synonym for the Anatolian Shepherd and has the same 'Blackhead' -karabas- nickname). This view accepts the name Anatolian Shepherd as a general name for breeds such as the Kangal dog, Akbash dog and the Aksaray Malaklisi dog. Recognition of the Kangal as a different breed than the Anatolian Shepherd was retracted in Australia.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n=== Life span ===\nThere appears to be only one health survey of Anatolian Shepherds, done in 2004 by the UK Kennel Club.  The median life span for the 23 deceased dogs (a small sample size) in the survey was 10.75 years. This is 3\u20134 years longer than other breeds of their size, which have median longevities of 6\u20138 years. The leading causes of death of the dogs in the survey were cancer (22%), \"combinations\" (17%), cardiac (13%), and old age (13%).\n\n\n=== Health issues ===\nBased on a small sample of 24 still-living dogs, the most common health issues cited by owners were dermatologic, musculoskeletal, and lipomas.  Entropion and canine hip dysplasia are sometimes seen in the breed.  Eyes and hips should be tested before breeding.\n\n\n== Use in conservation ==\nAnatolian Shepherd dogs are used by Dr. Laurie Marker and the Cheetah Conservation Fund in Namibia in their ongoing efforts to prevent livestock-hunting cheetahs being killed by farmers.\nThese dogs are bred and then given to the farmers to use in protecting and guarding their livestock from cheetah attacks.  The dogs are an effective, non-lethal discouragement that prevents the cheetahs from taking livestock. The incentive for farmers to preemptively shoot the cheetahs is thus removed, and the cheetahs then concentrate their hunting on wild game.\n\n\n== Kangal Dog and Anatolian Shepherd ==\nThe UK Kennel Club has announced it is to recognise the Kangal Dog as a breed with effect from July 2013. It also stated that dogs currently registered as Anatolian Shepherd Dogs may be eligible (where appropriate) to be recorded as Turkish Kangal Dogs instead.As of 1 January 2012, the Australian National Kennel Council no longer recognises the ANKC Kangal as being a separate breed from the ANKC Anatolian Shepherd.June 2018: The Federation CynoIogique International Standards Commission determined the population of FCI registered Anatolian Shepherd Dogs and Kangals Shepherd Dogs in Turkey were the same breed and belonged to the same breed population.  FCI Anatolian Shepherd Dog = Standard No. 331 = FCI Kangal Shepherd Dog.  The breed name of Anatolian Shepherd Dog was changed to Kangal Shepherd Dog and the breed standard content was updated.  Under the FCI the Kangal Shepherd Dog is not defined as a separate breed to the FCI Anatolian Shepherd Dog.  The population of FCI Registered Anatolian Shepherd Dogs are renamed to Kangal Shepherd Dog, and an updated breed standard for that population of dogs put in place.  If it was possible for the Kangal Shepherd Dog breed to be genetically distinct and differentiated from the Anatolian Shepherd Dog, the Kangal Shepherd Dog would have undergone the FCI Provisional and Definitive breed recognition process and be issued its own FCI Standard Number.\n\n\n== Famous Anatolian Shepherd Dogs ==\nDuke; animal ambassador at the San Diego Zoo. \n\nIn fiction\nBart, from Kate and Leopold\nButch, from Cats & Dogs and Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore\nCorky, from Road Trip\nMarlowe, from Simon & Simon\nSam, from ShooterOther\nHaatchi, a three-legged Anatolian Shepherd who has formed a special bond with Owen, a 7-year-old boy suffering from Schwartz-Jampel syndrome.

These dogs are similar to other Iberian breeds such as the Ibizan Hound, the Portuguese Podengo, the Podenco Canario and the Maneto. In the Iberian Peninsula there are cave paintings representing dogs with a strong resemblance to these races. Dogs very similar to these, including the Cirneco dell'Etna and Pharaoh Hound, have been bred in much of the Mediterranean basin since ancient times. Despite the widespread belief that the podencos were introduced into Spain some 3,000 years ago by the Phoenicians, recent genetic studies have concluded that these dogs actually have a close genetic relationship with other European hunting dogs and are no more \"primitive\" than the others.\n\n\n== Standardization and recognition ==\nDespite being a native ancient breed, it was not until 1990 that it entered the world of official cynology with the formation of a breed club to promote the development of breed standards. Phillipe Bloque-Rent\u00f3n and colleagues at the University of C\u00f3rdoba's veterinary medicine faculty undertook the research work required to specify the breed; their study, presented at the second Simposium de las razas caninas espa\u00f1olas (Spanish dog breeds symposium) in 1992, was recognized by Real Sociedad Canina de Espa\u00f1a (Royal Spanish Dog Society, RSCE) in April of that year as a defining breed standard. In Spain, Andalusian hounds were included within Group V - Spitz and Primitive Types, under Section 7, Primitive type - Hunting dogs. However, the breed is recognized neither by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) nor by any other international dog breeds association, due to the large number of matches with the Portuguese Podengo standard \u2014 a fact which casts doubt on its claim to be regarded as a separate breed.\nIn January 2015, the Andalusian Hound was nationally recognized in Germany.\n\n\n== Varieties ==\n\nAs in the Portuguese Podengo, the Andalusian Hound comes in three sizes (large, medium and small) and with three types of coat (wire-haired, long-haired and smooth). This combination of factors can results in nine different varieties. There is also a dwarf or basset variety derived from a medium-sized short-haired Andalusian Hound \u2014 called Maneto from its short, stout legs \u2014 which the RSCE has provisionally accepted as a distinct breed.\n\n\n== Breed features ==\nAndalusian Podencos, like other hounds, have excellent sight, hearing and smell, which makes them good hunters, often employed for hunting rabbits. Andalusians and mastiffs form the heart of the rehalas (teams of 20 to 24 hunting dogs) of central and southern parts of the Iberian Peninsula; medium and smaller dogs search out deer or wild boar, whilst the larger hounds are used for attacking the prey.\nOne of the most typical functions of the large Andalusian hound was that of the so-called quitaor accompanying the Spanish greyhound colleras during hare hunting. The quitaor\u2018s job consisted primarily of flushing out the hares from their home or hiding place and killing them; then, together with the greyhounds, retrieving them for the owner. In Andalusian farmhouses the larger hounds were used as watchdogs, and the smaller hounds were used to kill rodents.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nClub Nacional del Podenzo Aldaluz, the Spanish national Andalusian hound club"}, {"id": 28, "name": "Anglo-Fran\u00e7ais de Petite V\u00e9nerie", "country": "France", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog28", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 29, "name": "Appenzeller Sennenhund", "country": "Switzerland", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog29", "description": "The Appenzeller Sennenhund is a medium-size breed of dog, one of the four regional breeds of Sennenhund-type dogs from the Swiss Alps. The name Sennenhund refers to people called Senn, herders in the Appenzell region of Switzerland.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Appenzeller Sennenhund is a medium-sized mountain dog, 18.5-23 ins (47\u201358 cm) at the withers and weighing 49-71 lbs (22\u201332 kg). Like the other Sennenhunds, the Appenzeller Sennenhund has a heavy, molosser-like build and a distinctive tricolour coat. The breed's ears are small and triangular, set high and hanging down against the dog's cheeks, similar to a button ear. Faults in the breed's appearance include wall eye, kinked tail, a single coat, and a coat that is not tricolour.\n\n\n=== Four breeds of Sennenhund ===\nThe four breeds of Sennenhund, with the original breed name followed by the most popular English version of the breed name.\n\nGrosser Schweizer Sennenhund, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog\nBerner Sennenhund, Bernese Mountain Dog\nAppenzeller Sennenhund, Appenzeller Mountain Dog\nEntlebucher Sennenhund, Entlebucher Mountain Dog\n\n\n== History and purpose ==\nThe Appenzeller Sennenhund is descended from the general Sennenhund type which may have existed in antiquity, or descended from \"cattle dogs left there by the Romans\", but the first breed club for the breed was founded and the stud book for the breed started in 1906 by Albert Heim and others, who wrote the first breed standard in 1916. An early reference to the breed's predecessors was made in an 1853 book, \"Tierleben der Alpenwelt\" (Animal Life in the Alps), referring to dogs in the Appenzell region. The Appenzeller Sennenhund was only recognised internationally as a separate breed in 1989.The Appenzeller Sennenhund was originally kept primarily as a cattle herding dog, and a flock guardian. It was also used as a draft dog, and general farm dog. The breed also was known for its affinity to both herd and guard with such devotion that they would give their life to protect their charge. Today the breed is primarily kept as a companion, and excels in agility/flyball competitions, obedience competitions and Schutzhund. They are also still used in many places as working cattle dogs even now. They are highly intelligent, and learn quickly.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nAs with all medium to large, very active working dogs, the Appenzeller Sennenhund should be well socialized early in life with other dogs and people and provided with regular activity and training if it is to be safely kept as a pet. If trained properly, they bond closely with their owners and like to seek for attention. As a result of careful regulated breeding, the Appenzeller breed as a whole is an extremely healthy breed, though individual genetic lines vary. The breed is known to have an average lifespan of 13\u201317 years.\nAccording to the breed standard, the Appenzeller Sennenhund is lively, high spirited, athletic and suspicious of strangers. Due to his large size and high energy levels, the Appenzeller Sennenhund is not recommended as an apartment dog.\n\n\n== Kennel club recognition ==\nThe breed is recognised with the Swiss breed standard under the name Appenzeller Sennenhund, translated into English as Appenzell Cattle Dog, by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in Group 2 Pinscher and Schnauzer\u2014Molossoid breeds\u2014Swiss Mountain and Cattle Dogs and other breeds, Section 3 Swiss Mountain and Cattle Dogs. The breed is also recognised in the United States by the United Kennel Club in their Guardian Dog Group under the name Appenzeller, and is listed as a breed in the Foundation Stock Service by the American Kennel Club with the name Appenzeller Sennenhunde. The breed is not currently recognised by The Kennel Club or the other major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world, although it is also registered by small clubs and internet-based breed registries, and is promoted in North America by the Appenzeller Mountain Dog Club of America as a rare breed for puppy buyers seeking a unique pet.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCanine terminology\nMountain dog\nAppenzell goat\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAMDCA - Appenzeller Mountain Dog Club of America\nGenetics of tricolour coats, KG\nDMOZ links to more information about Appenzeller Sennenhund"}, {"id": 30, "name": "Ariege Pointer", "country": "France", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog30", "description": "The Braque de l'Ari\u00e8ge, translated into English as the Ariege Pointing Dog or Ariege Pointer,  is a breed of dog, a French hunting dog of pointing gun dog type.

The coat is short and primarily white, speckled with larger patches of colours described as orange, liver, or chestnut on the head and ears. Size is about 60\u201367 centimetres (24\u201326 in) in height at the withers. Dogs of the breed should appear powerful but without excessive heaviness, robust and of strong.\n\n\n== History and use ==\nThe dog type used by hunters in the Ariege region of the Pyrenees were said to be descended from dogs that were crosses of the Perdigueiro de Burgos and the Bracco Italiano.  The breed was developed in the 20th century by Braqque Saint-Germain and Braque Francais with the local dogs,  to give them more lightness and activity. During World War II, the breed almost disappeared.\nIn 1990 a team of breeders decided to devote themselves to the Braque de l'Ari\u00e8ge's survival.

It is believed to be a descendant of European dogs, that were introduced by Napoleon's troops, crossed with Briards. They are named after the town of Armant in Egypt. The breed's fearlessness when confronted by predators as well as its loyalty see them put to use in Egypt as guard dogs.\n\n\n== Description ==\nA typical dog is 21 and 23 inches (53 and 58 cm) at the withers and weighs between 50 and 65 pounds (23 and 29 kg). It has a large head, small eyes and a deep, broad chest. The ears differ in each one and there is no standard concerning the ears (they may be erect or drooped). Armants can be of multiple colours, the most common of which are the black, black and tan, gray and gray-yellow variations. Armants are a very agile breed. The breed is very obedient and quite protective of its territory, which it will fearlessly defend.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nArmants are good working dogs with a fearless and loyal temperament. They generally respond well to training but require a firm owner to accomplish this. They bond well with other animals and are very good with children.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe average lifespan of an Armant is 13 years, which is typical for a medium-sized breed.

It is not recognized by major kennel clubs or fancier organizations as a dog breed because it is a landrace.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe modern Gampr has changed little within the history of its existence in Armenian Highlands. It is one of few natural breeds not subjected to hard selection by phenotype. They preserved the genetic variation that other dog breeds had initially. This genetic variation was promoted by spontaneous and, in some cases, intentional periodic matings with locally indigenous wolves (still present). Gamprs differ by their vital capacity, independence, mind, strong self-preservation instinct, capacity for trustworthy defense and protection of livestock, and exclusive friendliness to humans.This mountain dog's head is large, well-outlined and well-developed but lacks prominent cheekbones. The back is wide, straight, muscular and strong. At the withers, the height in male dogs is 65 centimetres (26 in) or more, and in female dogs is 62 centimetres (24 in) or more. Weight corresponds to the total size of the dog, and usually varies from 45 to 60 kilograms (99 to 132 lb).\nThe Armenian Gampr has a well-developed undercoat, in order to protect it under harsh conditions. Depending upon the coat length, there are two types: long-haired, with long top hairs, and short-haired, with dense, relatively short hair. A brown or piebald coat is undesirable according to the breed standard.\n\n\n== Character and behavior ==\n\nGampr dogs are not trained, instead performing the necessary functions naturally. The Armenian word \"Gampr\" means \"watchdog\", but the same breed may instead be called a \"gelkheht\" (from \"gel\" - \"wolf\" and \"khekhtel\" - \"to choke\") if it is predisposed to be used as a wolfhound; a bear-hunting dog is known as \"archashoon\" (\"bear-dog\"); an avalanche dog is named \"potorkashoon\", and a shepherd dog is named \"hovvashoon\". The Gamprs are very tied to people, especially those dogs that live in human houses, because they feel themselves a family or pack member.\n\n\n== Kennel club recognition ==\nThe Armenian Gampr is not recognized by any of the major kennel clubs or other fancier organisations around the world.In April 2011, a new organisation called the International Kennel Union (IKU), but acts in 17 countries, including Spain, Bulgaria, Greece, Armenia, Russia, Ukraine, Georgia and others, officially recognized the Armenian Gampr as Armenia\u2019s national dog breed.\n\n\n== Breeding ==\n\nIn Armenia Gampr dogs are bred by \"Gampr\", Tiknapah\", Aralez\" and \"Aspar\" Clubs, as well as \"Amasia\" Kennel that carry on the breeding to preserve the phenotype and working traits of Gampr dogs.\nOnly dogs without any inclusions of non-Gampr (i.e. CAO, Alabai, Kochee etc.) bloodlines shall be bred as Gampr, in order to keep the breed pure. There are two strains of gampr, the palace guardian type and the livestock type. The livestock type tends to be smaller, tireless, and slightly more volatile. The palace guardians are generally taller, more square-built, and fairly congenial but still very protective. They have a tendency to be more sedentary, and to stay in one location. During the invasions of Armenia over the last several hundred years, the palace guardian type dogs have been dispersed, with a few remaining in remote villages, but many were taken out of the country and used in the development of the breeds elsewhere, such as the CAO, and in the Red Star Kennel in the USSR.\nThe geographic and cultural coexistence of the Caucasian Ovcharka and the Central Asian Ovcharka, and its use as a standard, is itself seen as an issue threatening the continued existence of the Armenian Gampr dog landrace.  The Armenian Gampr Club of America states: \"The gampr is not: An Alabai, a Caucasian Ovcharka, a Kangal, an Anatolian, an Akbash, a Karakatchan, a Central Asian Shepherd, a Koochee, a Tornjak, a Sharplaninatz, or a cross of these.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"A Brief History of the Armenian Gampr\".

A scent hound 22-23 inches high at the withers, weighing anything between 55 and 65 pounds, it is a well constructed dog with a slow graceful gait. It has a large, strong head, a medium-length back and a pointed tail that tends to be long and sickle-shaped. Their ears are set at eye level; they have large prominent eyes and quite thick lips.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nA well constructed dog, muscled and not too long, giving the impression of strength and energy.\n\n\n==== Head ====\n\nCranial Region: Its skull should be strong, broad, quite short, rounded and flat at its upper part but with the occipital protuberance only slightly pronounced. Its stop should be accentuated.\nFacial Region: Its nose should be black, strong, with wide opened nostrils. Its muzzle should be straight and, seen in profile, moderately elongated. Of its lips, the upper lip should largely be covering the lower lip and must be rather important so as to give a square shape to the extremity of the muzzle, (as seen in profile). Its jaws/teeth should have a scissor bite, the upper incisors covering the lower in a narrow contact and are well set squarely in relation to the jaws. Its eyes, in relation to the width of the forehead, should not be very close together; they should be round, level with the head surface, with a melancholic and soft expression; they are dark brown in colour.  The mucous membranes of the lower lids must not be visible. Its leathers should be set at eye level, a little thick, broad, round at the tip, almost flat and quite long, reaching the beginning of the nose. Its neck is moderately long, powerful; very little dewlap.\n\n\n==== Body ====\nIts back is broad and well supported. Its loins are slightly arched. The hips give a slight inclination to its croup, which is well muscled. Its chest is broad and long, rather let down so that the sternal line arrives at elbow level. Its  ribs should be well sprung. Its belly flanks fully its body.\n\n\n==== Tail ====\nIt is strong and quite long; there should be some longer and coarser, slightly offstanding hairs, (like ears of grain) towards the tip. It is carried in a sickle fashion, never falling forward.\n\n\n==== Limbs ====\n\n\n===== Forequarters =====\nA view of the ensemble indicates that its limbs are strong and vertical. Its shoulders are oblique and muscled. Its elbows are set well in the axis of the body. Its forearm should be lightly oblique.\n\n\n===== Hindquarters =====\nA view of the ensemble indicates that, (seen from behind), the point of the buttock, the middle of the leg, the hock, the metatarsal and the foot are on the same vertical line. Its upper thighs are let down and well muscled. Its hock joints are strong and moderately angulated, and the metatarsals are short and strong.\n\n\n===== Feet =====\nThey are slightly elongated, strong but sufficiently tight; the pads are black, tough and compact.\n\n\n==== Coat and colour ====\nIts skin is quite thick. Its hair is short, thick and quite flat. The coat pattern is a dark fawn tri-colour, (similar to the coat of a hare or a badger), with a mantle or in large patches. The head is usually fawn, sometimes with a black overlay. Its main colours being tan and black and white in any combination.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Artois Hound is an energetic dog that is brave and loyal. Though it has a large amount of endurance, it is calm and well balanced. It is a moderate sized dog that will feature the best characteristics of the scenthounds. It has a powerful sense of smell, and it is fast and independent. These dogs were bred to hunt rabbits, and they are proficient at this task. These dogs need to be trained by owners who are consistent. They are affectionate and loving to those that care for them. Like all scent hounds they are happiest when on the trail of a good scent.\n\n\n==== Hunting ====\nThe Artois Hound, (a Briquet, (of a small type)), is nowadays used especially in hunting with guns, and on horseback.  It drives the game closer taking advantage of their faults with ingenuity; its speed is average but maintained.\n\nIn general countryside : Because of its acute sense of smell, it is capable of outmanoeuvring many of its prey's tactics.\nIn woodland areas : With its ancestral qualities of a hunter, in sparse and well scattered groups of tall trees, it can hunt a deer efficiently, and in the desired direction of its owner.\nIn the thicket : its intrepidity and bravery means that it can stir up and even the most obstinate boars.\nAdditional points: It is a robust animal with a high pitched call which can be heard from as far away as 2 km.\n\n\n== Health problems ==\nThere are no known health problems that are specific to the Artois Hound. Any health problems it may develop can be found in most other dog breeds. These dogs may have a maximum life expectancy of 13 years.\n\n\n== Care ==\n\n\n=== Exercise ===\nThis is a hunting dog that needs extensive amounts of exercise. Without it, the dog could become problematic for its owners. It should be taken on walks daily, and this dog is great for healthy people who love to jog and hike. While it can live in an apartment, it may perform better in a small yard. It is important for owners to make sure this dog is never unleashed in an unsecured area, as it may run off in the direction of the first interesting scent it picks up. It is important for owners to make sure these dogs are given lots of space to move around in.\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\nThe Artois Hound does not require a large amount of grooming. The Artois' smooth short-haired coat is easy to look after. Owners will simply want to make sure the coat is brushed on a consistent basis. These dogs should only be given baths when they need it. A wipe down with a damp towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (although you should bathe it with mild soap only if or when necessary; you should also dry shampoo it occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard bristled brush would work best for the brushing aspect.The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. Be sure to check the ears carefully for signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections).\n\n\n== History ==\nThis breed, formerly named Picard, was much appreciated in ancient hunting at the time of Henry IV of France and Louis XIII of France, and much sought after. Selincourt already made much of it, wondering and amazed to see these dogs pulling a hare which had passed by one hour ago in dry weather. Le Couteulx de Canteleu, in Manuel de V\u00e9nerie Fran\u00e7aise (1890), (Manual of French Hunting - 1890), praises also the Artois hound. He reports that the artesian breed of his time was crossbred and difficult to find pure but, in spite of that, it still remained one of the best breeds for hare hunting. \nNorthern France, bordering the English Channel, consists of the historical regions of Artois Hound. Hounds from this region stem from some of the earliest types.\n\nThe Artois Hound was a favorite by the 17th century. The Prince Alexandre de Gray wrote to the Prince de Galle, in 1609, of his intention to \"send a pack of little d'Artois dogs to the king ...\" In fact, this small French hound may have contributed to the formation of the Beagle in England.\nBy the 19th century it became popular among French hunters to avail themselves of the dogs from the British Isles. With the importation of many British types, the inevitable crossbreeding resulted in the deterioration of the pure Artois Hounds. Crossing also took place with the taller, more elegant, longer, scroll-eared hounds called Normands (now extinct). During the 19th century, only the packs kept at Chantilly and those of the Prince de Conde retained the ancient type.\nIn the 1880s, Ernest Levair and his cousin, M. Therouanne, began a 20-year effort to breed the original d'Artois, removing the last of the Normand blood.\nTheir efforts resulted in great success. At the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th, M. Levoir in Picardy had attempted the re-establishment of the old Artois type without really succeeding. During that period and until the beginning of the First World War, it was another Picard breeder, Mr. Mallard, who dominated the raising of the breed. But if he produced very pretty dogs, as witnessed by his numerous awards in canine shows, they were not always in the type conformed with the description given by contemporary authors. For all their efforts however the Second World War was very damaging for the breed and after the Second World War, it was believed that the Artois was all but extinct.\nBy the middle of the 20th century the breed had nearly disappeared, however in the 1970s a few aficionados\n, in particular Mr. Audrechy, (of Buigny les Gamaches in the Somme), decided to reconstitute the breed from a few remaining specimens which they located after along search. Thanks to their efforts the modern day Artois hound closely resembles the original. There are now about 500 dogs registered in their stud books, making a strong comeback since 1975.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nNote that the Artois Hound does not yet have breed standards or classifications in any organisation, other than the FCI.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBeagle\nAnglo-Fran\u00e7ais de Petite V\u00e9nerie\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Other sources ===\nCassell, The Book of the Dog\nBonnie Wilcox and Chris Walkowicz, The Atlas of Dog Breeds of the World.\n\n\n== External links ==\nTechnologies, Bryntel. \"Artois Hound Breed Description - The Furry Critter Network\".

This breed is a medium-sized, short-coated dog that occurs in two main colour forms. It has either brown or black hair distributed fairly evenly through a white coat, which gives the appearance of a \"red\" or \"blue\" dog. \nAs with dogs from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is energetic and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, particularly if it is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.\nIn the 19th century, New South Wales cattle farmer Thomas Hall crossed the dogs used by drovers in his parents' home county, Northumberland, with dingoes he had tamed. The resulting dogs were known as Halls Heelers. After Hall's death in 1870, the dogs became available beyond the Hall family and their associates. They were subsequently developed into two modern breeds: the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog. Robert Kaleski, who wrote the first standard for the breed, was influential in its development.\nAustralian Cattle Dog has been nicknamed a \"Red Heeler\" or \"Blue Heeler\" on the basis of its colouring and practice of moving reluctant cattle by nipping at their heels. Dogs from a line bred in Queensland, Australia, which were successful at shows and at stud in the 1940s, were called \"Queensland Heelers\" to differentiate them from lines bred in New South Wales; this nickname is now occasionally applied to any Australian Cattle Dog.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, muscular, compact dog that gives the impression of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.The Cattle Dog breed standard states that it should have well-conditioned muscles, even when bred for companion or show purposes, and that its appearance should be symmetrical and balanced, with no individual part of the dog exaggerated. It should not look either delicate or cumbersome, as either characteristic limits the agility and endurance that is necessary for a working dog.\n\n\n==== Size ====\nThe female Australian Cattle Dog measures approximately 43\u201348 centimetres (17\u201319 in) at the withers, and the male measures about 46\u201351 centimetres (18\u201320 in) at the withers. The dog should be longer than tall, that is, the length of the body from breast bone to buttocks is greater than the height at the withers, in a ratio of 10 to 9. An Australian Cattle Dog in good condition weighs around 15\u201322 kilograms (33\u201349 lb).\n\n\n==== Coat and colour ====\n\nThere are two accepted coat colours, red and blue, though chocolate and cream do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled with or without black, tan, or white markings. Red dogs are evenly speckled with solid red markings. Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration is the result of black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly white coat. This is not merle colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking gene. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of the ticking.In addition to the primary colouration, an Australian Cattle Dog displays some patches of solid or near-solid colour. In both red and blue dogs, the most common are masks over one or both eyes, a white tip to the tail, a solid spot at the base of the tail, and sometimes solid spots on the body, though these are not desirable in dogs bred for conformation shows. Blue dogs can have tan midway up the legs and extending up the front to breast and throat, with tan on jaws, and tan eyebrows. Both colour forms can have a white \"star\" on the forehead called the \"Bentley Mark\", after a legendary dog owned by Tom Bentley. Common miscolours in the Australian Cattle Dog are black hairs in a red-coated dog, including the extreme of a black saddle on a red dog, and extensive tan on the face and body on a blue dog, called \"creeping tan\". The Cattle Dog has a double coat\u2014the short, straight outer guard hairs are protective in nature, keeping the elements from the dog's skin while the undercoat is short, fine and dense.\n\nThe mask consists of a black patch over one or both eyes (for the blue coat colour) or a red patch over one or both eyes (for the red coat colour). Depending on whether one or both eyes have a patch, these are called, respectively, \"single\" (or \"half\") mask and \"double\" (or \"full\") mask. Dogs without a mask are called plain-faced. Any of these are acceptable according to the breed standard. In conformation shows, even markings are preferred over uneven markings.\n\n\n==== Tail ====\nThe breed standards of the Australian, American and Canadian kennel clubs specify that the Australian Cattle Dog should have a natural, long, un-docked tail. There will often be a solid colour spot at the base of the tail and a white tip. The tail should be set moderately low, following the slope of the back. It should hang in a slight curve at rest, though an excited dog may carry its tail higher. The tail should feature a reasonable level of brush.In the United States, tails are sometimes docked on working stock. The tail is not docked in Australia, and serves a useful purpose in increasing agility and the ability to turn quickly. The Australian Cattle Dog is a breed distinct from the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog, a square-bodied dog born with a naturally \"bobbed\" tail. The Stumpy Tail resembles the Australian Cattle Dog, but has a taller, leaner conformation. It occasionally has a natural long thin tail, but most are born without tails.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nLike many working dogs, the Australian Cattle Dog has high energy levels, an active mind, and a level of independence. The breed ranks 10th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, rated as one of the most intelligent dogs ranked by obedience command trainability. The Cattle Dog needs plenty of exercise, companionship and a job to do, so a non-working dog might participate in dog sports, learning tricks, or other activities that engage its body and mind.When on home ground, the Australian Cattle Dog is an affectionate and playful pet. However, it is reserved with people it does not know and naturally cautious in new situations. Its attitude to strangers makes it an excellent guard dog when trained for this task, and it can be socialised to become accustomed to a variety of people from an early age as a family pet. It is good with older, considerate children, but will herd people by nipping at their heels, particularly younger children who run and squeal.  By the time puppies are weaned, they should have learned that the company of people is pleasurable, and that responding to cues from a person is rewarding. The bond that this breed can create with its owner is strong and will leave the dog feeling protective towards the owner, typically resulting in the dog's never being too far from the owner's side. The Australian Cattle Dog can be the friendliest of companions although it is quick to respond to the emotions of its owners, and may defend them without waiting for a command. The ACD was originally bred to move reluctant cattle by biting, and it will bite if treated harshly. The Australian Cattle Dog's protective nature and tendency to nip at heels can be dangerous as the dog grows into an adult if unwanted behaviours are left unchecked.While an Australian Cattle Dog generally works silently, it will bark in alarm or to attract attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking can be a sign of boredom or frustration, although research has shown that pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in a noisy environment. It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a pecking order can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives in a pack with other dogs.Data accumulated from Council reports in New South Wales from April to June 2013, showed that dogs identified as Australian Cattle Dogs were involved in 66 attacks, where an attack is defined as any incident where a dog rushes at, bites, harasses or chases any person or animal. Staffordshire Bull Terrier (155 attacks), German Shepherd (89) and American Staffordshire Terrier (88) were reported to be involved in more incidents. Expressed as a percentage of registered dogs, 0.1% of Australian Cattle Dogs were involved in attacks.  The data gathered in 2011\u20132012 listed the ACD twenty-seventh in involvement in incidents ranked by percentage of dogs registered.  A review of incidents in Melbourne where a dog bit, rushed at or chased a person or animal in a public space, found that there were sixty breeds involved and the German Shepherd and German Shepherd crosses, and Australian Cattle Dog and Cattle Dog crosses accounted for 9% of incidents.  Surveys of U.S. breed club members showed that both dog-directed aggression and stranger-directed aggression were higher in the ACD than the average of breeds studied, with dog-directed aggression being the more prevalent of the two aggression types. The American Temperament Test Society reports a test pass rate of 79.3% for Australian Cattle Dogs. The average pass rate for all breeds is 80.4%.\n\n\n== As pets ==\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\nKnown as a \"wash and wear\" dog, the Australian Cattle Dog requires little grooming, and an occasional brushing is all that is required to keep the coat clean and odour-free. Even for the show ring it needs no more than wiping down with a moist cloth. It is not a year-round shedder but blows its coat once a year (twice in the case of intact females) and frequent brushing and a warm bath during this period will contain the shedding hair. As with all dogs, regular attention to nails, ears and teeth will help avoid health problems.\n\n\n=== Training ===\nIn Katherine Buetow's guide to the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar makes the point that while people think of dog training as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that it is a good idea to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.\n\n\n=== Activities ===\n\nThe Australian Cattle Dog demands a high level of physical activity. Like many other herding dog breeds, the Cattle Dog has an active and fertile mind and if it is not given jobs to do it will find its own activities. It will appreciate a walk around the neighbourhood, but it needs structured activities that engage and challenge it, and regular interaction with its owner. While individual dogs have their own personalities and abilities, as a breed the Australian Cattle Dog is suited to any activity that calls for athleticism, intelligence, and endurance.Kennel club-sponsored herding trials with a range of events suit the driving abilities of the Cattle Dog and other upright breeds, while sheepdog trials are more suited to the \"eye\" breeds such as the Border Collie and Australian Kelpie. Herding instincts and trainability are measured at non-competitive herding tests, and basic commands are sometimes taught through herding games, where rules such as \"stay\", \"get it\" and \"that'll do\" are applied to fetching a ball or chasing a yard broom.The Australian Cattle Dog was developed for its ability to encourage reluctant cattle to travel long distances and may be the best breed in the world for this work. However, some working dog trainers have expressed concern that dogs bred for the show ring are increasingly too short in the legs and too stocky in the body to undertake the work for which they were originally bred.\n\nAmong the most popular activities for an Australian Cattle Dog is dog agility. It is ideally suited for navigating obstacle courses, since as a herding dog it is reactive to the handler's body language and willing to work accurately at a distance from the handler. Agility has been used by Cattle Dog owners to instil confidence in their dogs, and enhance their performance in training and competition.The Australian Cattle Dog thrives on change and new experiences, and many handlers find training the breed challenging for this reason. An Australian Cattle Dog can excel in obedience competition. It will enjoy the challenges, such as retrieving a scented article, but the breed's problem-solving ability may lead it to find solutions to problems that are not necessarily rewarded by the obedience judges. Rally obedience offers more interaction with the owner and less repetition than traditional obedience trials.Australian Cattle Dogs have been successful in a range of dog sports including weight pulling, flyball and schutzhund. The breed is particularly suited to activities that a dog can share with its owner such as canicross, disc dog, and skijoring or bikejoring. It is an effective hiking companion because of its natural endurance, its general lack of interest in hunting, and preference for staying by its owner's side. Most Australian Cattle Dogs love the water and are excellent swimmers. It is not a hyperactive breed, and once one has had its exercise, it is happy to lie at its owner's feet, or to rest in its bed or crate while keeping an ear and eye open for signs of pending activity. The Australian Cattle Dog is an adaptable dog that can accept city or indoor living conditions, if its considerable exercise and companionship needs are met.The Australian Cattle Dog can be put to work in a number of ways. Cattle Dogs are service dogs for people with a disability or are therapy dogs, some work for customs agencies in drug detection, some as police dogs, others haze pest animals, such as geese, for city or state agencies, and some work as scat-detection dogs, tracking endangered wildlife species.\n\n\n== Health and lifespan ==\n\n\n=== Lifespan ===\nIn a small sample of 11 deceased dogs, Australian Cattle Dogs had a median longevity of 11.7 years (maximum 15.9 yrs). A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean longevity of 13.41 years with a standard deviation of 2.36 years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13 years. There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey, born in 1910 and living for 29.5 years, but the record is unverified. Even if true, Bluey's record age would have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than as an indicator of common exceptional longevity for the entire breed. It remains, however, that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class. Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14 years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing and even their teeth until their final days.\n\n\n=== Common health problems ===\n\nThe Australian Cattle Dog carries recessive piebald alleles that produce white in the coat and skin and are linked to congenital hereditary deafness, though it is possible that there is a multi-gene cause for deafness in a dog with the piebald pigment genes. Around 2.4% of Cattle Dogs in one study were found to be deaf in both ears and 14.5% were deaf in at least one ear.The Australian Cattle Dog is one of the dog breeds affected by progressive retinal atrophy. It has the most common form, progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), a condition that causes the rods and cones in the retina of the eye to deteriorate later in life, resulting in blindness. PRCD is an autosomal recessive trait and a dog can be a carrier of the affected gene without developing the condition.Hip dysplasia is not common in the breed, although it occurs sufficiently often for many breeders to have their breeding stock tested. The Cattle Dog has a number of inherited conditions, but most of these are not common. Hereditary polioencephalomyelopathy of the Australian Cattle Dog is a very rare condition caused by an inherited biochemical defect. Dogs identified with the condition were completely paralysed within their first year. Based on a sample of 69 still-living dogs, the most common health issues noted by owners were musculoskeletal (spondylosis, elbow dysplasia, and arthritis) and reproductive (pyometra, infertility, and false pregnancy), and blindness. A study of dogs diagnosed at Veterinary Colleges in the United States and Canada over a thirty-year period described fractures, lameness and cruciate ligament tears as the most common conditions in the Australian Cattle Dogs treated.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== In Australia ===\n\nGeorge Hall and his family arrived in the New South Wales Colony in 1802. By 1825, the Halls had established two cattle stations in the Upper Hunter Valley, and had begun a northward expansion into the Liverpool Plains, New England and Queensland. Getting his cattle to the Sydney markets presented a problem in that thousands of head of cattle had to be moved for thousands of kilometres along unfenced stock routes through sometimes rugged bush and mountain ranges. A note, in his own writing, records Thomas Hall's anger at losing 200 head in scrub.A droving dog was needed, but the colonial working dogs are understood to have been of the Old English Sheepdog type, commonly referred to as Smithfields. Descendants of these dogs still exist, but are useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in Northumberland, his parents' home county. At that time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they constituted a breed as it is currently understood. In the manner of the time, the Hall family historian, A. J. Howard, gave these blue mottled dogs a name: Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.Thomas Hall crossed his Drovers Dogs with dingoes he had tamed, and by 1840 was satisfied with his resulting progeny. During the next thirty years, the Halls Heelers, as they became known, were used only by the Halls. Given that they were dependent on the dogs, which gave them an advantage over other cattle breeders, it is understandable that the dogs were not distributed beyond the Hall's properties. It was not until after Thomas Hall's death in 1870, when the properties went to auction with the stock on them, that Halls Heelers became freely available.\n\nBy the 1890s, the dogs had attracted the attention of the Cattle Dog Club of Sydney, a group of men with a recreational interest in the new practice of showing dogs competitively. None were stockmen working cattle on a daily basis, and initially they were interested in a range of working dogs, including the Smithfield. They reportedly adopted the term \"Australian Cattle Dog\" to refer to the dogs being bred from bloodlines originating from Thomas Hall's \"heelers\", and prominent members of the group concentrated on breeding these lines. Of these breeders, the Bagust family was the most influential. Robert Kaleski, of Moorebank, a young associate of Harry Bagust, wrote \"in 1893 when I got rid of my cross-bred cattle dogs and took up the blues, breeders of the latter had started breeding ... to fix the type. I drew up a standard for them on those lines\". This first breed standard for the Cattle Dog breed was published, with photographs, by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in 1903.Kaleski's standard was adopted by breed clubs in Queensland and New South Wales and re-issued as their own, with local changes. His writings from the 1910s give an important insight into the early history of the breed. However, dog breeder and author Noreen Clark has noted that his opinions are sometimes just that, and he introduces some contradictory assertions in his later writings, as well as some assumptions that are illogical in the light of modern science. Some of these have persisted; for example he saw the red colour form as having more dingo in it than the blue form, and there is a persistent belief that reds are more vicious than blues. The most enduring of Kaleski's myths relate to Dalmatian and Kelpie infusions into the early Cattle Dog breed. These infusions are not referred to in Kaleski's writings until the 1920s and it seems likely that Kaleski sought to explain the Cattle Dog's mottled colouration and tan on legs by similarity to the Dalmatian and Kelpie, respectively. The genetics of coat colour, and the current understanding of hereditary characteristics, make the infusion of Dalmatian to increase the cattle dog's tolerance of horses an extremely unlikely event. There were relatively few motor vehicles in Australia at the beginning of the 20th century, so most dogs of any breed would have been accustomed to horses. The Kelpie breed was developed after the Cattle Dog type was described, so its infusion is unlikely. It is possible that there was some infusion of Bull Terrier but there is no verifiable record of this, and the Cattle Dog has not had the Bull Terrier's instinct to bite and hold, which would have been an undesirable trait. Early in the 1900s there was considerable in-fighting amongst members of the Cattle Dog Club, and a series of arguments about the origin of the breed appeared in newspapers and journals of the time. While many of these arguments were misleading, some irrational, and the majority not supported by historical facts, they continue to be circulated, resulting in a number of theories on the origins of the breed. In recent years, information technology enabling the manipulation of large databases combined with advances in the understanding of canine genetics has allowed a clearer understanding of the development of the breed.\n\nThrough the 1890s, Cattle Dogs of Halls Heeler derivations were seen in the kennels of exhibiting Queensland dog breeders such as William Byrne of Booval, and these were a different population from those shown in New South Wales. Little Logic was bred in Rockdale, New South Wales, however Sydney exhibitors saw Little Logic for the first time after the dog had been added to the Hillview kennels of Arch Bevis in Brisbane. The show records of Little Logic and his offspring created a demand in New South Wales for Queensland dogs. By the end of the 1950s, there were few Australian Cattle Dogs whelped that were not descendants of Little Logic and his best known son, Logic Return. The success and popularity of these dogs led to the growth of the nickname \"Queensland Heeler\".The prominence of Little Logic and Logic Return in the pedigrees of modern Australian Cattle Dogs was perpetuated by Wooleston Kennels. For some twenty years, Wooleston supplied foundation and supplementary breeding stock to breeders in Australia, North America and Continental Europe. As a result, Wooleston Blue Jack is ancestral to most, if not all, Australian Cattle Dogs whelped since 1990 in any country.\n\n\n=== In the United States ===\n\nIn the 1940s Alan McNiven, a Sydney veterinarian, introduced Dingo, Kelpie, German Shepherd, and Kangaroo Hound into his breeding program; however, the Royal Agricultural Society Kennel Club (RASKC) would not register the cross breeds as Australian Cattle Dogs, even though McNiven argued they were true to conformation, colour and temperament. McNiven responded by giving his pups registration papers from dead dogs, and was consequently expelled from the RASKC and all of his dogs removed from the registry. Meanwhile, Greg Lougher, a Napa, California cattle rancher who met Alan McNiven while stationed in Australia during World War II, had imported several adults and several litters from McNiven. After his de-registration McNiven continued to export his \"improved\" dogs to the United States. Many U.S. soldiers who were stationed in Queensland or NSW during the War discovered the Australian Cattle Dog and took one home when they returned.In the late 1950s a veterinarian in Santa Rosa, California, Jack Woolsey, was introduced to Lougher's dogs. With his partners, he bought several dogs and started breeding them. The breeders advertised the dogs in Western Horsemen stating they were guaranteed to work and calling them Queensland Heelers. Woolsey imported several purebred Australian Cattle Dogs to add to his breeding program, including Oaklea Blue Ace, Glen Iris Boomerang and several Glen Iris bitches. The National Stock Dog Registry of Butler, Indiana, registered the breed, assigning American numbers without reference to Australian registrations.Australian Cattle Dogs had been classified in the \"miscellaneous\" category at the American Kennel Club (AKC) since the 1930s; to get the breed full recognition, the AKC required that a National Breed Parent Club be organised for promotion and protection of the breed. In 1967 Esther Ekman met Chris Smith-Risk at an AKC show, and the two fell into conversation about their Australian Cattle Dogs and the process of establishing a parent club for the breed. By 1969 the fledgling club had 12 members and formally applied to the AKC for instructions. One of the requirements was that the Club had to start keeping its own registry for the breed and that all dogs on the registry would have to be an extension of the Australian registry, tracing back to registered dogs in Australia. The AKC Parent Club members began researching their dogs, including exchanging correspondence with McNiven, and discovered that few of them had dogs that could be traced back to dogs registered in Australia. The AKC took over the club registry in 1979 and the breed was fully recognised in September 1980. The Australian Cattle Dog Club of America is still active in the promotion of the breed and the maintenance of breed standards. The National Stock Dog Registry continued to recognise Cattle Dogs without prerequisite links to Australian registered dogs, on the condition that any dog of unknown parentage that was presented for registry would be registered as an \"American Cattle Dog\", and all others would still be registered as \"Australian Cattle Dogs\".\n\n\n=== In Canada ===\nThe breed gained official recognition from the Canadian Kennel Club in January 1980 after five years of collecting pedigrees, gathering support, and lobbying officials by two breeders and enthusiasts. The small number of Australian Cattle Dogs in Canada at the time were primarily working dogs on farms and ranches scattered across large distances. However, the fledgling breed club held conformation shows, obedience and agility competitions, and entered their dogs in sports including flyball and lure coursing. At the end of 1980, Landmaster Carina was named the first Australian Cattle Dog in Canada to gain both her conformation and obedience titles.\n\n\n=== In the United Kingdom ===\nThe first registered Australian Cattle Dogs to arrive in the United Kingdom were two blue puppies, Lenthal Flinton and Lenthal Darlot, followed in 1980 by Landmaster Darling Red in whelp. Landmaster Darling Red was imported by John and Mary Holmes, and proved to be an outstanding brood bitch. Over the next few years additional Cattle Dogs arrived in the UK from the Netherlands, Kenya, Germany and Australia, although prior to relaxation of rules regarding artificial insemination, the UK gene pool was limited. In 1985 an Australian Cattle Dog Society was formed and officially recognised by the Kennel Club; before this they had to compete in the category \"Any Variety Not Separately Classified\". Australian Cattle Dogs were competing successfully in obedience and working trials in the UK during the 1980s.\n\n\n== Cross breeds ==\nThe Texas Heeler is a cross between the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd that was first registered with the Animal Research Foundation (ARF) in 1970. The ARF has registered Australian Cattle Dogs without papers as \"Australian Cattledog Queensland Heelers\" since 1965 and was the first organisation to recognise the Australian Shepherd. Although originally bred for its ability to work cattle, the Texas Heeler is increasingly used as a pet and a companion in dog sports. As with most cross breeds, the Texas Heeler's size and appearance is a variable combination of the parent breeds.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nAustralian Cattle Dog at Curlie"}, {"id": 36, "name": "Australian Kelpie", "country": "Australia", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog36", "description": "The Australian Kelpie, or simply Kelpie, is an Australian sheep dog successful at mustering and droving with little or no guidance. It is a medium-sized dog and comes in a variety of colours. The Kelpie has been exported throughout the world and is used to muster livestock, primarily sheep, cattle and goats.\nThe breed has been separated into two distinct varieties: the Show (or Bench) Kelpie and the Working Kelpie. The Show Kelpie is seen at conformation dog shows in some countries and is selected for appearance rather than working instinct, while the Working Kelpie is bred for working ability rather than appearance.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe ancestors of most kelpies were British dogs known loosely as collies (sometimes spelt colleys). These were mostly black ie dark brown dogs \u2013 hence the name collie, which has the same root as coal. (The official collie breeds were not formed until about ten or 15 years after the kelpie was established as a breed, and the first recognised border collie was not brought to Australia until after Federation in 1901.) Some collies were imported to Australia for stock work in the early 19th century, and were bred with other types of dogs \u2013 usually with an eye to working sheep without direct supervision. \nKelpies are partly descended from dingoes, with 3\u20134% of their genes coming from the native Australian dog. \nThere is no doubt that some kelpie breeders deliberately mated dingoes into the breed, and some sources have suggested that the best degree of admixture is one 32nd or one 16th, but kelpies with a quarter or half dingo ancestry have also become successful sheepdogs. The two breeds have become similar in conformation and colouring. As the dingo was regarded as a savage sheep killer from the earliest stages of European settlement in Australia, dog breeders were unlikely to admit the practice. At the time of the origin of the kelpie, it was illegal to keep dingoes as pets, and the owners of some dingoes and dingo crosses evidently registered their animals as kelpies.\nThe first dog known as a kelpie was a black and tan female pup with floppy ears bought by Jack Gleeson about 1872 from a litter born on Warrock Station near Casterton, owned by George Robertson, a Scot. This dog was named kelpie after the kelpie, a mythological shape shifting water spirit of Celtic folklore. Legend has it that \"Kelpie\" was sired by a dingo, but there is little evidence for or against this. In later years she was referred to as \"(Gleeson's) Kelpie\", to differentiate her from \"(King's) Kelpie\", her daughter.\nThe second \"Kelpie\" was \"(King's) Kelpie\", another black and tan bitch out of \"Kelpie\" by \"Caesar\", a pup from two sheepdogs imported from Scotland. However, challenges have been made that these two sheepdogs were not from Scotland and may have had dingo blood. \"(King's) Kelpie\" tied the prestigious Forbes Trial in 1879, and the strain was soon popularly referred to as \"Kelpie's pups\", or just Kelpies. The King brothers joined another breeder, McLeod, to form a dog breeding partnership whose dogs dominated trials during 1900 to 1920.An early Kelpie, Sally, was mated to Moss, a Smooth Collie, and she produced a black pup that was named Barb after The Barb, a black horse which had won the Melbourne Cup in 1866. Consequently, black Kelpies became known as Barb Kelpies or Barbs.There were a number of Kelpies named Red Cloud. The first and most famous was John Quinn's Red Cloud in the early 20th century. In the 1960s, another Red Cloud became well known in Western Australia. This started the tradition in Western Australia of calling all red or red and tan Kelpies, especially those with white chests, Red Cloud Kelpies. Other notable specimens include Gunner and Red Dog (c. 1971 \u2013 21 November 1979), a Kelpie mix which was the subject of a movie, Red Dog, released in 2011.\nKelpies have now been exported to many countries including Argentina, Canada, Italy, Korea, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States for various pursuits.\n\nBy 1990, Kelpies have been trained as scent dogs with good success rates. In Sweden they are widely used for tracking and rescue work.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Kelpie is a soft-coated, medium-sized dog, generally with prick ears and an athletic appearance. Coat colours include black, black and tan, red, red and tan, blue, blue and tan, fawn, fawn and tan, cream, black and blue, and white and gold. The Kelpie generally weighs 14\u201320 kg (31\u201344 lb) and measures 41\u201351 cm (16\u201320 in) at the withers.\n\n\n=== Breed standards ===\nRobert Kaleski published the first standard for the Kelpie in 1904. The standard was accepted by leading breeders of the time and adopted by the Kennel Club of New South Wales. Contemporary breed standards vary depending on whether the registry is for working or show Kelpies. It is possible for a dog to both work and show, but options for competition in conformation shows might be limited depending on ancestry and the opinions of the kennel clubs or breed clubs involved.\nIn Australia, there are two separate registries for Kelpies.Working Kelpies are registered with the Working Kelpie Council (WKC) and/or the Australian Sheepdog Workers Association. The WKC encourages breeding for working ability, and allows a wide variety of coat colours. Show Kelpies are registered with the Australian National Kennel Council, which encourages breeding for a certain appearance and limits acceptable colours. The wide standards allowed by the WKC mean that Working Kelpies do not meet the standard for showing.\nIn the US, the Kelpie is not recognised as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC). However, the United Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel Club recognise the Kelpie and allow them to compete in official events. As of 2015, Australian Kelpies have been accepted by the AKC as Herding Dogs allowed to compete in AKC sanctioned Sheep Herding Trials.\n\n\n=== Working Kelpie ===\n\nThe Working Kelpie comes in three coat types: short, smooth and rough. The coat can be almost every colour from black through light tan or cream. Some Kelpies have a white blaze on the chest, and a few have white points. Kelpies sometimes have a double coat, which sheds out in spring in temperate climates. Agouti is not unusual, and can look like a double coat.\nWorking Kelpies vary in size, ranging from about 19\u201325 in (48\u201364 cm) and 28\u201360 lb (13\u201327 kg).  The dog's working ability is unrelated to appearance, so stockmen looking for capable working dogs disregard the dog's appearance.\nA Working Kelpie can be a cheap and efficient worker that can save farmers and graziers the cost of several hands when mustering livestock. The good working Kelpies are herding dogs that will prevent stock from moving away from the stockman. This natural instinct is crucial when mustering stock in isolated gorge country, where a good dog will silently move ahead of the stockman and block up the stock (usually cattle) until the rider appears. The preferred dogs for cattle work are Kelpies, often of a special line, or a Kelpie cross.  They will drive a mob of livestock long distances in extremes of climates and conditions. Kelpies have natural instincts for managing livestock. They will work sheep, cattle, goats, pigs, poultry, and other domestic livestock. The Kelpie's signature move is to jump on the backs of sheep and walk across the tops of the sheep to reach the other side and break up the jam. A good working Kelpie is a versatile dog\u2014they can work all day on the farm, ranch, or station, and trial on the weekends. Kelpies compete and are exhibited in livestock working trials, ranging from yards or arenas to large open fields working sheep, goats, cattle, or ducks.\n\n\n=== Show Kelpies ===\nShow Kelpies are restricted to solid colours (black, chocolate, red, smoky blue, fawn, black and tan, red and tan) in a short double coat with pricked ears. It was during the early 20th century that Kelpies were first exhibited, at the Sydney Royal Easter Show. Different kennel clubs' breed standards have preferences for certain colours. Show Kelpies are generally heavier and shorter than working Kelpies.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nShow Kelpies generally excel in agility trials and may be shown in conformation in Australia.\n\n\n== Health ==\nKelpies are a hardy breed with few health problems, but they are susceptible to disorders common to all breeds, like cryptorchidism, hip dysplasia, cerebellar abiotrophy and luxating patella. Current research is underway to find the genetic marker for cerebellar abiotrophy in the breed.\n\n\n== Show coat colours ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nAustralian Cattle Dog\nAustralian Shepherd\nAustralian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog\nKoolie\nSheep husbandry\nWorking Group (dogs)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHartnagle-Taylor, Jeanne Joy; Taylor, Ty (2010).

There is disagreement regarding the exact history of the breed prior to its arrival in the United States, and thus no official consensus on the origin of its name or association with Australia.They are similar in appearance to the popular English Shepherd and Border Collie breeds, and research has found that Australian Shepherds and Border Collies are closely related to each other; both the Border Collie and Australian Shepherd are slightly more distantly related to other kinds of Collies and to Shetland Sheepdogs.Australian Shepherds rose in popularity with a boom in Western riding after World War II. They became known to the general public through rodeos, horse shows, and Disney movies made for television.\nFor many years, Aussies have been valued by stockmen for their versatility and trainability. While they continue to work as stock dogs and compete in herding trials, they have earned recognition in other roles due to their trainability and eagerness to please and are highly regarded for their skills in obedience. Like all working breeds, Aussies have considerable energy and drive and usually need a job to keep them occupied. They often excel at dog sports such as dog agility and frisbee and are also highly successful as search and rescue dogs, disaster dogs, detection dogs, guide dogs, service dogs, and therapy dogs. They are considered the 17th-most popular dog breed in the United States.\n\n\n== Physical traits ==\n\n\n=== Size ===\nThe Australian Shepherd is traditionally a medium-sized breed of solid build. They can weigh from 30 to 65 pounds (14 to 29 kg) and stand from 17 to 26 inches (43 to 66 cm) in height. The Australian Shepherd Club of America (ASCA) standard calls for the Australian shepherd to stand between 18 and 23 inches (46 and 58 cm) at the withers, females being 18 to 21 inches (46 to 53 cm) and males measuring 20 to 23 inches (51 to 58 cm); however, quality is not to be sacrificed in favor of size.\n\n\n=== Color ===\nRecognized Aussie colors are solid black, solid red (liver), blue merle, and red/liver merle; each of these colors may also have copper (tan) points or white markings in various combinations on the face, chest, and legs. A black or red dog with copper and white trim is called 'tricolor' or 'tri', while a black or red dog with white trim but no copper is called 'bicolor' or 'bi'. White, rather than pigment, on or around the ears is an indicator of increased risk for white-related deafness. Excessive white on the face and ears can place an individual dog at greater risk for sunburn and subsequent skin cancer.\nThe wide variety of color combinations comes from the interaction between the color allele, which is either black (B) dominant or red (b) recessive, and the dominant merle allele (M). Together, these provide four coat-color aspects that can appear in any combination:\nBlack, with copper points, white markings, or both on the face, collar, legs, chest, underbelly - solid black dogs are equally desirable as ones with copper or white.\nRed (liver) with or without copper points or white markings on the face, collar, legs, chest, underbelly - either white or copper points are required. Solid red dogs are equally desirable as ones with copper or white.\nBlue merle (a mottled patchwork of gray and black) with or without copper points or white markings on the face, collar, legs, chest, underbelly - neither white nor copper points are required. Solid merle dogs are equally desirable as ones with copper or white.\nRed merle (a mottled patchwork of cream and red/liver) with or without copper points or white markings on the face, collar, legs, chest, underbelly - neither white nor copper points are required. Solid merle dogs are equally desirable as ones with copper or white.The merle allele, which produces a mingled or patchwork combination of dark and light areas, is the coat pattern most commonly associated with the breed. This merle (M) is dominant, so heterozygous dogs (Mm) show the pigmentation pattern; however, when two merles are bred, the statistical risk is 25% of the offspring will end up with the two copies of the merle gene (homozygous). These dogs usually have a mostly white coat and blue irises, and are often deaf, blind, or both. In this case, the deafness and blindness are linked to having two copies of the merle gene, which disrupts pigmentation and produces these health defects.All black and blue merle dogs have black noses, eye rims, and lips. All red and red merle dogs have liver or brown noses, eye rims, and lips.\n\nAlso, great variety is seen in the Aussie's eye color, and they are often heterochromatic. An early nickname for the breed was \"ghost-eye dog\". Aussie eyes may be any shade of brown, or blue; they may have two differently colored eyes, or even have bicolored or \"split eyes\" (for example, a half-brown, half-blue eye), which appear to be linked to the merle coloration. Merled eyes occur, as well, where one color is mixed in and swirled with another. Any combination of eye color is acceptable in the breed standard, so long as the eyes are healthy. In general, however, black Aussies (self, bi-color, or tri-color) tend to have brown eyes, while red (self, bi-color, or tri-color) Aussies tend to have amber eyes, though these Aussies may also carry the blue-eyed gene.\nThe merle phenotype in Australian Shepherds is very similar to the coat color in Mitf mouse mutants.\n\n\n=== Tail ===\nAlthough some Aussies are born with naturally bobbed or partially bobbed (stubby) tails, the majority are born with full, long tails. Breeders have historically docked the tails when the puppies are born.  Docking working dogs' tails has become a tradition with the goal of preventing injury.  It can also be seen as a way to increase speed and improve hygiene (the Aussie's long-haired tail can become easily matted and soiled). In the United States and Canada, the standard calls for a natural bob or docked tail not to exceed four inches as a defining characteristic; however, some long-tailed examples have been successfully shown and been given recognition. Any natural tail length is permitted when showing in Europe, where docking has been banned in most countries, including the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe breed is typically highly energetic, requiring a great deal of exercise and attention. An Australian Shepherd enjoys working, whether it is learning and practicing tricks, competing in dog agility, or engaging in any other physically and mentally involving activity.Dogs may show reserved and cautious guarding behaviors. They are kind, loving, and devoted to those they know. They are very loyal to their owners, and are rewarding dogs if treated well. Because the breed was developed to serve on the ranch, a job which includes being protective of its property, it is inclined to bark warnings about neighborhood activity.\nIt is not inclined toward obsessive barking.\nThe Aussie is intelligent, learns quickly, and loves to play. This means that a bored, neglected, unexercised Aussie may invent its own games, activities, and jobs, which to a busy owner might appear to be hyperactivity: for example, an Aussie may go from being at rest to running at top speed for several \"laps\" around the house before returning to rest. Without something to amuse them, Aussies can become destructive. Aussies also do best with plenty of human companionship: they are often called \"Velcro dogs\" for their strong desire to always be near their owners and for their tendency to form intense, devoted bonds with select people.The Australian Shepherd has a reputation as a highly intelligent and versatile stock dog with a range of working styles. A good working Aussie is quick, thoughtful, and easy with its stock: there are working lines in the American West that still herd sheep, smaller cattle, and goats.  They are fast runners with a loose eye style of working livestock.  The ability for the breed to adapt to the situation and to think for itself makes it an excellent all-around worker. For this reason, the Aussie is often chosen to work unusual livestock such as ducks, geese, and commercially raised rabbits.\nThese dogs require a minimum of two to three hours a day of play, exercise, and attention. They thrive in rural, ranch-like conditions, and need space to run and play in an urban setting. The Australian Shepherd is a high-spirited dog, that requires much attention and work. Teaching them tricks keeps them focused and happy, which also keeps their minds working. The breed also has great stamina and can live in a variety of terrain. Because of this, they are  popularly used as trail and working dogs.Australian Shepherds need roughly 30-60 minutes of exercise each day. They do not adapt well to apartment living.\n\n\n== Health ==\nAustralian Shepherds are generally a pretty healthy breed, but they can have several health problems. Vision problems are common, and  epilepsy is also a concern. In merle-to-merle breeding, the puppies that have inherited two copies of the merle gene have an increased risk of being born blind or deaf.Australian Shepherds are the most common dog breed to acquire Epilepsy.\n\n\n=== Feeding ===\nThe recommended amount of food an Australian Shepherd should eat is 1-1/2 to 2 cups of dry food a day, But size, exercise level, and age should be considered. With proper diet and exercise, the Australian Shepherd can stay in good shape.\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\nAustralian Shepherds have a medium-length, water-resistant coat. With the coat being somewhat long and wavy or curly, this breed does shed, mostly in the spring to get rid of the winter coat. The shepherd should be brushed weekly to maintain a healthy and clean coat and also to prevent matting. Being a \"working dog\", this breed should be outside to get its needed exercise. If a dog is dirty, a basic bath can be given, but not frequently, for it can dry out the skin and coat.\n\n\n=== Mortality ===\nThe median lifespans for breeds similar in size to Australian Shepherds are mostly between 11 and 13 years, so, assuming the results of the UK study are not representative of the population there, Aussies appear to have a typical lifespan for a breed their size.\nResults of a 1998 internet survey with a sample size of 614 Australian Shepherds indicated a median longevity around 12.5 years, but that longevity may be declining.\n\n\n=== Morbidity ===\nBased on a sample of 48 still-living dogs, the most common health concerns noted by owners were eye problems (red eye, epiphora, conjunctivitis, and cataracts).  Dermatological and respiratory problems also ranked high.\nCollie eye anomaly (CEA) is rare in the breed, but it and cataracts are a concern in Aussies. Other conditions of note include iris coloboma, canine hip dysplasia, Pelger-Huet anomaly, hypothyroidism, and nasal solar dermatitis. Prior to breeding, the Aussie should be checked for hip and elbow dysplasia and DNA tests performed to show the dog to be free of the MDR1 mutation, cataract mutation, and CEA. Tests should also include those for thyroidism and clearances for other known eye diseases like colobomas, progressive retinal atrophy, and retinal folds.\nSome Australian Shepherds (as well as Collies, German Shepherds, and many other herding dogs) are susceptible to a genetic mutation of the MDR1 gene. Dogs with the mutation can suffer toxicity from antiparasitics such as ivermectin in high doses, and other drugs.  A test is available to determine if a particular dog carries the mutated gene.\n\n\n=== Hip dysplasia ===\nHip dysplasia is a heritable condition where the femur does not fit securely in the pelvic socket of the hip joint. This problem can exist with or without clinical signs, meaning some dogs feel pain in one or both rear legs.\n\n\n=== Double merle ===\n\nDouble merle or homozygous merle occurs when the offspring of two merled parents inherit two copies of the dominant merle gene. The odds of this are 25% for each pup born from such a litter. Double merles often have excessive white and can have hearing and vision problems as a result of having two copies of the merle gene. Homozygous merles can be deaf or blind, or express iris colobomas and microphthalmia. Not all homozygous merles are affected, but most are, making the breeding of two merles a very touchy subject. Some breeders euthanize mostly white pups, while others may attempt to sell them as \"rare\" white Aussies without disclosing the potential for health defects. A large percentage of homozygous merles sold eventually end up in rescue and shelters, as the average family is ill-prepared to take on a deaf or blind pet. However, deaf or blind Australian shepherds can make wonderful pets given a home prepared for their special needs. They are an intelligent breed, which generally learn hand signals with ease.\nThe term \"lethal white\" originated from horses born with lethal white syndrome, and has since evolved to often describe dogs born with the double merle trait. This trait is found in many breeds, but most commonly found in Australian Shepherds. The name \"lethal white\" is a misnomer, as this genetic condition is not lethal to the dogs; it is often the breeder who is lethal to the pups by culling them immediately after birth. Many consider the term \"lethal white\" to be derogatory.\n\n\n== Available health tests ==\nMany diagnostic tests are available for concerned Aussie owners to check the overall health of a dog. Also, the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) has an extensive database to track results and provide statistics for these concerns: hips, elbows, heart, patellar luxation (knees), and thyroid (autoimmune) disease. The OFA database also includes the results for eye exams performed by a Canine Eye Registration Foundation  veterinarian, but only if the owner of the Aussie submits the results. This database is a great resource to investigate the lineage and related health of the progenitors of some dogs, at least regarding hip ratings.\nMany tests have been developed by, or are processed at, laboratories to check for the 11 health concerns that plague the Australian Shepherd breed. Some of those labs are Optigen, Animal Health Trust, Endocrine Diagnostic Center, Animal Health Laboratory, Washington State University Veterinary Clinic, Vet DNA Center, and HealthGene. These labs might perform one or many of the tests that have been developed.\nTests or evaluations have been developed for:\n\nHip and elbow dysplasia\nPatellar luxation (knees)\nEyes\nCollie eye anomaly\nProgressive retinal atrophy\nThyroid (autoimmune) \u2013 multiple labs perform this test-check OFA application for list\nCongenital Cardiac (heart)\nMultidrug resistance gene\nHereditary cataracts\nPelger Huet anomalyOther areas that are currently not health concerns, but tests have been developed for, are:\n\nCoat color (red carrier/red factored) \u2013 Vet DNA Center and HealthGene process this sample\nDilute gene carrier \u2013 Vet DNA Center and HealthGene process this sampleDNA testing to either certify parentage or to verify parentage) for Australian Shepherds can be performed, and as of January 2010, all adults producing a litter will be required to be DNA tested to allow a breeder to register a litter with the Australian Shepherd Club of America (ASCA).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Australian Shepherd's history is vague, as is the reason for its misleading name.  The breed was initially called by many names, including Spanish Shepherd, Pastor Dog, Bob-Tail, New Mexican Shepherd, California Shepherd, and Austrian Shepherd.  It is believed by some that the breed has Basque origins in Spain and was used there by shepherds. Those shepherds might then have emigrated to the West Coast of the United States via Australia. What is known is that it developed in western North America in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Australian Shepherd was a particularly tireless sheep herder in the Rocky Mountains because it is relatively unaffected by altitude.  Ranchers in Boulder, Colorado, began breeding the dogs which would attract purchasers from as far west as California for their legendary sheep-herding abilities.  A theory suggests that they were named for the imported sheep that they herded.  It is also possible that many of the dogs coming from Australia were blue merle and the adjective \"Australian\" became associated with any dogs of that coat color.Breeds as we know them today did not exist before Victorian times, but local variations of the ancestors of current breeds came into America along with their owners and livestock. Included are some that are now extinct or that have merged into other breeds. These may have included some British herding dogs, native dogs from North America (originating in Asia/Siberia), as well as dogs from Germany and Spain including the Carea Leon\u00e9s. For many centuries, shepherds were more interested in dogs' working abilities than their appearance. As a result, over time, shepherds interbred dogs that they believed would produce better workers for the given climate and landscape. In the eastern U.S., terrain and weather conditions were similar to that of Europe, so the existing imported breeds and their offspring worked well there.In the American West, conditions were quite different. Spanish flocks were introduced for food and fiber which was mainly the Churra. The Spanish dogs that accompanied them to American West proved well-suited for their job in the wild and dangerous territory.  They were highly valued for their ability to herd and protect their charges from predators on the open range. In the arid and semiarid areas inhabited by early Spanish settlers, temperatures reached extremes of hot and cold and fields varied in altitude from sea level to the higher, rougher Sierra Nevada and similar mountain ranges. The ranchers in these areas often pastured livestock on remote ranges. They preferred more aggressive herding dogs that served in the capacity of herder and guardian.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nDevelopment of the breed began in the American West. The breed's foundation bloodlines are depicted in the Australian Shepherd Genealogy Chart showing the relationship between the early families of dogs. The American Kennel Club (AKC) ranked the Australian Shepherd as the 17th-most popular breed in the United States in 2016.Selective breeding for many generations focused on aspects of the dog that enabled it to function as an effective stockdog in the American West. It had to handle severe weather; have plenty of speed, athleticism, energy, and endurance; and be intelligent, flexible, and independent; while remaining obedient. The actual foundation for the Australian Shepherd was established between the 1940s and the early 1970s, when the Australian Shepherd Club of America was formed and the registry was started.Their stunts and skills earned them places in several Disney films, including Run Appaloosa Run and Stub: The Greatest Cowdog in the West. An Australian shepherd was featured in the film Flight of the Navigator (1986) and the TV series Flash Forward (1996). More recently, an Australian Shepherd starred in the film Famous Five (2012) and its sequels.\n\nIn June 2017, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and his family adopted a Blue Merle Australian Shepherd named Harley. \n\n\n== Activities ==\n\nLike other herding breeds, these dogs excel at many dog sports, especially herding, dog agility, frisbee, and flyball. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive instinct tests. Aussies that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in ASCA stock dog trials or AKC herding events.The dog has a stride in which its front and back legs cross over, making for an appearance of \"on the edge\" speed. The dogs instinctively use a \"pounce\" position to deal with cattle trying to kick them. They also have strong hips and legs, allowing for fast acceleration and high jumping, sometimes as high as 4 ft (1.3 m).\n\nAn Australian shepherd named Pockets is credited as being the oldest dog to earn a title in AKC history, having earned the Rally Novice title at the age of 15 years, 5 weeks.\n\n\n== Miscellaneous ==\nThe Australian Shepherd Club of America (ASCA) was founded in 1957 to promote the breed. The National Stock Dog Registry became its official breed registry, which continued until ASCA took over in 1972.In 1975, ASCA created a breed standard, describing exactly how an Australian shepherd should look and be constructed (its conformation to the Standard). It developed more uniformity in the breed and standardized the type.\nIn the United States, the American Kennel Club (AKC) is the primary registry for purebred dogs, and first recognized the Australian Shepherd in 1991 as a member of the Herding group. However, many Aussie breeders felt the AKC put too much emphasis on breed conformity and not enough on performance, so the ASCA declined to join the AKC. Those breeders who felt that AKC membership had its advantages split off from ASCA to form their own Australian Shepherd club, the United States Australian Shepherd Association, created their own breed standard, and joined the AKC in 1993. The decision about affiliation with the AKC remains controversial, as it does with many performance breeds.\nThe F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI-World Canine Organization) recognized the Australian Shepherd for international competition in 2007, in Group 1 Sheepdogs and Cattle Dogs as breed number 342.\nThe Miniature Australian Shepherd was developed by breeders looking for smaller dogs ranging in size from 14 inches to the Aussie standard. In 2010, NAMASCUSA renamed the breed Miniature American Shepherds and subsequently changed their name to MASCUSA, The Miniature American Shepherd Club of the USA. This new breed gained acceptance into the AKC Miscellaneous class in June 2012 with the sizes written in the standard as females from 13\u201317 inches and males from 14\u201318 inches.\nIn addition, an emergence of an even smaller version occurred, referred to as the Toy Australian Shepherd, with adult males weighing 12\u201315 pounds (5.5\u20137 kg) and all dogs falling under a 14-inch height at the withers. Many breeders and owners of Australian Shepherds consider the Mini and Toy to be separate breeds; others consider them to be down-sized versions of the same breed. While the Mini size can be attained through selective breeding of small Australian Shepherds, the Toy size is typically a result of cross breeding with other toy breeds. ASCA and AKC consider both variants to be separate breeds.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAustralian Cattle Dog\nAustralian Kelpie\nBorder Collie\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHartnagle, Carol Ann; Hartnagle, Ernest (2006).

The breed was developed in Australia, although the ancestral types and breeds were from Great Britain. It is closely related to the Australian Terrier and the Yorkshire Terrier. The breed is called the Silky Terrier in North America, but is called the Australian Silky Terrier in its country of origin and in the rest of the world.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Australian Silky Terrier is a small and compact short-legged terrier, 23 to 26 cm (9.1 to 10.2 in) at the withers, alert and active. The long silky grey and white or blue and tan coat is an identifying feature, hanging straight and parted along the back, and described as \"flat, fine and glossy\". All proportions and aspects of the body and head as well as desirable shades of grey and white and placement of markings are extensively described in the breed standard.The Silky Terrier should be slightly longer than tall (about one fifth longer than the height at withers). This is a dog that was historically used for hunting and killing rodents and snakes, so its body should have enough substance to fit this role. The coat requires quite a lot of regular grooming and shampooing to retain its silkiness.\nThe Silky Terrier has a strong, wedge-shaped head. The eyes are small and almond-shaped. According to the standards, light-colored eyes are considered a fault. The ears are small and carried erect. The Silky Terrier has a high-set tail and small, almost catlike, feet. The coat should be long, but not so long to approach floor length. The hair on the face and ears is normally cut.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe ancestors of the Australian Silky Terrier include the Yorkshire Terrier and the Australian Terrier (which descends from the rough coated type terriers brought from Great Britain to Australia in the early 19th century); few records indicate whether early dogs were just Australian Terriers born with silky fur, or whether there was an attempt to create a separate breed. According to the American Kennel Club, the breed began at the end of the 19th century when were crossed with the Australian Terriers. At first the breed was known as the Sydney Silky, as it was found primarily in the city of Sydney, Australia. Although most other Australian breeds were working dogs, the Silky Terrier was bred primarily to be an urban pet and companion, although it is also known for killing snakes in Australia.Up until 1929 the Australian Terrier, the Australian Silky Terrier, and the Yorkshire Terrier were not clearly defined. Dogs of three different breeds might be born in the same litter, to be separated by appearance into the different types once they were grown. After 1932 in Australia, further crossbreeding was discouraged, and in 1955 the breed's name officially became the Australian Silky Terrier. The breed was recognised by the Australian National Kennel Council in 1958 in the Toy Group.During and after World War II American servicemen that had been stationed in Australia brought back to the United States a few Silky Terriers. Newspaper photographs of the breed in 1954 caused an upsurge of popularity and hundreds of Silkies were imported from Australia to the United States. The American Kennel Club recognised the breed as the Silky Terrier in 1959, as did the United Kennel Club (US) in 1965 where it is shown as a Terrier; it is also recognised as the Silky Terrier by the Canadian Kennel Club. The breed is recognised by all the major kennel clubs in the English speaking world, and internationally by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale as breed number 236. It may also be recognised by various minor kennel clubs and internet breed registry businesses.\n\n\n=== Breed Groups ===\nThe Australian Silky Terrier is a terrier, but is usually placed in the Toy Group rather than the Terrier Group due to its small size. As breed groupings are done mostly to organise groups of breeds for dog shows, it is safer for the little dogs to be with others their own size, rather than with larger dogs. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale has a special Section of the Terrier Group that includes only the smallest dogs, while other kennel clubs place the breed in the Toy Group, but universally everyone agrees that the breed's type is Terrier.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe breed standard describe the ideal Australian Silky Terrier temperament as keenly alert and active. They love to be given chances to run and play, but must have a tightly fenced yard. They also enjoy brisk walks and playing ball. The Silky is able to do well in an apartment, although they are also an active indoor breed. It is important they are kept busy and social to discourage boredom. In a recent survey reported  (on Dogs 101) of 91 small breed dogs (16 inches and under 22 lbs) the Silky Terrier was ranked in the top 20 in learning the quickest.\nThe Silky Terrier is described as the best of both worlds temperament-wise. They love to sit on laps and do \"toy dog\" things but have an easy going more laid back Terrier personality ready for just about any activity.\n\n\n== Care ==\nThe Silky Terrier's coat is highly susceptible to tangles and matting and requires daily brushing and combing. This breed requires a deep commitment from the owners. To keep the coat lustrous, regular shampooing is necessary. Using an Avocado and Oatmeal Shampoo will help alleviate the itchy, dry skin of this breed.\nThis particular breed should be taken to a groomer every three weeks; its teeth should be brushed while there. Terriers are known to have teeth and gum problems. Care should also be taken with grooming near the neck area and a harness leash should be used to protect the Silky Terrier from tracheal collapse.\n\n\n== See also ==\nYorkshire Terrier\nAustralian Terrier\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHistory, Origins and Development of the Australian Silky Terrier George Holmes.

The Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog was developed in Australia  to herd cattle, and descends from crosses between European herding dogs and the Australian dingo. The name is spelled both with hyphenation, as Australian Stumpy-Tail Cattle Dog, and without, and the shorter name Stump Tail Cattle Dog is also sometimes applied.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog descended from Smithfield herding dogs of England, which were brought to Australia in the early 19th century and cross-bred with the dingo. Records of working dogs are scarce from this time period, and there are differing accounts of the breed's development. One is that a drover named Timmins from Bathurst, New South Wales, crossed the Smithfield dogs with dingoes, producing a type of working dog called Timmins' Biters. In order to mute their dingo characteristics and make the dogs easier to handle, further crosses were made with Scottish Smooth Collies, producing speckled red and blue dogs that were often born tailless.\nIn the book A Dog Called Blue, author Noreen Clark makes the case that both the tailless Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog and the Australian Cattle Dog (a.k.a. \"Queensland Heeler\") descended at one point from the same stock, called Halls Heelers, kept in the 1830s by a very large cattle operation run by Thomas Hall. The dogs were also crosses of Smithfield dogs and dingoes, but the breeds diverged at some point in the late 20th century. Selective breeding of the tailless or short-tailed dogs has fixed the characteristic of today's breed.\n\n\n== Breed recognition ==\nThe Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog has been recognised as a standardised breed since 1988 in its native country by the Australian National Kennel Council, in its \"Group 5 (Working Dogs)\". It is also recognised by the nearby New Zealand Kennel Club in its \"Working\" group.More internationally, the breed was provisionally accepted by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 2005, as breed standard 351, in \"Group 1, Section 2: Cattle Dogs (Except Swiss Cattle Dogs)\".  As of  2010, it is also recognised as simply the Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog by the US United Kennel Club (in its \"Herding Dog Breeds\" group) since 1996, and by the longer name in the Canadian Kennel Club (in its \"Group VII: Herding Dogs\"), but not by The Kennel Club (UK), nor by the American Kennel Club.The breed may also be listed by minor kennel clubs, working or herding dog clubs, or Internet-based dog registry businesses, and promoted as a rare breed pet.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog is a normally proportioned, rugged dog with pricked (standing up) ears and long legs. The breed's most distinctive feature, for which the breed is named, is the frequent lack of a tail. When there is a tail, it is quite short, no longer than 10 cm (4 in.), and undocked. The coat is medium length to short, straight, dense and harsh. The coat color is a speckled red or speckled blue..Stumpy Tail Cattle Dogs do not show brown points or markings as seen on the ACD. Height is  46\u201351 centimetres (18\u201320 in) at the withers for dogs, with females slightly smaller. The Australian Cattle Dog (a.k.a. \"Queensland Heeler\") (with a long tail) is similar in appearance to the Stumpy, but the Australian Cattle Dog is proportionally heavier, less leggy and has brown points and markings. (See the article Dog terminology for an explanation of terms.)\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe ideal temperament of the Stumpy is described in the breed standard as alert and watchful, as well as responsive to its owner and reserved around strangers, but also notes that \"it must be amenable to handling\" at shows. All working dogs need early socialisation with people, and consistent training and activity throughout their lives.                                                                                                                                                     \n\n\n== Activities ==\nStumpy Tail Cattle Dogs can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, frisbee and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. \"Stumpies\" exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnatomical terms of location\nDog terminology\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAustralian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog at Curlie"}, {"id": 40, "name": "Australian Terrier", "country": "Australia", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog40", "description": "The Australian Terrier is a small breed of dog of the terrier dog type. The breed was developed in Australia, although the ancestral types of dogs from which the breed descends were from Great Britain.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Australian Terrier is a small dog with short legs, weighing around 6.5 kilograms (14 lb) and standing about 25 centimetres (9.8 in) at the withers, with a medium length shaggy harsh double coat that is not normally trimmed. Fur is shorter on the muzzle, lower legs, and feet, and there is a ruff around the neck. The coat colours are blue or silver and tan with a lighter coloured topknot, and with markings on face, ears, body and legs of a colour described in the breed standard as \"tan, never sandy\", or a solid red with a sandy variation. The tail was traditionally docked, in order to protect the dog from spinal injury while working and hunting in the field. As with most pet dog breeds, all proportions and aspects of the body and head as well as colours and markings are extensively described in the breed standard.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Australian Terrier is descended from the rough coated type terriers brought from Great Britain to Australia in the early 19th century. The ancestral types of all of these breeds were kept to eradicate mice and rats.  The Australian Terrier shares ancestors with the Cairn Terrier, Shorthaired Skye Terrier, and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier; Yorkshire Terriers and Irish Terriers were also crossed into the dog during the breed's development.Development of the breed began in Australia about 1820, and the dogs were at first called the Rough Coated Terrier. The breed was officially recognised in 1850, and later renamed as the Australian Terrier in 1892. The Australian Terrier was shown at a dog show for the first time in 1906 in Melbourne, and was also shown in Great Britain about the same time. The Kennel Club (UK) recognised the breed in 1933. The American Kennel Club recognised the Australian Terrier in 1960, and the United Kennel Club (US) in 1970. It is now recognised by all of the kennel clubs in the English speaking world, and also is listed by various minor kennel clubs and other clubs and registries.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThere are three completed health surveys for Australian Terriers.  Two surveys, one in 1997 and one in 2002, have been conducted by the Australian Terrier Club of America. The Club is currently collecting data for their next survey.  \nThe UK Kennel Club has a 2004 survey, but it has a much smaller sample size than the Australian Terrier Club of America surveys.  Some of the respondents in the American surveys were from Australia, but there is no separate Australian health survey.\n\n\n== Mortality ==\nIn both 1997 and 2002 Australian Terrier Club of America surveys, median longevity of Australian Terriers was 11 years (total sample size of 230 deceased dogs).  In the Kennel Club (UK) 2004 survey, median longevity was 12.1 years, but the sample size was only 11 deceased dogs.  11 years is a typical median longevity for purebred dogs in general, but on the low end of longevities for breeds similar in size to Australian Terriers.Major causes of death in the 2002 survey were cancer (67%), old age (17%), undetermined (16%), and diabetes (13%).\n\n\n== Morbidity ==\nAmong 619 living dogs in the 2002 Australian Terrier Club of America survey, the most commonly reported health problems were endocrine (primarily diabetes), allergic dermatitis, and musculoskeletal (primarily luxating patella and ruptured cranial cruciate ligament).  Other conditions reported among more than 4% of the surveyed dogs were adult onset cataracts and ear infections.  The much smaller 2004 UKC survey, with 28 living dogs, suggested similar health concerns.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe breed standard describes the ideal Australian Terrier temperament as spirited, alert, \"with the natural aggressiveness of a ratter and hedge hunter\". Aussies  rank 34th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of above average \"Working and Obedience\" intelligence, indicating good trainability. They tend to get along well with other dogs, although some males may not get along well with other males in the house. An Australian Terrier should never start a fight, but they will not back down from an attacker. Since the Australian Terrier was also bred for companionship, they tend to be very people friendly, and enjoy interacting with people. They are especially loving towards babies, small children, and people with disabilities.  \n\n\n== See also ==\nTerrier\nAustralian Silky Terrier\nTerrier Group\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAustralian Terrier at Curlie"}, {"id": 41, "name": "Austrian Black and Tan Hound", "country": "Austria", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog41", "description": "The Austrian Black and Tan Hound is a breed of dog originating in Austria.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt is thought to be the true descendant of the original Celtic Hounds, although there is no known history of the Austrian Black and Tan Hound until after the middle of the 19th century. This large sized hound was used for tracking wounded game, most commonly hare, in high altitudes.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nColouring in this breed is highly important; it must be black with small, clearly defined, light to dark fawn markings. Two fawn marks above the eyes must be present. The coat is smooth, dense and short (about 2 cm in length). The long tail is slightly bent and the ears are medium in length and lie flat with rounded tips. Males are 50\u201356 centimetres (20\u201322 inches), while females are 48\u201354 centimetres (19\u201321 inches). They weigh 15 to 22 kg (33-49 pounds).\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nIt has a keen sense of smell. It is an elegant runner, used in all sorts of game. It has a lovely voice, and makes a great pet due to its good-natured personality. It is not a dog wanting to be in a city. A suitable home will be in a rural area where the dog will have lots of space to run unrestricted by a leash. It loves to work.\n\n\n== Care ==\nIt needs daily exercise. The breed will only require a once-a-week brushing and bathing only when necessary. Nails need to be trimmed regularly and ears need to be cleaned every day to avoid ear infections. There are no genetic diseases known to affect this breed, which is fairly healthy, and lives up to 12 to 14 years of age.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nBrandlbracke is a compound word, stemming from \"Brand\" (harmful fire, fire that went out of control) which refers to the fawn markings and \"Bracke\", a type of hunting dog.\nVier\u00e4ugl is the Austro-Bavarian diminutive of \"Vierauge\", meaning: somebody our something having four eyes. It refers to the distinctive fawn markings above the eyes.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 42, "name": "Austrian Pinscher", "country": "Austria", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog42", "description": "The Austrian Pinscher (\u00d6sterreichischer Pinscher, FCI No. 64) is a medium-sized breed of pinscher-type dog from Austria, where dogs of the type were originally farm dogs, keeping barns free of rats and acting as home guards, livestock guardians, and drovers. The name originally given to the breed in 1928 was the \u00d6sterreichischer Kurzhaarpinscher (Austrian Shorthaired Pinscher) to differentiate it from similarly named breeds, but today in its country of origin the breed is officially called the \u00d6sterreichischer Pinscher, or Austrian Pinscher in English.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nLike other farm dogs raised for work rather than for pets or show, the appearance can vary a great deal, although there is a definite breed standard. In general, the Austrian Pinscher is a normally proportioned strong and sturdy dog, 33 \u2013 48 cm (13 - 19 inches) at the withers. The breed has button ears and a head described as being shaped like a pear. The double coat is short to medium long, in a variety of yellow, red or black and tan colours, usually with white markings on the face, chest, feet and tip of the tail. The long tail is held high, and dogs of this breed should look lively and alert. They are heavier, more rugged and rectangular in appearance than the German Pinscher.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Austrian Shorthaired Pinscher was recognised as a breed for the first time in 1928, but the breed was developed from an old type of pinscher found on farms in the  Austrian countryside, a mixture of German Pinschers and the local dogs. Claims of great antiquity have been made for the old pinscher type. Since there are no records, it is not possible to tell how the old type is related to the modern-day breed, although they do look somewhat similar.\nAt the end of the 19th century, the farm dogs began to die out when the work they did was no longer needed. In the early 20th century Emil Hauck, looking for an aboriginal dog type identified in 1843 by H. von Meyer as Canis palustris or dog of the marshes (a type of dog, not an actual species), found what he believed were some examples of similar dogs in the Austrian countryside. In 1921 he began serious breeding to revive and define the type of the breed, to separate them from other landrace pinschers of the area. The Austrian Kennel Club (\u00d6sterreicher Kynologenverband) first recognised the breed as the \u00d6sterreichischer Kurzhaarpinscher (translates in English as Austrian Shorthaired Pinscher) in 1928. The name was given to the breed to identify its place of origin as Austria (\u00d6sterreich), and to differentiate it from the Schnauzer which at that time was called the Rough-haired Pinscher (rauhaariger Pinscher). After World War II, though, the breed almost vanished. In the 1970s only one registered dog of the breed remained, named Diokles of Angern. Breeding this dog with other dogs identified as of the old pinscher type in the area (\"Landpinschern\") has brought the breed back, although there are still only a small number of them.Ark Austria (Arche Austria), an association for the preservation of endangered indigenous breeds, lists the Austrian Pinscher and states that it is highly vulnerable, with only 6 to 12 breeding animals, who are being carefully bred to preserve health and breed type.The breed is recognised in its country of origin by the \u00d6sterreischer Kynologenverband (\u00d6KV, Austrian Kennel Club) and internationally by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in the Pinscher section of Group 2. It is also recognised by the United Kennel Club in the United States as the Austrian Pinscher as of 2006, in the Terrier Group, for its background as a rat hunter. In addition it is recognised by a number of minor kennel clubs and internet based dog registry businesses under a variety of translations of the name, who may rewrite the standard to suit producers of dogs for the rare breed pet market. Purchasers of puppies and dogs from groups outside the Austrian breed restoration program should read the original standard (obtainable in translation from the FCI) and their dog's pedigree to make sure they are buying an Austrian Pinscher and not an excessively inbred or a random-bred dog.\n\n\n== Health ==\nNo data have been collected on the breed's health, but good health is a stated objective of the breed restoration breeding in Austria.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe breed is described as \"a pleasant companion\" for rural and suburban areas. The breed standard describes the ideal Austrian Pinscher's temperament and character as playful, not inclined to be a hunter, and being an \"incorruptible guard\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nPreservation breeding\nLandrace\nGerman Pinscher\nMixed breed dog\nPinscher\nBreed Groups\nTerrier Group\nStandard Schnauzer\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArk Austria (Arche Austria), an association for the preservation of endangered indigenous Austrian breeds\nAustrian Pinscher at Curlie"}, {"id": 43, "name": "Azawakh", "country": "Mali", "type": "Sighthound and Pariah", "picture": "dog43", "description": "The Azawakh is a sighthound livestock guardian breed of dog from West Africa. It is also used as a hunting dog, though relegated to a secondary function due to the lack of game in the region. With ancient origins, it is raised throughout the Sahelian zone of Mali, Niger,  and Burkina Faso.  This region  includes the Azawagh Valley for which the breed is named.  While commonly associated with the nomadic Tuareg people, they are also bred and owned by other ethnic groups such as the Peulh, Bella, and Hausa. The Azawakah is more related to the Sloughi than it is to the Saluki.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nMorphology is very similar to that of the Middle Eastern and South Indian sight hounds, all swift, high-bred coursing hounds, although there are several obvious differences. For example, a short, flat back combined with long legs place the hips higher than the withers. The Azawakh is almond eyed and thin. It moves with a distinctly feline gait and can be found in a variety of colors as well as varying degrees of refinement, though format is basically constant.\n\n\n=== Height and weight ===\nThe standards call for a hound from 33 to 55 pounds (15 to 25 kg); its height is 24 to 29 inches (61 to 74 cm). The coat is very short and almost absent on the belly. Its bone structure shows clearly through the skin and musculature. Its muscles are \"dry\", meaning that they  are quite flat, unlike the Greyhound and Whippet. In this respect it is similar in type to the Saluki.\n\n\n=== Colours ===\n \nColours permitted by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) breed standard are clear sand to dark fawn/brown, red and brindle (with or without a dark mask), with white bib, tail tip, and white on all feet (which can be tips of toes to high stockings). Since 2015 white stockings that go above the elbow joint are considered disqualifying features in the FCI member countries, as is a white collar or half collar (Irish marked).\nSome conservationists support the idea that in Africa, Azawakhs are still found in a variety of colours such as red, blue fawn (that is, with a lilac cast), grizzle, and, rarely, blue and black with various white markings including Irish marked (white collar) and particolour (mostly white). Because of this wide color variation in the native population, the American standard used by the AKC and UKC allows any color combination found in Africa. (AKC and UKC are not a member of the FCI)\n\n\n=== Movement ===\nThe Azawakh's light, supple, lissome gait is a notable breed characteristic, as is an upright double suspension gallop.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nAzawakhs are an incredibly sound coursing hound. Serious  injuries are rare. The dogs heal very quickly from injury.\nAzawakh have no known incidence of hip dysplasia. There is a small occurrence of adult-onset idiopathic epilepsy in the breed. Wobbler disease, or cervical vertebral instability, does rarely occur. Some breeders believe this is largely a developmental problem where puppies grow too quickly due to a high-protein Western diet.\n\n\n== Reproduction ==\nLike the Basenji and Tibetan Mastiff, the Azawakh often has a single annual estrus. Unassisted birth of healthy puppies is normal. Litter sizes are usually from four to six puppies, but litters as small as one and as large as ten occur.\n\n\n== Care ==\nAzawakh need a fairly high level of exercise and should have regular runs off lead in large enclosed areas to run off steam. The dogs are very social and emotional. They need a master that provides firm but fair leadership. Azawakh thrive on companionship of other Azawakh.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nUnlike other sighthounds, the primary function of the Azawakh in its native land is that of protector. It develops an intense bond with its owner, yet can perform independently from its master. With those they accept, Azawakh are gentle and extremely affectionate. With strangers many are reserved and prefer not to be touched, but are not inherently aggressive. Although raised to protect livestock, they do not have innate aggression toward canines or humans unless they are threatened.\nAzawakh have high energy and tremendous endurance. They are excellent training companions for runners and are nearly impervious to heat. They will happily run in weather over 100 degrees Fahrenheit that would kill a Greyhound.\nMany Azawakh dislike rain and cold weather.\nAzawakh are pack oriented and form complex social hierarchies. They have tremendous memories and are able to recognize each other after long periods of separation. They can often be found sleeping on top of each other for warmth and companionship.Alberto Rossi: \"To raise an Azawakh is like building a very fragile construction, which takes a lot of sensibility and can be destroyed from one minute to the next. But every minute it lasts, it fills you with great happiness.\" Every time I\u00b4m sitting in a chair or sofa at least one of my dogs tries to take a seat on my lap. The same happens to those of my guests which they love. In these moments they seem to be the image of calmness, gentleness, and trust. But one should not be deceived about this. In the deepest place of their soul resides something wild and native, and they will remind us about it with the first occasion and we should not forget, even for a moment, not to treat them like a normal dog.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nBred by the Tuareg, Fula and various other nomads of the Sahara and sub-Saharan Sahel in the countries of Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, and southern Algeria, the breed known by the tuaregs as \u201dOska\u201d was used there as a guard dog and to hunt gazelle and hare at speeds up to 40 miles per hour. The austerity of the Sahel environment has ensured that only the most fit dogs survive and has accentuated the breed's ruggedness and independence. Unlike some other sighthounds, the Azawakh is more of a pack hunter and they bump down the quarry with hindquarters when it has been tired out. In role of a guard dog, if an Azawakh senses danger it will bark to alert the other members of the pack, and they will gather together as a pack under the lead of the alpha dog, then chase off or attack the predator. The Sloughi, by comparison, is more of an independent lone hunter and has a high hunting instinct.\nThey are relatively uncommon in Europe and North America but there is a growing band of devotees. Azawakhs have a range of temperaments from lap dog to quite fierce. Lifelong socialization and firm but gentle handling are critical. Well socialised and trained, they can be good with other dogs, cats, children, and strangers. Azawakh may be registered with the FCI in the USA via the Federaci\u00f3n Can\u00f3fila de Puerto Rico (FCPR). European FCI clubs and the AKC recognize the FCPR as an acceptable registry. The AKC (not a member of the FCI) currently recognizes Azawakh as a Foundation Stock Service breed and they are eligible to participate in AKC-sanctioned Companion & Performance events. The breed will enter the AKC Miscellaneous Class on June 30, 2011. The American Azawakh Association (AAA). is the AKC Parent Club for the Azawakh. Azawakh may be registered with the UKC and ARBA. The breed is not yet registered by CKC. Azawakh are eligible for ASFA and AKC lure coursing and NOFCA open field coursing events.\n\n\n=== Origin ===\n\nGenetic, blood protein and archaeological studies, as well as direct observation in the field, offer a glimpse into the origin of the contemporary Azawakh breed. It originated from the pariah dogs of sub-Saharan Africa\u2014also called bush dogs or basenji\u2014and is also closely related to the Sloughi of the Maghreb. Despite morphological similarities, mitochondrial DNA evidence shows that it is only very distantly related to other sight hounds. Azawakh have a rare glucose isomerase allele (GPIB) that occurs only in foxes, jackals, Italian wolves, Sloughi dogs and a handful of other quite unrelated rare dogs found mostly in Japan. The presence of the GPIB suggests an ancient differentiation of the Azawakh from other dog populations near the base of the dog family tree divergence from wolves or perhaps a uniquely African cross-breeding with local African canids such as jackals. Petroglyph rock art dating from 8,000 to 10,000 years ago during the Green Sahara (also known as the Holocene and Neolithic Subpluvial) shows cursorial dogs in conjunction with hunters. Archaeologists have found dog bones buried in Holocene settlements in the Sahara. At the close of the Holocene Wet Phase in the 4th millennium BCE, the Sahara returned to desert and created a formidable physical barrier to travel. Together, this evidence suggests that the Azawakh population has a unique genetic heritage that has been largely isolated from other dog populations for millennia.\nIn the common era the Sahel dogs are almost totally isolated from northern dogs by the Sahara, but the ties to the pariah dogs to the south are extremely close. Azawakh are virtually indistinguishable from the Sahel pariah dog population from which they are drawn. In addition to a basic physical structure, the Azawakh share a number of unique traits with the pariah dogs:\n\nintense suspicion of the unknown\nstrong guarding instinct\npack hunting behavior\ncomplex social hierarchies\nunique vocalizations\nextra pre-molar teeth\nstrong instinct to dig up big dens\nThroughout the Sahel, very elegant puppies can be found among rustic siblings. The Sahel nomads do not have the same breed concepts as in the West and, unlike the Bedouin of the North, do not recognize a strict separation of al hor (noble) from kelb (mongrel) dogs. The nomads act as an extra level of selection on top of the intense natural selection pressure of the Sahel environment. The approach to selection is diametrically opposed to Western breeding, and presents the advantage of maintaining a large reservoir of genetic variability and resilience.\nThe peoples of the Sahel control dam lines and cull puppies heavily at birth according to locally held aesthetic criteria that are not yet fully understood. In the Sahel, color is not a selection criterion. The alpha male dog from the local population is usually the sire. Females are usually culled unless the family projects a need for more dogs in the future.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nColour, Pattern and Marking Varieties of the Azawakh in the Regions of Origin, 2005, Dr. Gabriel Meissen.\nDogs of Africa, 2003, by Sian Hall, Alpine Blue Ribbon Books.\nDog's Best Friend, 1999, by Ursula Birr, Gerald Krakauer and Daniela Osiander, Park Street Press.\nThe Functional Saluki, 1993, Dan Belkin, Ph.D., Transcribed from a seminar given at the Saluki Club of America National Specialty.\nThe Genetics of the Dog, 2001, Anatoly Ruvinsky and J.

They are recognised as one of the most dangerous dog breeds in the world.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nJammu & Kashmir region, especially Pir Panjal Mountains of Himalayas and Hindukush ranges.\n\n\n== Utilisation ==\nIt is particularly used for guarding sheep, protecting farms and homes.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nIt is not recognised by any major kennel clubs.\n\n\n== History ==\nThis is an ancient breed of Kashmir that was bred by local nomads called as  bakarwals  and local people of Jammu and Kashmir for guarding their flocks of goats, sheep and cattle, along with their houses from centuries. \nThere are two strains of this breed,  Simple Bakarwal  and  Ladakhi Bakarwal . Ladakhi Bakarwal strain has a specific unique ability of open mouth barking, for an extensive period of time, also called as  \u2018hk-saya\u2019 or \u2018yak-saya\u2019  in the native language. It means nonstop barking without taking a breath or continuous bark in one breath.\n\n\n== General appearance ==\nBakarwal is a powerful, heavy bone, medium to large size dog. It is an agile and a sturdy breed, a typical mountain dog with a furry coat and plumy tail that gives it\u2019s a majestic look. It looks like a medium version of Tibetan Mastiff. Some believe that the dog has descended from Tibetan Mastiff, prehistoric molosser and wild wolves. It is mostly in black colour with white at toes and chest. The dog has a vegetarian appetite that mainly includes bread and milk. \nCommon colours are black and tan, red, fawn, pied, sable, white and brindle. It is a slow maturing breed. \nBakarwal bitch is a slow breeder and only litters once in a year, with 3-4 pups only. In the ladakhi strain of bakarwal breed, less furry coat and less plumy tail are observed.\n\n\n== Health concerns ==\nMajor health concerns noted are canine hip dysplasia, bloating, while minor concerns are patellar luxation, obesity and cryptorchidism.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 45, "name": "Barbet (dog)", "country": "France", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog45", "description": "The Barbet is a breed of dog; it is a medium-sized French water dog. It is listed in Group 8 (retrievers, flushing dogs, water dogs) by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine, the French Kennel Club.\nThe breed name comes from the French word barbe, which means 'beard'.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Barbet is a rare breed. Most Barbets, especially those shown in conformation shows, are entirely black, black and white, or brown. It is common to see white chest spots and white paws or legs on black or brown coated dogs. Particoloured, cream (or creme), and pied variations are being bred but in limited numbers.\nMale Barbets usually grow to be about 21 to 25 in (53 to 64 cm) tall and between 40 and 60 lb (18 and 27 kg), while females usually reach about 20 to 23 in (51 to 58 cm) and 30 to 50 lb (14 to 23 kg).\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe breed stands 58\u201365 cm (23\u201326 in) for the males,  53\u201361 cm (21\u201324 in) for females with a tolerance of 1 cm +/-  1 cm (0.39 in), and weighs 17\u201328 kg (37\u201362 lb). The Barbet is a prototypic water dog, with a long, woolly, and curly coat.\nTheir coats grow long and must be groomed regularly, otherwise the coat can become matted and the barbet may lose small tufts of hair like tumbleweeds.\nThe accepted colours of the breed are solid black, brown, fawn, grey, pale fawn, white, or more or less pied. All shades of red-fawn and pale fawn are permitted. The shade should, preferably, be the same as the colour of the body. Grey and white are extremely rare; mixed colours (except with white) are considered a fault. The most common colors are black or brown with white markings. The birth figures worldwide for 2007 are 176. All born were black or brown some with white markings on the chest, chin, and legs.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe Barbet's personality is described as friendly, joyful, obedient, and intelligent. They are quick to learn and need lifelong obedience training. They are great with children, families, and the elderly. Barbets will bond with their family and prefer to be in the same room with the family at all times. They need exercise daily to keep the dog in a healthy state of mind and body.\nThey are capable retrievers for waterfowl hunting. In France, the Barbet can take the test d'aptitudes naturelles (TAN), a basic water-retrieving test, and has recently been permitted to participate in the brevet de chasse a l'eau (BCE), a general hunting-dog test involving field and water trials. In Germany, the Barbet takes part in field trials.\n\n\n=== Genetic diseases ===\nBarbets are vulnerable to certain genetic defects. Due to the limited gene pool for this breed, conscientious breeders carefully study pedigrees and select dogs to minimize the chance of genetic diseases. Unfortunately, like many breeds, a growing popularity has encouraged breeding by people who are not knowledgeable about the breed. Of the few health issues that have exhibited themselves; epilepsy, hernias, hip dysplasia and entropion, most problems can be traced back 4\u20136 generations. Often this was due to limited breeding stock as well as the fact that many matings were with dogs of unknown medical history.\n\n\n== Overall health ==\n \nDue to the extremely low number of barbets in the world, little is known about long term health issues. Some issues that have exhibited themselves are ear infections, hip dysplasia, hernias, undescended testicles, undershot/overshot bites, and epilepsy. However, a study has just begun in France about health issues in the barbet as several breeds have recently \"contributed\" to the Barbet. Most breeders today hipscore the parents before any matings and A, B, and C hipscores can be used.\nThe most common of these issues are ear infections, a problem in most water dog varieties. Ear problems can be minimized by proper ear care. A veterinarian should be consulted if the dog shows signs of an ear infection. The ear should always be clear of any hair, and inspected very regularly.\n\n\n=== Hip dysplasia ===\nLike the poodle group of breeds, the Barbet is vulnerable to hip dysplasia. The risk of a Barbet developing the condition can be greatly reduced by thoroughly checking the pedigrees and health clearances in both the sire and dam of the dog.\n\n\n=== Lifespan ===\nLifespan of the Barbet averages 13\u201315 years, with one recorded living until 19 years of age.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe breed is an integral part of dog history, and many familiar breeds have Barbet in their ancestry. Depending on geography and necessity, the barbet connected through the centuries in various capacities, and as a companion dog, but more as an all-around working dog. The term barbet became throughout centuries a \"generic\" name for a dog with a long, curly, woolly coat.The Grand Barbet depicted in Count George Louis Buffon's book Histoire Naturelle (1750) is thought to be the original source of the various water dog breeds (poodles, Portuguese Water Dog, American Water Spaniel, and so on).  Its actual origin is lost in antiquity but may stem from corded-coat herding dog stock, also ancestral to breeds like the Komondor.Barbets have also worked as sailor's companions, much like the Portuguese Water Dog. It was best known for being a waterfowl retriever in the marshes, wetlands, and estuaries of France. This is where the expression \"muddy as a barbet\" came from in the 19th century. Between the late 18th to early 19th centuries, the same dog was known as the barbet in France, the barbone in Italy, and the Pudel in Germany; for almost a hundred years the barbets and poodles were considered the same breed.With the advent of dog shows and selective breeding based purely on aesthetics, the poodles were developed to be more elegant and of a solid colour, to distinguish them from their more common progenitors. The versatile nature of the Barbet has meant its survival, and many of today's Barbets still have traits of their ancestral stock lost in the poodle group. The Barbet's origins and bloodlines can be traced back to the writing of the first standard in 1891.The breed is gaining popularity in Scandinavian countries and North America as more and more people are becoming interested in this all-around working dog, often simply as a pet.\n\n\n== Status in the United States ==\n\nThere are very few Barbets in the United States. Estimated Barbet numbers living in America as of 2013 were between 150 and 200. Steps are being taken to slowly and responsibly increase the Barbet population in the States, through careful breeding and imports from Canada and Europe.\nCurrently, Barbets may be fully registered in the United States with American Rare Breed Association (ARBA) or the United Kennel Club (UKC), and there has been a recent acceptance in the American Kennel Club (AKC) Foundation Stock Service Program. For a breed to receive full AKC recognition, there must be at least 150 breeding specimens registered with the AKC's Foundation Stock Service, and there must be an active breed-specific AKC-affiliated club promoting the breed (e.g., through competitions, training programs, and conformance shows.  US breeding has been slow: in 2009, there was only one new litter of six purebred Barbets born in the United States; in 2011, two additional litters totalling sixteen puppies; two litters in 2010; and three in 2013.\n\n\n== Status in Great Britain (UK) ==\n\nIn modern times, the first Barbet, a male, was brought into the UK in 2001, although he did not reproduce. In 2007, two unrelated females were brought in from France, having completed their period of quarantine; the majority of Barbets currently in the UK are descendants of these. Since then, further examples of the breed have been imported from France, Netherlands, Canada, Poland, and Sweden. Several UK-born barbets have been used in the breeding programmes of other countries; their offspring can be found in Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Sweden, Finland, and Canada.\nFrom April 2018, the Barbet will be the 220th breed recognized by The Kennel Club of the UK. Barbets born in the UK prior to this date have been registered in France by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine (SCC), a national affiliate of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI). There are on average only one or two British-born litters born per year. As of 2018, there are approximately 140 barbets living in the UK.\nThe majority of Barbets in the UK are kept as pets, although a small number are used regularly as gun dogs, agility dogs, and for search-and-rescue work; they can also take part in conformation shows in FCI-member countries, with two British Barbets achieving French Champion status in 2014.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBarbet dog at Curlie"}, {"id": 46, "name": "Basenji", "country": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "type": "Sighthound and Pariah", "picture": "dog46", "description": "The Basenji is a breed of hunting dog. It was bred from stock that originated in central Africa. Most of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world place the breed in the hound group\u2014more specifically, in the sighthound type. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale places the breed in its group five (spitz and primitive types), and the United Kennel Club (US) places the breed in its Sighthound and pariah group.\nThe Basenji produces an unusual yodel-like sound (commonly called a \"baroo\"), due to its unusually shaped larynx. This trait also gives the Basenji the nickname \"barkless dog\".Basenjis share many unique traits with pariah dog types. Basenjis, like dingoes, New Guinea singing dogs and some other breeds of dog, come into estrus only once annually\u2014as compared to other dog breeds, which may have two or more breeding seasons every year. Both dingoes and Basenji lack a distinctive odor, and are prone to howls, yodels, and other vocalizations over the characteristic bark of modern dog breeds. One theory holds that the latter trait is the result of selecting against dogs that frequently bark\u2014in the traditional Central African context\u2014because barking could lead enemies to humans' forest encampments. While dogs that resemble the Basenji in some respects are commonplace over much of Africa, the breed's original foundation stock came from the old growth forest regions of the Congo Basin, where its structure and type were fixed by adaptation to its habitat, as well as use (primarily net hunting in extremely dense old-growth forest vegetation).\nThe name comes from the Lingala language of the Congo, mbw\u00e1 na bas\u025b\u0301nzi which means 'villager dogs'.\n\n\n== Lineage ==\nThe Basenji has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century. Recent DNA studies based on whole-genome sequences indicate that the domestic dog is a genetically divergent subspecies of the gray wolf and was derived from a now-extinct ghost population of Late Pleistocene wolves, and the basenji and the dingo are both considered to be basal members of the domestic dog clade. \"The term basal refers to a lineage that diverges early in the history of the group...and lies on a branch that originates near the common ancestor of the group.\"\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe Azande and Mangbetu people from the northeastern Congo region describe Basenjis, in the local Lingala language, as mbw\u00e1 na bas\u025b\u0301nzi. Translated, this means 'dogs of the savages', or 'dogs of the villagers'. In the Congo, the Basenji is also known as \"dog of the bush\". The dogs are also known to the Azande of southern Sudan as ango angari. The word bas\u025b\u0301nzi itself is the plural form of mos\u025b\u0301nzi. In Swahili, another Bantu language, from East Africa, mbwa shenzi translates to 'wild dog'. Another local name is m\u2019bwa m\u2019kube m\u2019bwa wamwitu, or 'dog that jumps up and down',  a reference to their tendency to jump straight up to spot their quarry.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOriginating on the continent of Africa, basenji-like dogs (Tesem) are depicted in drawings and models dating back to the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt. Dogs of this type were originally kept for hunting small game by tracking and driving the game into nets.Europeans first described the type of dog the Basenji breed derives from in 1895\u2014in the Congo. These local dogs, which Europeans identified as a unique breed and called basenji, were prized by locals for their intelligence, courage, speed, and silence. An article published called The Intelligence of Dogs by Stanley Coren, Ph.D. questions this. It ranks the breed at #78 out of 79, which is the second to lowest rank in intelligence. Some consider this an unreliable list, as it focuses on only the ability to listen to a first command. Some consider independent dogs such as Basenjis and Afghan Hounds more intelligent than obedient breeds because of their ability to recognize which actions benefit them, and which simply please another.Several attempts were made to bring the breed to England, but the earliest imports succumbed to disease. In 1923, for example, Lady Helen Nutting brought six Basenjis with her from Sudan, but all six died from distemper shots they received in quarantine. It was not until the 1930s that foundation stock was successfully established in England, and then to the United States by animal importer Henry Trefflich. It is likely that nearly all the Basenjis in the Western world are descended from these few original imports. The breed was officially accepted into the AKC in 1943. In 1990, the AKC stud book was reopened to 14 new imports at the request of the Basenji Club of America. The stud book was reopened again to selected imported dogs from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013. An American-led expedition collected breeding stock in villages in the Basankusu area of the Democratic Republic of Congo, in 2010. Basenjis are also registered with the UKC.\nThe popularity of the Basenji in the United States, according to the American Kennel Club, has declined over the past decade, with the breed ranked 71st in 1999, decreasing to 84th in 2006, and to 93rd in 2011.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nBasenjis are small, short-haired dogs with erect ears, tightly curled tails and graceful necks. A Basenji's forehead is wrinkled, even more so when they are young or extremely excited. A Basenji's eyes are typically almond-shaped. Basenjis typically weigh about 9.1\u201310.9 kg (20\u201324 lb) and stand 41\u201346 cm (16\u201318 in) at the shoulder. They are a square breed, which means they are as long as they are tall with males usually larger than females. Basenjis are athletic dogs, and deceptively powerful for their size. They have a graceful, confident gait like a trotting horse, and skim the ground in a double suspension gallop, with their characteristic curled tail straightened out for greater balance when running at their top speed. Basenjis come in a few different colorations: red, black, tricolor, and brindle, and they all have white feet, chests and tail tips. They can also come in trindle, which is a tricolor with brindle points, a rare combination.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Basenji is alert, energetic, curious and reserved with strangers. The Basenji tends to become emotionally attached to a single human. Basenjis may not get along with non-canine pets. Basenjis dislike wet weather, like to climb, and can easily get over chain wire fences.\nBasenjis often stand on their hind legs, somewhat like a meerkat, by themselves or leaning on something; this behavior is often observed when the dog is curious about something. Basenjis have a strong prey drive. According to the book The Intelligence of Dogs, they are the second least trainable dog.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThere is only one completed health survey of dog breeds, including the Basenji, that was conducted by the UK Kennel Club in 2004. The survey indicated the prevalence of diseases in Basenjis with dermatitis (9% of responses), incontinence and bladder infection (5%), hypothyroidism (4%), Pyometra and infertility (4%).\n\n\n=== Longevity ===\nBasenjis in the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey had a median lifespan of 13.6 years (sample size of 46 deceased dogs), which is 1\u20132 years longer than the median lifespan of other breeds of similar size. The oldest dog in the survey was 17.5 years. Most common causes of death were old age (30%), urologic (incontinence, Fanconi syndrome, chronic kidney failure 13%), behavior (\"unspecified\" and aggression 9%), and cancer (9%).\n\n\n=== Fanconi syndrome ===\nFanconi syndrome, an inheritable disorder in which the renal (kidney) tubes fail to reabsorb electrolytes and nutrients, is unusually common in Basenjis. Symptoms include excessive drinking, excessive urination, and glucose in the urine, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of diabetes. Fanconi syndrome usually presents between 4 and 8 years of age, but sometimes as early as 3 years or as late as 10 years. Fanconi syndrome is treatable and organ damage is reduced if treatment begins early. Basenji owners are advised to test their dog's urine for glucose once a month beginning at the age of 3 years. Glucose testing strips designed for human diabetics are inexpensive and available at most pharmacies. A Fanconi disease management protocol has been developed that can be used by veterinarians to treat Fanconi-afflicted dogs.\n\n\n==== Fanconi DNA linkage test ====\nIn 2007, the first linked marker DNA test was released for predicting Fanconi syndrome in Basenjis. With this test, it is possible to more accurately determine the probability of a dog's carrying the gene for Fanconi syndrome.\nDogs tested using this \"linkage test\" return one of the following statuses:\n\nProbably clear/normalIndicates the individual has most likely inherited normal DNA from both parents. It is unlikely that Basenjis that test this way will produce affected puppies, no matter which dog they breed with.Probably carrierIndicates the individual has most likely inherited normal DNA from one parent and DNA with the Fanconi syndrome mutation from the other parent.This basenji is unlikely to develop Fanconi syndrome, but could produce puppies that do. To minimize the chances of this happening, it is recommended carriers be bred only to those that test as Probably clear/Normal for Fanconi syndrome.Probably equivocal/indeterminateIndicates the individual's DNA contained features found in both \"normal\" and \"carrier\" Basenjis. At present it cannot be predicted whether these Basenjis are carriers or normal; however, it is unlikely that they will develop Fanconi syndrome. The safest strategy would be to treat them as \u201ccarriers\u201d and bred to  only those Basenjis that test as Probably Clear/Normal for Fanconi syndrome.Probably affectedIndicates the individual is likely to develop clinical Fanconi syndrome and is likely to produce puppies with Fanconi syndrome if bred to Basenjis other than those that test as Probably Clear/Normal for Fanconi syndrome.This linkage test is being provided as a tool to assist breeders whilst research continues towards the development of the direct Fanconi test.\n\n\n=== Other Basenji health issues ===\nBasenjis sometimes carry a simple recessive gene that, when homozygous for the defect, causes genetic hemolytic anemia. Most 21st-century Basenjis are descended from ancestors that have tested clean. When lineage from a fully tested line (set of ancestors) cannot be completely verified, the dog should be tested before breeding. As this is a non-invasive DNA test, a Basenji can be tested for HA at any time.\nBasenjis sometimes suffer from hip dysplasia, resulting in loss of mobility and arthritis-like symptoms. All dogs should be tested by either OFA or PennHIP prior to breeding.\nMalabsorption, or immunoproliferative enteropathy, is an autoimmune intestinal disease that leads to anorexia, chronic diarrhea, and even death. A special diet can improve the quality of life for afflicted dogs.\nThe breed can also fall victim to progressive retinal atrophy (a degeneration of the retina causing blindness) and several less serious hereditary eye problems such as coloboma (a hole in the eye structure), and persistent pupillary membrane (tiny threads across the pupil).\n\nBasenji\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe title character of the 1954 novel Good-bye, My Lady, by James H. Street, is a Basenji. The book was made into a film of the same name in 1956, with a cast that included Brandon deWilde, Walter Brennan, and Sidney Poitier.\nThe true story of a Basenji was featured in the episode \"The Cat Came Back\" on the radio program This American Life.\nAccording to the webcomic Achewood, if Jesus Christ were a dog, he'd be a Basenji.\nBasenjis are featured in the fourth episode, \"Tyler Tucker, I Presume?\", of the third season of the animated television series The Wild Thornberrys. Nigel Thornberry encounters a group of tribesmen along with their Congolese hunting dogs. The series's director, Mark Risley, owns several Basenjis, and his dogs provided the recorded voices for their animated counterparts.\nAn episode of Pound Puppies, \"The Pups Who Loved Me\", revolves around a Basenji secret agent character by the name of Bondo. The dog is drawn with an appropriate likeness, but appears to bark, which is uncharacteristic of the breed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAfrican village dog\nIndian pariah dog\nPariah dog\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBasenji at Curlie"}, {"id": 47, "name": "Basque Shepherd Dog", "country": "Spain", "type": "", "picture": "dog47", "description": "The Basque Shepherd Dog is a landrace breed of dog originating in the Basque Country and traditionally used by the local shepherds to help them take care of their cattle and sheep. Perro de pastor vasco (pastor vasco for short) is the Spanish name, and euskal artzain txakurra is the Basque, by which they are known in their homeland. It is believed that they originated from Central European herding dogs.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThese dogs are well proportioned, with strong, rectangular bodies and trotter features. Their eyes are oval and are brown or amber. Their ears are medium-sized, triangular and sometimes show folds. The vivid yellow medium length rough coat is longer over the trunk than over the head and is shorter on the face, but does not hide the eyes. The relation between height and length is about 1/1.2. The head is rather light relative to the trunk, which is attached by a short neck and muscular.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Smooth-haired Gorbeiakoa ===\nOf the two distinct types of Basque Shepherd Dog, the more outgoing Gorbeiakoa is the more pure and ancient of the two. It is recognized by the moderate length hair coat, which texture is smooth and soft. It is very short and smooth on the face and on the front of the legs. There is a plume on the back of the legs. The coat color can be either fire-red or fawn, and it has a dark mask on the muzzle. The height of males is 47 to 61 cm and of females 46 to 59 cm. Males weight 18 to 36 kg and females 17 to 29 kg.\n\n\n=== Rough-haired Iletsua ===\nThe Iletsua variety has a rough, coarse and bristle, moderate length hair. It is shorter on the front of the legs. The coat color is either cinnamon or fawn. The height of males is 47 to 63 cm and of females 46 to 58 cm. Males weight 18 to 33 kg and females 17 to 30 kg.\n\n\n== History ==\nThis sheepdog is one of the oldest dog breeds. Skeletal remains were found in Neolithic caves dated to 12,000 years ago. They are interpreted as demonstrating that the people living in the area of what is now Basque Country were shepherds. In frescoes and paintings of the sixteenth century there are representations of the Basque Shepherd Dog. Nevertheless, their recognition has required extensive research on records from throughout the Basque Country. Only after demonstrating their differences from other breeds such as the Pyrenean Shepherd and the Catalan sheepdog, did the Royal Canine Society of Spain recognize the Basque Shepherd Dog as a breed with two varieties: Iletsua and Gorbeiakoa, in January 1996.\nGorbeiakoa originates from the region of Gorbea and Iletsua means \"hairy\" or \"shaggy\" in Basque.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe Basque Shepherd Dog can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, Rally obedience, Schutzhund, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Basque Shepherd Dogs that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== Basque Sheepdogs in America ==\nSome Basque herders brought their sheepdogs to the Western United States when they journeyed to the United States in the 1950s under sheep herding contracts with the Western Range Association in an agreement with the Spanish government.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBasque sheepdog trials\nBasque breeds and cultivars\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in English) bad link: Euskal Artzain txakurra\n(in Spanish) Portal: Euskal Artzain Txakurra\n(in Spanish) Portal: Euskal Artzain Txakurra, Euskera\n(in English) Basque Sheepdogs in America"}, {"id": 48, "name": "Basset Art\u00e9sien Normand", "country": "France", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog48", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 49, "name": "Basset Bleu de Gascogne", "country": "France", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog49", "description": "The Basset Bleu de Gascogne (French pronunciation: \u200b[b\u0251s\u025b bl\u00f8 d\u0259 \u0261as\u02c8k\u0254\u0272]), also known as the Blue Gascony Basset, is a long-backed, short legged breed of dog of the hound type. The breed originated in the Middle Ages, descended from the Grand Bleu de Gascogne.  It nearly became extinct around the early 19th century; its salvation was attributed to one Alain Bourbon. A French native breed, it is rare outside its homeland. It is recognized internationally by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, in the UK by The Kennel Club, and by the United Kennel Club in the United States. The \"bleu\" of its name is a reference to its coat which has a ticked appearance.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe color of their coat is predominantly white, ticked so as to give a bluish appearance, with brown spots and tan markings above the eyes and on the ears. They are a smooth-coated breed. Height at the withers is usually between 34 and 42 centimetres (13 and 17 in) although the Kennel Club standard specifies 30\u201338 centimetres (12\u201315 in). Their general appearance is usually not too heavy, and they weigh between 16 and 18 kilograms (35 and 40 lb). They have dark brown eyes and low-set ears that can reach at least the end of their muzzle. Because of their working nature as a hunting hound, effects of this work such as scars, nicks, notches on the ears and so on are not considered a fault in the show ring.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Basset Bleu de Gascogne descended directly from the old breed of Grand Bleu de Gascogne. They have been recorded in paintings from the 14th century in Gascony, southwest France. The exact origin of the breed is debated, one theory is that it is a cross of the Grand Bleu with the Saintongeois Basset, another theory is that the Basset Bleu is a natural mutation of the Grand combined with selective breeding for shorter legs in order to slow down the breed. It is thought that Gaston III of Foix-B\u00e9arn kept a pack of these dogs to hunt wild boar and wolves. He is known as the writer of the Livre de chasse, considered the classic treatise on medieval hunting.Prior to the French Revolution, hunting was reserved for the nobility who generally hunted on horseback. Following the French Revolution, hunting was opened up to the common people who would hunt on foot and found following a large hunting dog difficult. From this the slower, shorter legged Basset Bleu de Gascogne may have been created.During the early 19th century the breed nearly became extinct with a declining popularity in hunting. However, the breed was saved and revived by the work of Alain Bourbon.Today, the Basset Bleu is one of six types of Basset Hound recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale.\n\n\n== Recognition and categorisation ==\nThe Kennel Club of the UK recognizes the Basset Bleu De Gascogne in the imported breed register and in the Hound Group. The United Kennel Club recognised the breed in 1991, and both they and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) list the Basset Bleu De Gascogne in the Scenthound Group.  The breed is also known as the Blue Gascony Basset in the FCI. The Basset Bleu De Gascogne is not recognized by the American Kennel Club or the Canadian Kennel Club. In addition to the major registries, the Basset Bleu De Gascogne is also recognized by many minor registries and specialty registries, including as a rare breed under the American Rare Breed Association which uses the FCI standard.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBasset Hound\nBasset Fauve de Bretagne\nGrand Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9en\nPetit Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9en\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nExcellent video of a pack of Basset Bleu de Gascognes hunting YouTube\nBasset Bleu de Gascogne at Curlie"}, {"id": 50, "name": "Basset Fauve de Bretagne", "country": "France", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog50", "description": "The Basset Fauve de Bretagne is a short-legged hunting breed of dog of the scent hound type, originally from Brittany, a historical kingdom of France.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Basset Fauve de Bretagne is a smallish hound, built along the same lines as the Basset Hound, but lighter all through and longer in the leg.  Wire-coated, the coat is very harsh to the touch, dense, red-wheaten or fawn.  He measures 32 \u2013 38 cm in height and weighs between 36 - 40 lbs but due to the old, and no longer permitted, practice of registering mixed litters of Griffon and Basset Fauves sometimes a litter of bassets will produce a long legged dog more akin to the Griffon.  They have coarse, dense fur which may require stripping. The hair on the ears is shorter, finer and darker than that on the coat. The ears just reach the end of the nose rather than trailing on the ground and should be pleated. They should have dark eyes and nose and ideally no crook on the front legs. The French standard says these are the shortest backed of all the basset breeds so they generally do not appear as exaggerated as the British Basset.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThere is apparently only one completed health survey of Basset Fauve de Bretagnes, a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey with a small sample size.  The French Basset Fauve de Bretagne kennel club, Club du Fauve de Bretagne (http://fauvedebretagne.free.fr/ - in French), is currently (as of July 15, 2007) conducting a health survey, but the questionnaire asks owners about all of their dogs collectively (rather than each individual dog) and does not ask about longevity. The UK Club is planning a new, in depth health survey to be run late 2012 early 2013 in the hope that the longevity can be more accurately represented.\n\n\n=== Mortality ===\nBased on a small sample size of 15 deceased dogs, Basset Fauve de Bretagnes in the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey had a median longevity of 10.4 years (maximum 13.9 years), which is a typical median longevity for purebred dogs, but a little low compared to other breeds of similar size.  Most common causes of death were road traffic accidents, cancer, heart failure, and kidney failure. The high incidence of road traffic accidents may be perhaps blamed on this dog's love of the scent. Many pet Fauves go AWOL when they find a scent and this character trait is something an owner must never forget. Fauves can be trained very well in a controlled environment but training is rapidly forgotten once a fresh rabbit trail is found.\n\n\n=== Morbidity ===\nAmong 84 live dogs in the 2004 UKC survey, the most common health issues noted by owners were reproductive, aural (otitis media and otitis externa), and ocular (corneal ulcers and cataracts).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe breed was developed in France as a hunting dog from the larger Grand Fauve de Bretagne, a breed that is now extinct. There was a rumour that the  Basset Fauve de Bretagne was also close to extinction after the Second World War, and the breed was recreated using the remaining examples of the breed and crossing in Petit Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9en and standard wirehaired Dachshunds. However, the French club denies this, and says that Basset Fauve numbers were never so low. The middle breed, the Griffon Fauve de Bretagne, still exists but it is certainly rarer than the Basset. The breed in the UK is mainly seen as a show dog and family pet, finally coming off the Kennel Club's rare breed register in 2007. It can also be found in other parts of Europe where it is used to scent trail and also as a family pet. They are loving, happy, outgoing dogs and are good with children, but it must be remembered that  they are scent hounds and do retain their love of the hunt so may not suit every family. In the UK the breed has no hereditary faults; however, epilepsy has been identified in some breeding lines in France and other parts of Europe. Some Fauves are born with black in the coat; this may or may not go with maturity. It is less common to see them with white patches but when they do occur it is generally confined to the chest and top of the head. However, even though the black ticking and white patches are not accepted colours, of course it does not interfere with their hunting ability, which is their prime job, and so these colour Fauves are still seen and occur fairly often in litters. The correct colour for a Fauve is anything from fawn to red but it should be solid with darker shaded ears.\n\n\n== Breed description ==\nThe Basset Fauve de Bretagne is a neat looking hound, free from exaggeration and lively and friendly; as a scenthound, though, he has the usual failing of becoming absorbed with what he's scenting.  He is agile enough to trouble any rabbit he scents. Where the Basset Fauve de Bretagne is still used for hunting it is either singly or in pairs.\nThe Basset Fauve de Bretagne became established as a distinct breed early in the 19thC and were introduced to the UK in 1983, and their cheerful disposition has earned them a good many friends.\nOverall a very sound dog they do not appear to suffer from any particular hereditary defects.  However, like all hounds they are of an independent turn of mind, and early training in puppyhood will reap dividends later.   It is never realistic to expect a hound to be obedient, as they have their own agenda much of the time, but they should become fairly co-operative. The coat is easy to care for; a regular brush will keep it smart, but, like a terrier he will need stripping two or three times a year.  This is not a difficult task though you may prefer to leave it to a grooming parlour. A cheerful and equable breed, the Basset Fauve de Bretagne is of a size to make a handy housedog, though he has a great taste for exercise and thoroughly enjoys getting out into the fields. Most Basset Fauve de Bretagne's can be understood because their eyes are very clear and their ears turn out when they are nervous or unsure.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBasset Bleu de Gascogne\nGrand Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9en\nPetit Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9en\nBasset Hound\nCoat (dog)\nRare breed (dog)\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 51, "name": "Grand Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9en", "country": "France", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog51", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 52, "name": "Petit Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9en", "country": "France", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog52", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 53, "name": "Basset Hound", "country": "France", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog53", "description": "The Basset Hound is a short-legged breed of dog of the hound family. The Basset is a scent hound that was originally bred for the purpose of hunting hare. Their sense of smell and ability to ground-scent is second only to that of the Bloodhound. Basset Hounds are one of 6 recognised basset-type breeds in France.\nThe name Basset is derived from the French word bas, meaning \"low\", with the attenuating suffix -et, together meaning \"rather low\". Basset Hounds are usually bicolours or tricolours of standard hound colouration.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nBassets are large, short, solid and long, with curved sabre tails held high over their long backs. An adult dog weighs between 20 and 35 kilograms (44 and 77 lb). This breed, relative to its size, is heavier-boned than any other.This breed, like its ancestor the Bloodhound, has a hanging skin structure, which causes the face to occasionally look sad; this, for many people, adds to the breed's charm. The dewlap, seen as the loose, elastic skin around the neck, and the trailing ears which along with the Bloodhound are the longest of any breed, help trap the scent of what they are tracking. Its neck is wider than its head. This, combined with the loose skin around its face and neck means that flat collars can easily be pulled off. The previous FCI standard described the characteristic skin of the Basset, which resembles its ancestor the Bloodhound as \"loose\". This wording has since been updated to \"supple and elastic\". The looseness of the skin results in the Basset's characteristic facial wrinkles. They drool a lot due to their loose flews.\nThe Basset's skull is characterised by its large dolichocephalic nose, which is second only to the Bloodhound in scenting ability and number of olfactory receptor cells.\nThe Basset's short legs are due to a form of dwarfism (see: Health). Their short stature can be deceiving; Bassets are surprisingly long and can reach things on table tops that other dogs of similar heights cannot. Because Bassets are so heavy and have such short legs, they are not able to hold themselves above water for very long when swimming, and should always be closely supervised in the water.\n\n\n==== Coat ====\nThe short-haired coat of a Basset is long, smooth and soft, and sheds constantly. Any hound coloration is acceptable, but this varies from country to country. They are usually Black, Tan and White tricolors or Tan and White bicolors. Tan can vary from reddish-brown and Red to Lemon. Lemon and White is less common color. Some Bassets are also classified as gray or blue - this colour is considered rare and undesirable.\nThe source of colour is the E Locus (MC1R), which has four alleles: EM, EG, E, and e. The EM, E and e alleles are present in the Basset Hounds. The E allele allows for the production of both red and black pigments, so is present with the majority of colour patterns in Basset Hounds.\nRed and Lemon colours are caused by the e allele of MC1R. The e allele is recessive, so red and lemon dogs are homozygous e/e.  Lemon dogs are lighter in colour than Reds, but the genetic mechanism that dilutes phaeomelanin in this instance is unknown. No black hairs will be present on either Red or Lemon dogs. If there are any black hairs, the dog is officially a tricolour.\n\nThe EM allele produces a black mask on the face that may extend up around the eyes and onto the ears. This pattern is most easily seen on Mahogany dogs, although any Basset colour pattern may express the EM allele, except for \"red and white\" or \"lemon and white\" due to e/e.Many Bassets have a clearly defined white blaze and a white tip to their tail, intended to aid hunters in finding their dogs when tracking through underbrush.\nLike all dogs, the Basset Hound's coat is naturally oily. The oil in their coat has a distinctive \"hound scent\", which is natural to the breed.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Basset Hound is a friendly, outgoing, and playful dog, tolerant of children and other pets. They are extremely vocal and famously devoted to tracking.  They are also widely known for being stubborn.  Prospective owners must be prepared to handle bassets firmly and patiently.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n=== Ears ===\nBasset Hounds have large pendulous ears (known as \"leathers\") that do not allow air to circulate inside them, unlike other breeds with erect or more open ears. Their ears must be cleaned inside and out frequently to avoid infections and ear mites.\n\n\n=== Short stature ===\nAccording to the Basset Hound Club of America, the height of a Basset should not exceed 14 inches or 36 cm.The Basset Hound's short stature is due to the genetic condition osteochondrodysplasia (meaning abnormal growth of both bone and cartilage). Dwarfism of this type in most animals is traditionally known as achondroplasia. Basset Hounds, Dachshunds and Bulldogs are a few of the dog breeds classified as Achondroplastic. This bone growth abnormality may be a predisposing factor in the development of elbow dysplasia seen in the breed, which leads to arthritis of the elbow joint.\n\n\n=== Other health issues ===\nIn addition to ear problems, basset hounds may be susceptible to eye issues. Because of their droopy eyes the area under the eyeball can collect dirt and become clogged with a mucus.Basset Hounds are prone to yeast infections in the folds around the mouth, where drool can collect without thoroughly drying out.Overweight Basset Hounds develop many serious health issues, including bone and joint injuries, Gastric Dilatation Volvulus and paralysis.\nThe only recent mortality and morbidity surveys of Basset Hounds are from the UK: a 1999 longevity survey with a small sample size of 10 deceased dogs and a 2004 UK Kennel Club health survey with a larger sample size of 142 deceased dogs and 226 live dogs. See Mortality and Morbidity below.\n\n\n=== Mortality ===\nMedian longevity of Basset Hounds is about 10.3 years in France and 11.3 years in the UK, which is a typical median longevity for purebred dogs and for breeds similar in size to Basset Hounds. The oldest of the 142 deceased dogs in the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey was 16.7 years.  Leading causes of death in the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey were cancer (31%), old age (13%), gastric dilatation volvulus (11%), and cardiac (8%).\n\n\n=== Morbidity ===\nAmong the 226 live Basset Hounds in the 2004 UKC survey, the most-common health issues noted by owners were dermatologic (such as dermatitis), reproductive, musculoskeletal (for example, arthritis and lameness), and gastrointestinal (for example, gastric dilatation volvulus and colitis). Basset Hounds are also prone to epilepsy, glaucoma, luxating patella, thrombopathia, Von Willebrand disease, hypothyroidism, hip dysplasia, and elbow dysplasia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe modern Basset Hound descends from French dogs that were bred in Great Britain in the late 1800s.\nThe earliest-known depictions of short-legged hunting dogs are engravings from the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. Mummified remains of short-legged dogs from that period have been uncovered in the Dog Catacombs of Saqqara, Egypt. Scent Hounds were used for hunting in both Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome.\n\n\n=== St Hubert's Hound ===\n\nThe basset type originated in France, and is descended from the 6th century hounds belonging to St Hubert of Belgium, which through breeding at the Benedictine Abbey of St. Hubert eventually became what is known as the St Hubert's Hound around 1000 AD. St Hubert's original hounds are descended from the Laconian (Spartan) Hound, one of four groups of dogs discerned from Greek representations and descriptions. These scent hounds were described as large, slow, 'short-legged and deep mouthed' dogs with a small head, straight nose, upright ears and long neck, and either tan with white markings or black with tan markings. Laconian Hounds were reputed to not give up the scent until they found their prey. They eventually found their way to Constantinople, and from there to Europe.\n\n\n=== France ===\n\nThe first mention of a \"basset\" dog appeared in La Venerie, an illustrated hunting text written by Jacques du Fouilloux in 1585.  The dogs in Fouilloux's text were used to hunt foxes and badgers. It is believed that the Basset type originated as a mutation in the litters of Norman Staghounds, a descendant of the St Hubert's Hound. These precursors were most likely bred back to the St. Hubert's Hound, among other derivative French hounds. Until after the French Revolution around the year 1789, hunting from horseback was the preserve of kings, large aristocratic families and of the country squires, and for this reason short-legged dogs were highly valued for hunting on foot.\nBasset-type hounds became popular during the reign of Emperor Napoleon III (r. 1852\u20131870). In 1853, Emmanuel Fremiet, \"the leading sculptor of animals in his day\" exhibited bronze sculptures of Emperor Napoleon III's basset hounds at the Paris Salon. Ten years later in 1863 at the first exhibition of dogs held in Paris, basset hounds attained international attention.The controlled breeding of the short haired basset began in France in the year 1870.  From the existing bassets, Count Le Couteulx of Canteleu fixed a utilitarian type with straight front legs known as the Chien d'Artois, whereas Mr. Louis Lane developed a more spectacular type, with crooked front legs, known as the Basset Normand. These were bred together to create the original Basset Art\u00e9sien Normand.\n\n\n=== England ===\nFrench basset hounds were being imported into England at least as early as the 1870s. While some of these dogs were certainly Basset Art\u00e9sien Normands, by the 1880s linebreeding had thrown back to a different heavier type. Everett Millais, who is considered to be the father of the modern Basset Hound, bred one such dog, Nicholas, to a Bloodhound bitch named Inoculation through artificial insemination in order to create a heavier basset in England in the 1890s. The litter was delivered by caesarean section, and the surviving pups were refined with French and English bassets. The first breed standard for what is now known as the Basset Hound was made in Great Britain at the end of 19th century. This standard was updated in 2010.\n\n\n== Hunting with bassets ==\nThe Basset Hound was bred to hunt, with a keen nose and short stature suited to small-game hunting on foot. A variety of Basset Hound developed purely for hunting by Colonel Morrison was admitted to the Masters of Basset Hounds Association in 1959 via an Appendix to the Stud Book. This breed differs in being straighter and longer in the leg and having shorter ears.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nBasset Hounds have been featured in popular culture many times. Some artists, such as director Mamoru Oshii and webcomic artist Scott Kurtz regularly feature their pet Bassets in their work.\nOn February 27, 1928, Time magazine featured a basset hound on the front cover. The accompanying story was about the 52nd annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show at Madison Square Garden as if observed by the basset hound puppy.\nMany cartoon dogs are based on the Basset, such as Droopy, with several Bassets appearing in animated Disney films. Syndicated comic strip Fred Basset has been a regular feature in newspapers since 1963.\nThere is a Basset Hound in the Smokey and the Bandit movie series. The dog, Fred, was personally picked by lead actor Burt Reynolds because it refused to obey commands.In the TV series The Dukes of Hazzard, a Basset Hound called Flash served as a companion to Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane.\nIn the early days of television, Elvis Presley famously sang \"Hound Dog\" to a disinterested top hat-wearing basset hound named Sherlock on The Steve Allen Show on July 1, 1956. Lassie had a Basset friend named Pokey early in the Lassie television series. Other famous TV Bassets are the wisecracking Cleo from The People's Choice, Columbo's dog Dog, and the sheriff's dog Flash in The Dukes of Hazzard.\nBasset Hounds are often used as advertising logos. The logo for Hush Puppies brand shoes prominently features a Basset Hound whose real name is Jason.  Basset hounds are occasionally referred to as \"hush puppies\" for that reason. A basset hound also serves as the companion to the lonely Maytag Man in Maytag appliance advertisements. Tidewater Petroleum advertised its \"Flying A\" gasoline using a basset hound named Axelrod.\n\n\n== Related breeds ==\nAlbany and West Lodge Bassets\nBasset Artesien Normand\nBasset Bleu de Gascogne\nBasset Fauve de Bretagne\nGrand Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9en\nPetit Basset Griffon Vend\u00e9en\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBasset Hound at Curlie\u2014An active listing of Basset Hound links"}, {"id": 54, "name": "Bavarian Mountain Hound", "country": "Germany", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog54", "description": "The Bavarian Mountain Hound (German = \"Bayerischer Gebirgsschwei\u00dfhund\") is a breed of dog from Germany. As a scent hound, it has been used in Germany since the early 20th century to trail wounded game. It is a cross between the Bavarian Hound and the Hanover Hound.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Bavarian Mountain Hound's head is strong and elongated. The skull is relatively broad and slightly domed. It has a pronounced stop and a slightly curved nosebridge. The muzzle should be broad with solid jaws, and its lips fully covering the mouth. Its nose is black or dark red with wide nostrils. Its ears are high set and medium in length. They are broader at the base and rounded at the tips, hanging heavily against the head. Its body is slightly longer than it is tall and slightly raised at the rump. The neck medium in length, strong, with a slight dewlap. Topline sloping slightly upward from withers to hindquarters. Chest well-developed, long, moderately wide, and well let-down with a slight tuck-up. It has a long, fairly straight croup and solid back. While its tail is set on high, medium in length and hanging to the hock, carried level to the ground or hanging down.\n\n\n=== Size ===\nBavarian Mountain Hounds weigh between 20 and 25 kg, males are 47 to 52 cm (18.5 to 20.5 in) high, while females are 44 to 48 cm (17.5 to 19 in).\n\n\n=== Coat and color ===\nThe coat is short, thick and shiny, lying very flat against the body, and moderately harsh. It is finer on the head and ears, harsher and longer on the abdomen, legs, and tail. Its coat can come in all shades of black-masked fawn or brindle.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nBavarian Mountain Hounds are calm, quiet, poised, and very attached to their masters and family. When hunting, they are hard, single-minded, and persistent, courageous, spirited, fast, and agile, they are at ease on a rugged terrain, with a superb nose and powerful hunting instinct. However, they need a patient, experienced trainer.\n\n\n== Care ==\nThe Bavarian Mountain is not suited for city life. It is in regular need of space and exercise and also requires regular brushing. They are not dogs for the casual hunter. Most are owned and used by foresters and game wardens.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Bavarian Mountain Dog specialises in tracking injured big game following the traces of blood the prey loses after being shot. This hunting discipline comes from the Middle Ages. The weapons used then were imprecise and the animals were frequently wounded and not killed so the dogs were necessary to track them. Gaston Ph\u00e9bus wrote in 1387: \n\n\u201cIt is a great amusement and a really nice hunt when you have a tracking dog and a good dog for the blood\u2026\u201dThe Germans were really meticulous in order not to lose any prey and developed a technique for which they bred resistant dogs with a great sense of smell, a strong bone structure, dropping ears and a steady temperament. These dogs were medium-sized and reliable.\nThe Bavarian Mountain Dog was developed in the 19th century by crossbreeding specimens of the Hannoversche Schwei\u00dfhund breed and hunting dogs from the Alps. The result was a hunting dog ideal for the work in the mountains. In 1912, the \"Klub f\u00fcr Bayrische Gebirgsschwei\u00dfhunde\", (Club for Bavarian Mountain hound), was founded in Munich. Afterwards, this breed started gaining popularity in Austria and Hungary.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 55, "name": "Beagle", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog55", "description": "The beagle is a breed of small hound that is similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The beagle is a scent hound, developed primarily for hunting hare (beagling). With a great sense of smell and superior tracking instinct, the beagle is employed as detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent but single-minded. It is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and lack of inherited health problems.\nAlthough beagle-type dogs have existed for 2,500 years, the modern breed was developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot Hound, the North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, and possibly the Harrier.\nBeagles have been depicted in popular culture since Elizabethan times in literature and paintings, and more recently in film, television, and comic books. Snoopy of the comic strip Peanuts has been called \"the world's most famous beagle\".\n\n\n== History ==\nDogs of similar size and purpose to the modern beagle can be traced in Ancient Greece\nback to around the 5th century BC. Xenophon, born around 430 BC, in his Treatise on Hunting or Cynegeticus refers to a hound that hunted hares by scent and was followed on foot. Small hounds are mentioned in the Forest Laws of Canute which exempted them from the ordinance which commanded that all dogs capable of running down a stag should have one foot mutilated. If genuine, these laws would confirm that beagle-type dogs were present in England before 1016, but it is likely the laws were written in the Middle Ages to give a sense of antiquity and tradition to Forest Law.\n\nIn the 11th century, William the Conqueror brought the Talbot hound to Britain. The Talbot was a predominantly white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound derived from the St. Hubert Hound which had been developed in the 8th century. At some point the English Talbots were crossed with Greyhounds to give them an extra turn of speed. Long extinct, the Talbot strain probably gave rise to the Southern Hound which, in turn, is thought to be an ancestor of the modern-day beagle.\nFrom medieval times, beagle was used as a generic description for the smaller hounds, though these dogs differed considerably from the modern breed. Miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times of Edward II and Henry VII, who both had packs of Glove Beagles, so named since they were small enough to fit on a glove, and Queen Elizabeth I kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood 8 to 9 inches (20 to 23 cm) at the shoulder. Small enough to fit in a \"pocket\" or saddlebag, they rode along on the hunt. The larger hounds would run the prey to ground, then the hunters would release the small dogs to continue the chase through underbrush. Elizabeth I referred to the dogs as her singing beagles and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her Pocket Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups. 19th-century sources refer to these breeds interchangeably and it is possible that the two names refer to the same small variety. In George Jesse's Researches into the History of the British Dog from 1866, the early 17th-century poet and writer Gervase Markham is quoted referring to the beagle as small enough to sit on a man's hand and to the: little small mitten-beagle, which may be companion for a ladies kirtle, and in the field will run as cunningly as any hound whatere, only their musick is very small like reeds. Standards for the Pocket Beagle were drawn up as late as 1901; these genetic lines are now extinct, although modern breeders have attempted to recreate the variety.\nBy the 18th century two breeds had been developed for hunting hare and rabbit: the Southern Hound and the North Country Beagle (or Northern Hound). The Southern Hound, a tall, heavy dog with a square head, and long, soft ears, was common from south of the River Trent and probably closely related to the Talbot Hound. Though slow, it had stamina and an excellent scenting ability. The North Country Beagle, possibly a cross between an offshoot of the Talbot stock and a Greyhound, was bred chiefly in Yorkshire and was common in the northern counties. It was smaller than the Southern Hound, less heavy-set and with a more pointed muzzle. It was faster than its southern counterpart but its scenting abilities were less well developed. As fox hunting became increasingly popular, numbers of both types of hound diminished. The beagle-type dogs were crossed with larger breeds such as Stag Hounds to produce the modern Foxhound. The beagle-size varieties came close to extinction but some farmers in the South ensured the survival of the prototype breeds by maintaining small rabbit-hunting packs.\n\n\n=== Development of the modern breed ===\nReverend Phillip Honeywood established a beagle pack in Essex in the 1830s and it is believed that this pack formed the basis for the modern breed. Although details of the pack's lineage are not recorded it is thought that North Country Beagles and Southern Hounds were strongly represented; William Youatt suspected that Harriers formed a good majority of the beagle's bloodline, but the origin of the Harrier is itself obscure. Honeywood's Beagles were small, standing at about 10 inches (25 cm) at the shoulder, and pure white according to John Mills (writing in The Sportsman's Library in 1845). Prince Albert and Lord Winterton also had Beagle packs around this time, and royal favour no doubt led to some revival of interest in the breed, but Honeywood's pack was regarded as the finest of the three.\n\nAlthough credited with the development of the modern breed, Honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and it was left to Thomas Johnson to refine the breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters. Two strains were developed: the rough- and smooth-coated varieties. The rough-coated beagle survived until the beginning of the 20th century, and there were even records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as 1969, but this variety is now extinct, having probably been absorbed into the standard beagle bloodline.In the 1840s, a standard beagle type was beginning to develop; the distinction between the North Country Beagle and Southern Hound had been lost, but there was still a large variation in size, character, and reliability among the emerging packs. In 1856, \"Stonehenge\" (the pseudonym of John Henry Walsh), writing in the Manual of British Rural Sports, was still dividing beagles into four varieties: the medium beagle; the dwarf or lapdog beagle; the fox beagle (a smaller, slower version of the Foxhound); and the rough-coated or terrier beagle, which he classified as a cross between any of the other varieties and one of the Scottish terrier breeds. Stonehenge also gives the start of a standard description:\n\nIn size the beagle measures from 10 inches, or even less, to 15. In shape they resemble the old southern hound in miniature, but with more neatness and beauty; and they also resemble that hound in style of hunting.\nBy 1887 the threat of extinction was on the wane: there were 18 beagle packs in England. The Beagle Club was formed in 1890 and the first standard drawn up at the same time. The following year the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles was formed. Both organisations aimed to further the best interests of the breed, and both were keen to produce a standard type of beagle. By 1902, the number of packs had risen to 44.\n\n\n=== Export ===\nBeagles were in the United States by the 1840s at the latest, but the first dogs were imported strictly for hunting and were of variable quality. Since Honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s, it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight-legged Dachshunds with weak heads has little resemblance to the standard. Serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline began in the early 1870s when General Richard Rowett from Illinois imported some dogs from England and began breeding. Rowett's Beagles are believed to have formed the models for the first American standard, drawn up by Rowett, L. H. Twadell, and Norman Ellmore in 1887. The beagle was accepted as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885. In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide.\n\n\n=== Birth and Reproduction ===\nThe average size of a beagle litter is six puppies. When mother beagles give birth to litters of puppies, the little rats weigh just a few ounces each.\n\n\n== Popularity ==\n\nOn its formation, the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles took over the running of a regular show at Peterborough that had started in 1889, and the Beagle Club in the UK held its first show in 1896. The regular showing of the breed led to the development of a uniform type, and the beagle continued to prove a success up until the outbreak of World War I when all shows were suspended. After the war, the breed was again struggling for survival in the UK: the last of the Pocket Beagles was probably lost during this time, and registrations fell to an all-time low. A few breeders (notably Reynalton Kennels) managed to revive interest in the dog and by World War II, the breed was once again doing well. Registrations dropped again after the end of the war but almost immediately recovered.As purebred dogs, beagles have always been more popular in the United States and Canada than in their native country England. The National Beagle Club of America was formed in 1888 and by 1901 a beagle had won a Best in Show title. As in the UK, activity during World War I was minimal, but the breed showed a much stronger revival in the U.S. when hostilities ceased. In 1928 it won a number of prizes at the Westminster Kennel Club's show and by 1939 a beagle \u2013 Champion Meadowlark Draughtsman \u2013 had captured the title of top-winning American-bred dog for the year.  On 12 February 2008, a beagle, K-Run's Park Me In First (Uno), won the Best In Show category at the Westminster Kennel Club show for the first time in the competition's history. In North America they have been consistently in the top-ten most-popular breeds for over 30 years. From 1953 to 1959 the beagle was ranked No. 1 on the list of the American Kennel Club's registered breeds; in 2005 and 2006 it ranked 5th out of the 155 breeds registered. In the UK they are not quite so popular, placing 28th and 30th in the rankings of registrations with the Kennel Club in 2005 and 2006 respectively. In the United States the beagle ranked 4th most popular breed in 2012 and 2013, behind the Labrador Retriever (#1), German Shepherd (#2) and Golden Retriever (#3) breeds.\n\n\n== Name ==\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first mention of the beagle by name in English literature dates from c. 1475 in The Squire of Low Degree. The origin of the word \"beagle\" is uncertain, although it has been suggested that the word derives from the French begueule.It is not known why the black and tan Kerry Beagle, present in Ireland since Celtic times, has the beagle description, since at 22 to 24 inches (56 to 61 cm) it is significantly taller than the modern day beagle, and in earlier times was even larger. Some writers suggest that the beagle's scenting ability may have come from cross-breeding earlier strains with the Kerry Beagle. Originally used for hunting stags, it is today used for hare and drag hunting.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe general appearance of the beagle resembles a miniature Foxhound, but the head is broader and the muzzle shorter, the expression completely different and the legs shorter in proportion to the body.  They are generally between 13 and 16 inches (33 and 41 cm) high at the withers and weigh between 18 and 35 lb (8.2 and 15.9 kg), with females being slightly smaller than males on average.They have a smooth, somewhat domed skull with a medium-length, square-cut muzzle and a black (or occasionally liver) gumdrop nose. The jaw is strong and the teeth scissor together with the upper teeth fitting perfectly over the lower teeth and both sets aligned square to the jaw. The eyes are large, hazel or brown, with a mild hound-like pleading look. The large ears are long, soft and low-set, turning towards the cheeks slightly and rounded at the tips. Beagles have a strong, medium-length neck (which is long enough for them to easily bend to the ground to pick up a scent), with little folding in the skin but some evidence of a dewlap; a broad chest narrowing to a tapered abdomen and waist and a long, slightly curved tail (known as the \"stern\") tipped with white. The white tip, known as the flag has been selectively bred for, as it allows the dog to be easily seen when its head is down following a scent. The tail does not curl over the back, but is held upright when the dog is active. The beagle has a muscular body and a medium-length, smooth, hard coat. The front legs are straight and carried under the body while the rear legs are muscular and well bent at the stifles.The tricolored beagle\u2014white with large black areas and light brown shading\u2014is the most common.  Tricolored beagles occur in a number of shades, from the \"Classic Tri\" with a jet black saddle (also known as \"Blackback\"), to the \"Dark Tri\" (where faint brown markings are intermingled with more prominent black markings), to the \"Faded Tri\" (where faint black markings are intermingled with more prominent brown markings). Some tricolored dogs have a broken pattern, sometimes referred to as pied. These dogs have mostly white coats with patches of black and brown hair. Tricolor beagles are almost always born black and white. The white areas are typically set by eight weeks, but the black areas may fade to brown as the puppy matures.  (The brown may take between one and two years to fully develop.) Some beagles gradually change color during their lives, and may lose their black markings entirely.\n\nTwo-color varieties always have a white base color with areas of the second color. Tan and white is the most common two-color variety, but there is a wide range of other colors including lemon, a very light tan; red, a reddish, almost orange, brown; and liver, a darker brown, and black. Liver is not common and is not permitted in some standards; it tends to occur with yellow eyes. Ticked or mottled varieties may be either white or black with different colored flecks (ticking), such as the blue-mottled or bluetick beagle, which has spots that appear to be a midnight-blue color, similar to the coloring of the Bluetick Coonhound. Some tricolor beagles also have ticking of various colors in their white areas.\n\n\n== Sense of smell ==\nAlongside the Bloodhound and Basset Hound, the beagle has one of the best developed senses of smell of any dog. In the 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behavior. As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a one-acre field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it. The beagles found it in less than a minute, while Fox Terriers took 15 minutes and Scottish Terriers failed to find it at all. Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting, and for this reason they have been excluded from most mountain rescue teams in favor of collies, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable. The long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose.\n\n\n== Variations ==\n\n\n=== Breed varieties ===\nThe American Kennel Club recognizes two separate varieties of beagle: the 13-inch for hounds less than 13 inches (33 cm), and the 15-inch for those between 13 and 15 inches (33 and 38 cm). The Canadian Kennel Club recognizes a single type, with a height not exceeding 15 inches (38 cm).  The Kennel Club (UK) and FCI affiliated clubs recognize a single type, with a height of between 13 and 16 inches (33 and 41 cm).\n\nEnglish and American varieties are sometimes mentioned. However, there is no official recognition from any Kennel Club for this distinction. Beagles fitting the American Kennel Club standard \u2013 which disallows animals over 15 inches (38 cm) \u2013 are smaller on average than those fitting the Kennel Club standard which allows heights up to 16 inches (41 cm).\nPocket Beagles are sometimes advertised for sale but while the UK Kennel Club originally specified a standard for the Pocket Beagle in 1901, the variety is now not recognized by any Kennel Club.\nA strain known as Patch Hounds was developed by Willet Randall and his family from 1896 specifically for their rabbit hunting ability. They trace their bloodline back to Field Champion Patch, but do not necessarily have a patchwork marking.\n\n\n=== Crossbreeds ===\nIn the 1850s, Stonehenge recommended a cross between a Beagle and a Scottish Terrier as a retriever. He found the crossbreed to be a good worker, silent and obedient, but it had the drawback that it was small and could barely carry a hare.More recently the trend has been for \"designer dogs\" and one of the most popular has been the Beagle/Pug cross known as a Puggle. Some puppies of this cross are less excitable than a Beagle and with a lower exercise requirement, similar to the Pug parent; but many are highly excitable and require vigorous exercise.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe beagle has an even temper and gentle disposition. Described in several breed standards as \"merry\", they are amiable and typically neither aggressive nor timid, although this depends on the individual. They enjoy company, and although they may initially be standoffish with strangers, they are easily won over. They make poor guard dogs for this reason, although their tendency to bark or howl when confronted with the unfamiliar makes them good watch dogs. In a 1985 study conducted by Ben and Lynette Hart, the beagle was given the highest excitability rating, along with the Yorkshire Terrier, Cairn Terrier, Miniature Schnauzer, West Highland White Terrier, and Fox Terrier.Beagles are intelligent but, as a result of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.\n\nBeagles are excellent with children and this is one of the reasons they have became popular family pets. But as beagles are pack animals, they are prone to separation anxiety, a condition which causes them to destroy things when left unattended.  Not all beagles will howl, but most will bark when confronted with strange situations, and some will bay (also referred to as \"speaking\", \"giving tongue\", or \"opening\") when they catch the scent of potential quarry. They also generally get along well with cats and other dogs. They are not too demanding with regard to exercise; their inbred stamina means they do not easily tire when exercised, but they also do not need to be worked to exhaustion before they will rest. Regular exercise helps ward off the weight gain to which the breed is prone.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThe typical longevity of beagles is 12\u201315 years, which is a common lifespan for dogs of their size.Beagles may be prone to epilepsy, but this can often be controlled with medication. Hypothyroidism and a number of types of dwarfism occur in beagles. Two conditions in particular are unique to the breed: \"Funny Puppy\", in which the puppy is slow to develop and eventually develops weak legs, a crooked back and although normally healthy, is prone to a range of illnesses; Hip dysplasia, common in Harriers and in some larger breeds, is rarely considered a problem in beagles. Beagles are considered a chondrodystrophic breed, meaning that they are prone to types of disk diseases.\n\nIn rare cases, beagles may develop immune mediated polygenic arthritis (where the immune system attacks the joints) even at a young age. The symptoms can sometimes be relieved by steroid treatments. Another rare disease in the breed is neonatal cerebellar cortical degeneration. Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often and don't have a normal gait. It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%. A genetic test is available.\n\nTheir long floppy ears can mean that the inner ear does not receive a substantial air flow or that moist air becomes trapped, and this can lead to ear infections. Beagles may also be affected by a range of eye problems; two common ophthalmic conditions in beagles are glaucoma and corneal dystrophy. \"Cherry eye\", a prolapse of the gland of the third eyelid, and distichiasis, a condition in which eyelashes grow into the eye causing irritation, sometimes exist; both these conditions can be corrected with surgery. They can suffer from several types of retinal atrophy. Failure of the nasolacrimal drainage system can cause dry eye or leakage of tears onto the face.As field dogs they are prone to minor injuries such as cuts and sprains, and, if inactive, obesity is a common problem as they will eat whenever food is available and rely on their owners to regulate their weight. When working or running free they are also likely to pick up parasites such as fleas, ticks, harvest mites, and tapeworms, and irritants such as grass seeds can become trapped in their eyes, soft ears, or paws.Beagles may exhibit a behaviour known as reverse sneezing, in which they sound as if they are choking or gasping for breath, but are actually drawing air in through the mouth and nose. The exact cause of this behaviour is not known, but it can be a common occurrence and is not harmful to the dog.\n\n\n== Hunting ==\n\nBeagles were developed primarily for hunting hare, an activity known as beagling. They were seen as ideal hunting companions for the elderly who could follow on horseback without exerting themselves, for young hunters who could keep up with them on ponies, and for the poorer hunters who could not afford to maintain a stable of good hunting horses. Before the advent of the fashion for foxhunting in the 19th century, hunting was an all day event where the enjoyment was derived from the chase rather than the kill. In this setting the tiny beagle was well matched to the hare, as unlike Harriers they would not quickly finish the hunt, but because of their excellent scent-tracking skills and stamina they were almost guaranteed to eventually catch the hare. The beagle packs would run closely together (\"so close that they might be covered with a sheet\") which was useful in a long hunt, as it prevented stray dogs from obscuring the trail. In thick undergrowth they were also preferred to spaniels when hunting pheasant.With the fashion for faster hunts, the beagle fell out of favour for chasing hare, but was still employed for rabbit hunting. In Anecdotes of Dogs (1846), Edward Jesse says:\n\nIn rabbit-shooting, in gorse and thick cover, nothing can be more cheerful than the beagle. They also are easily heard over long distances and in thick cover. They have been called rabbit-beagles from this employment, for which they are peculiarly qualified, especially those dogs which are somewhat wire-haired.\nIn the United States they appear to have been employed chiefly for hunting rabbits from the earliest imports.\nHunting hare with beagles became popular again in Britain in the mid-19th century and continued until it was made illegal in Scotland by the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 and in England and Wales by the Hunting Act 2004. Under this legislation beagles may still pursue rabbits with the landowner's permission. Drag hunting is popular where hunting is no longer permitted or for those owners who do not wish to participate in hunting a live animal, but still wish to exercise their dog's innate skills.\nThe traditional foot pack consists of up to 40 beagles, marshaled by a Huntsman who directs the pack and who is assisted by a variable number of whippers-in whose job is to return straying hounds to the pack. The Master of the Hunt is in overall day-to-day charge of the pack, and may or may not take on the role of Huntsman on the day of the hunt.\nAs hunting with beagles was seen as ideal for young people, many of the British public schools traditionally maintained beagle packs. Protests were lodged against Eton's use of beagles for hunting as early as 1902 but the pack is still in existence today, and a pack used by Imperial College in Wye, Kent was stolen by the Animal Liberation Front in 2001. School and university packs are still maintained by Eton, Marlborough, Wye, Radley, the Royal Agricultural University and Christ Church, Oxford.In addition to organized beagling, beagles have been used for hunting or flushing to guns (often in pairs) a wide range of game including snowshoe hare, cottontail rabbits, game birds, roe deer, red deer, bobcat, coyote, wild boar and foxes, and have even been recorded as being used to hunt stoat. In most of these cases, the beagle is employed as a gun dog, flushing game for hunter's guns.\n\n\n== Detection ==\n\nBeagles are used as detection dogs in the Beagle Brigade of the United States Department of Agriculture. These dogs are used to detect food items in luggage being taken into the United States. After trialling several breeds, beagles were chosen because they are relatively small and unintimidating for people who are uncomfortable around dogs, easy to care for, intelligent and work well for rewards. They are also used for this purpose in a number of other countries including by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in New Zealand, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, and in Canada, Japan and the People's Republic of China. Larger breeds are generally used for detection of explosives as this often involves climbing over luggage and on large conveyor belts, work for which the smaller Beagle is not suited.\n\n\n== Testing ==\nBeagles are the dog breed most often used in animal testing, due to their size and passive nature. In the United States, as many as 65,000 beagles are used every year for medical, cosmetic, beauty, and other chemical tests. They are purpose bred and live their lives in cages undergoing experiments. The Rescue + Freedom Project (formerly Beagle Freedom Project) has successfully advocated for beagles to be released from labs. This organization has freed hundreds of animals.Beagles are used in a range of research procedures: fundamental biological research, applied human medicine, applied veterinary medicine, and protection of man, animals or the environment. Of the 8,018 dogs used in testing in the UK in 2004, 7,799 were beagles (97.3%). In the UK, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 gave special status to primates, equids, cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals were involved. In 2005 beagles were involved in less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals in the UK, but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved beagles (96.6%). Most dogs are bred specifically for this purpose, by companies such as Harlan. In the UK companies breeding animals for research must be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.Testing of cosmetic products on animals is banned in the member states of the European Community, although France protested the ban and has made efforts to have it lifted. It is permitted in the United States but is not mandatory if safety can be ascertained by other methods, and the test species is not specified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). When testing toxicity of food additives, food contaminants, and some drugs and chemicals the FDA uses beagles and miniature pigs as surrogates for direct human testing. Minnesota was the first state to enact a Beagle freedom adoption law in 2014, mandating that dogs and cats are allowed to be adopted once they have completed with research testing.Anti-vivisection groups have reported on abuse of animals inside testing facilities. In 1997 footage secretly filmed by a freelance journalist inside Huntingdon Life Sciences in the UK showed staff punching and screaming at beagles. Consort Kennels, a UK-based breeder of beagles for testing, closed down in 1997 after pressure from animal rights groups.\n\n\n== Other roles ==\nAlthough bred for hunting, Beagles are versatile and are nowadays employed for various other roles in detection, therapy, and as family pets.Beagles are used as sniffer dogs for termite detection in Australia, and have been mentioned as possible candidates for drug and explosive detection. Because of their gentle nature and unimposing build, they are also frequently used in pet therapy, visiting the sick and elderly in hospital. In June 2006, a trained Beagle assistance dog was credited with saving the life of its owner after using her owner's mobile phone to dial an emergency number.  In the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, a Beagle search and rescue dog with a Colombian rescue squad was credited with locating the owner of the H\u00f4tel Montana, who was subsequently rescued after spending 100 hours buried in the rubble. Beagles were hired by New York City to help with bedbug detection, while the role of such dogs in this type of detection may have doubts.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nBeagles have been featured across a wide range of media. References to the dog appear before the 19th century in works by such writers as William Shakespeare, John Webster, John Dryden, Thomas Tickell, Henry Fielding, and William Cowper, as well as in Alexander Pope's translation of Homer's Iliad. Beagles appeared in funny animal comic strips and animated cartoons from the 1950s with Courage the Cowardly Dog and the Peanuts character Snoopy was billed as \"the world's most famous Beagle\". In Disney's Donald Duck universe, the Beagle Boys are a clan of criminal anthropomorphic beagles.\nFormer US President Lyndon Baines Johnson had several beagles, and caused an outcry when he picked up one of them by its ears during an official greeting on the White House lawn. In the 1998 film Babe: Pig in the City, Snoop, the airport security sniffer who falsely senses that Mrs. Hoggett might carrying illegal substances, is a beagle. Beagles are also the only breed of dog that appear in Wes Anderson's 2009 film Fantastic Mr. Fox. The ship on which Charles Darwin made the voyage which provided much of the inspiration for On the Origin of Species was named HMS Beagle after the breed, and, in turn, lent its name to the ill-fated British Martian lander Beagle 2. A Canadian bred 15 inch female Beagle with the registered name of Gr Ch Tashtins Lookin For Trouble and the pet name of \"Miss P\" won the 2015 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. Japanese idol sisters Tomu and Orin Muto of AKB48 have a beagle who often accompanies their online appearances.\n\n\n== Notable Beagles ==\nFrodo, awarded the PDSA Gold Medal for animal bravery\n\n\n== References ==\nInformational notes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\nArnold, David and Hazel (1998).

It is a breed of dog originating from France.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Beagle-Harrier appears to be either a large Beagle or a small Harrier. It is a medium-sized dog, between 45 and 50 centimeters (18 and 20 inches) tall at the withers, and it weighs between 19 and 21 kilograms (42 and 46 pounds).\nIts coat is usually tricolor, featuring the colors fawn, black, tan, or white. There are also grey-coated (tricolor) Beagle-Harriers. The Beagle-Harrier's body is usually muscular and its coat smooth and thick.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Beagle-Harrier is generally good with children and other pets. They are loyal, have lots of determination and making them a good family pet. They are a hunting breed and so require a lot of exercise and space.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Beagle Harrier is generally very healthy and has a life span of 12 to 13 years. Hip dysplasia could cause a big problem.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Beagle-Harrier breed is old, with its origins unclear; they were initially bred to hunt rabbits and other small animals. They were popular in England since the early 14th century and were later imported into America in the mid-1800s to hunt rabbits.Beagle-Harriers were bred in France in the 19th century by Baron Gerard. The Beagle Harrier could be a mixture of two breeds, the Beagle and the Harrier, or the midpoint in breeding between the two breeds.\nIt was recognized by the FCI in 1974.The Beagle-Harrier can now be quite rarely found in France and is even more rare in other countries.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBeagle\nHarrier\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nClub du Beagle, de Beagle Harrier et du Harrier (In French)"}, {"id": 57, "name": "Bearded Collie", "country": "United Kingdom, Scotland", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog57", "description": "The Bearded Collie, or Beardie, is a herding breed of dog once used primarily by Scottish shepherds, but now mostly a popular family companion.\nBearded Collies have an average weight of 18\u201327 kilograms (40\u201360 lb). Males are around 53\u201356 centimetres (21\u201322 in) tall at the withers while females are around 51\u201353 centimetres (20\u201321 in) tall.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Bearded Collie's history is a combination of fact and legend. Kazimierz Grabski, a Polish merchant, reportedly traded a shipment of grain for sheep in Scotland in 1514 and brought six Polish Lowland Sheepdogs to move them. A Scottish shepherd was so impressed with the herding ability of the dogs that he traded several sheep for several dogs. The Polish sheepdogs were bred with local Scottish dogs to produce the Bearded Collie.\nIt is generally agreed that Mrs. G. Olive Willison founded the modern Bearded Collie in 1944 with her brown bitch, Jeannie of Bothkennar. Jeannie was supposedly a Shetland Sheepdog, but Mrs. Willison received a Bearded Collie by accident. She was so fascinated by the dog that she wanted to begin breeding, so she began searching for a dog for Jeannie. While walking along the beach, Mrs. Willison met a man who was emigrating from Scotland; she became the owner of his grey dog, David, who became Bailie of Bothkennar.\nBailie and Jeannie of Bothkennar are the founders of the modern breed; there are only a few other registrable blood lines, preserved in large part by the perseverance of Mr. Nicolas Broadbridge (Sallen) and Mrs. Betty Foster (Bredon). These are based on Turnbull's Blue\u2014a Bearded Collie from pure working stock, registered in ISDS when ISDS still registered non-Border Collies. He sired three litters of registerable Bearded Collies.\nThe breed became popular during the last half of the 20th century\u2014propelled, in part, by Potterdale Classic at Moonhill, a Bearded Collie who won Best in Show at Crufts in 1989. The Bearded Collie Club celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2005. The bearded collie is also very good natured and is good as a family pet and a working dog and a show dog.\n\n\n== As pets ==\n\nThe Bearded Collie ranks 117 out of 175 breeds in popularity in the United States, according to the American Kennel Club's yearly breed ranking. A Bearded Collie is best obtained from a reputable breeder or a dog rescue. There are Beardie rescue associations, such as Beardie Collie Rescue and \"Rescue Me\". These organisations attempt to place unwanted puppies and dogs into appropriate, loving homes. Most Bearded Collie breeders take great care in breeding, raising and placing their puppies. Due to this, Bearded Collies are considered an \"unspoiled\" breed.Bearded Collies make excellent pets for those willing to accommodate their high energy level - they are very enthusiastic and have a bouncy nature.  They also require regular grooming; weekly brushing is mandatory for keeping their long hair mat-free. Some Bearded Collie owners opt to keep their pets in a \"puppy cut\" haircut, which reduces (but does not eliminate) the need for brushing. Bearded Collies are an energetic breed, originally intended to work in the Scottish Highlands herding sheep; they also excel at treibball, dog agility and Obedience trials. A loyal and family-friendly dog, the Beardie can add years of pet-ownership enjoyment to the home. They have keen problem-solving abilities, and are entertaining to watch.\nIn training, beardies can be independent, they will go from A to B but maybe not via the expected route. One of the most common problems for new Beardie owners is the breed's intelligence makes them prone to get quickly fed up if training gets too repetitive.\n\n\n== Working life ==\n\nThe Bearded Collie is used to herd both sheep and cattle. It is essentially a working dog\u2014bred to be hardy and reliable, able to stand up to the harshest conditions and the toughest sheep. The working Bearded Collie has become less common in the last few decades and risked dying out; however, thanks to the efforts of a few shepherds like Tom Muirhead and Peter Wood, \nthe \"working Beardie\" has survived and is becoming more popular. It has been exported to Australia and the United States, and finds favour among those looking for an independent and intelligent sheepdog. The Working Bearded Collie Society's mission is to preserve the working abilities of non-registered working dogs from \"bearded\" ancestors. The website Shepherds with beardies has much valuable information on the small population of working Beardies.\nThe KC-registered Bearded Collie has fallen into disfavour with the shepherds of Wales, Scotland and elsewhere because of the show-breeding community's lack of interest in producing \"hardy and reliable\" animals; show-bred lines tend to develop excessive coats, in particular. However, in some countries (notably Sweden and the United States) herding programmes have been developed for the breed. The breed organisations in those countries actively encourage breeders to emphasise qualities other than appearance.\n\nThe Bearded Collie may have earned its nickname \"bouncing Beardie\" because the dogs would work in thick underbrush on hillsides; they would bounce to catch sight of the sheep. Beardies also have a characteristic way of facing a stubborn ewe, barking and bouncing on the forelegs. Whatever the reason, a typical Bearded Collie is an enthusiastic herding dog which requires structure and care; it moves stock with body, bark and bounce as required. Very few Beardies show \"eye\" when working; most are upright. \nHerding instincts and tractability can be assessed in noncompetitive herding tests. Beardies exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThe size of an average litter is seven pups.\n\n\n=== Mortality ===\nThe median longevity (the age at which half of the population has died and half is still alive) of Bearded Collies from recent UK and USA/Canada surveys (the weighted average of all surveys) is 12.8 years; Beardies  in the UK surveys lived longer (median ~13.4 years) than their USA/Canada counterparts (median 12.0 years). Most purebred breeds have median longevities between 10 and 13 years and most breeds similar in size to Bearded Collies have median longevities between 11 and 13 years, so the lifespan of Bearded Collies appears to be on the high end compared with other breeds (at least in the UK). Individual dogs may die much earlier or later than the median. In a 1996 USA/Canada survey, 32% of Beardies died (including accidental deaths) before the age of nine; however, 12% lived longer than 14 years. The eldest of the 278 deceased dogs in the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey died at 19.5 years; the age at death of the oldest dog in the USA/Canada survey was not reported.\nLeading causes of death among Beardies in the UK are old age (26%), cancer (19%), cerebrovascular disease (9%), and chronic kidney failure (8%). Leading causes of death among Beardies in the US and Canada are old age (18%), cancer (17%), kidney failure (8%), cerebrovascular disease (4%) and hypoadrenocorticism (4%).\n\n\n=== Morbidity ===\nBearded Collie owners in the UK reported that the most common health issues among living dogs were musculoskeletal\u2014mostly arthritis and cruciate ligament rupture (CLR)\u2014gastrointestinal (primarily colitis and diarrhea) and urologic diseases. Beardie owners in the US and Canada reported that the most common health problems were hypothyroidism, cancer, hypoadrenocorticism (also known as Addison's disease), arthritis and skin problems. Morbidity in the two studies is not easily compared, however; the UK report grouped diseases, while the USA/Canada report ranked more specific conditions.\nFurther existing breed dispositions of the Bearded Collie include: Dermatological conditions, such as pemphigus foliaceous and black skin disease, follicular dysplasia, musculoskeletal conditions such as congenital elbow luxation, ocular conditions, such as corneal dystrophy, cataract and generalized progressive retinal atrophy.\n\n\n=== Hypoadrenocorticism ===\n\nHypoadrenocorticism (also known as Addison's disease) is an inherited disease in Bearded Collies, although the mechanism of inheritance is not known. It occurs when the adrenal cortex produces insufficient glucocorticoid and/or mineralocorticoid hormones. It affects approximately 2\u20133.4% of Bearded Collies in the USA/Canada, and causes the death of at least 1% of Bearded Collies in the UK. These are much higher percentages than for the general dog population (0.1%), and hypoadrenocorticism causes a disproportionate number of deaths among young dogs. Early symptoms are vague and easily mistaken for other conditions. Symptoms include unexplained lethargy, frequent gastric disturbances, or an inability to tolerate stress. Untreated, hypoadrenocorticism can cause fatal sodium/potassium imbalances; with lifelong medication, most dogs can live a relatively normal life.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe role of Nana in the original production of the James Barrie play Peter Pan was performed by a Bearded Collie.\nA Bearded Collie named Coal featured in the 2006 film The Shaggy Dog starring Tim Allen.\nRalphie, a Bearded Collie, appears in the 2009 film, Hotel for Dogs.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBearded Collie at Curlie"}, {"id": 58, "name": "Beauceron", "country": "France", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog58", "description": "The Beauceron is a rabbit and herding dog breed falling into the working dog category whose origins lie in the plains of Central France. The Beauceron is also known as Berger de Beauce (sheepdog from Beauce) or  Bas Rouge (red-stockings).\n\n\n== History ==\nA French herding breed known for centuries in western Europe, the Beauceron is noted as one of the breeds used to create the Doberman Pinscher. Although quite different in appearance, the Beauceron and the long-haired sheep dog, the Briard, stem from similar ancestral stock, sharing the trait of double dewclaws on the hind legs. Both were used to herd sheep and cattle. Like the Beauceron, the Briard is found throughout northern France, and despite implications from its name, also did not come exclusively from the Brie region.\nIn 1809, Abb\u00e9 Rozier wrote an article on these French herding dogs, in which he described the differences in type and used the terms Berger de Brie and Berger de Beauce.\nIn 1893, the veterinarian Paul Megnin differentiated between the long-haired Berger de la Brie and the short-haired Berger de Beauce. He defined the standard of the breed, with the assistance of M. Emmanuel Ball. In 1922, the Club des Amis du Beauceron was formed under the guidance of Dr. Megnin.\nIn 2008, the Beauceron made its debut in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.\n\n\n=== History as a working breed ===\nA versatile breed, the Bas Rouge is used to both guard and herd sheep and cattle. It was once very useful against wolves, now long gone from central France. The breed served in both world wars as messenger dog, supply transport dog, land mine detection dog, search dog, police dog and rescue dog.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThis breed stands 61 to 70 cm (24 to 27.5 inches) in height and weighs 30 to 45 kg (66 to 100 pounds). The Beauceron has a hard outer coat and a woolly undercoat that grows thick in cold weather, especially if the dog sleeps outdoors. Its standard colouring is black and tan (the latter colour referred to in French as rouge ecureuil, squirrel-red) or grey, black and tan called harlequin. Other colours, such as the once prevalent tawny, grey or grey/black, are now banned by the breed standard. The merle coats should have more black than gray with no white. In the black and tan dogs the tan markings appear in two dots above the eyes, on the sides of the muzzle, fading off to the cheeks, but do not reach the underside of the ears. Also on the throat, under the tail and on the legs and the chest. Tan markings on the chest should appear as two spots but a chest plate is acceptable.\n\nAlthough most breeds may or may not have dewclaws (many owners of other breeds remove dewclaws, especially if the dog is used for field and hunting), an important feature of the Beauceron is the double dewclaw. In order to be shown, a beauceron must have double dewclaws that form well-separated \"thumbs\" with nails on each rear leg; anything less will result in disqualification from dog shows.Ear cropping is no longer allowed in Europe.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe Beauceron is known in France as a guard dog, a helper around the farm (herding sheep or cattle), and/or a ring sport dog (primarily protection training). This athletic, healthy and long-lived breed has been bred to be intelligent, calm, gentle, and fearless. Adults are typically suspicious of strangers and are excellent natural guard dogs. On the other hand, they typically take their cue from their handlers when it comes to greeting strangers, and are neither sharp nor shy. They do best when raised within the family but they can sleep outside, the better to act as guards (their weatherproof coats make them ideal kennel users even in the coldest winters). They are eager learners and can be trained to a high level. However, their physical and mental development is slow, relative to other similar breeds (e.g. German and other large shepherds): they are not mentally or physically mature until the age of about three years, so their training should not be rushed. Several five- or ten-minute play-training exercises per day in the early years can achieve better results than long or rigorous training sessions.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nBeaucerons can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Beaucerons exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials. They are excellent search and rescue dogs.\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nThere is a Beauceron named Bosco in the film Marmaduke.\nA dog of the same breed is also in the film Hotel for Dogs. His name is Henry.\nA pack of hunting Beaucerons appeared in the 1988 movie The Bear.\nA Beauceron was also seen in the film The Wild Child.\nTwo Beauce Shepherds appear in the James Bond movie Moonraker.\nThere was a Beauceron used extensively in the search and rescue efforts in the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City on September 11, 2001.\nThere was a Beauceron in a brief scene in the Martin Scorsese directed film Gangs of New York.\nThere was a Beacuron guard dog in the  Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet film The City of Lost Children\nThere was a Beauceron dog in a Soviet embassy scene in the 1990 Luc Besson film Nikita\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nVous et votre beauceron (French), written by Pierre Boistel, published by Editions de l'Homme, January 8, 1991, ISBN 2-7619-0900-3, 166 pages\nLes Berger Francais (French), written by Philippe De Wailly and Alain Dupont, published by Solar, September 12, 1999, ISBN 2-263-02658-4\nBeauceron, written by Meg Purnell Carpenter, published by Kennel Club Books, May, 2007, ISBN 978-1-59378-371-6, 160 pages\nLe Beauceron (French), written by Monique Reverdy, published by Art\u00e9mis, May 21, 2003, ISBN 2-84416-181-2, 144 pages\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in French) Club des Amis du Beauceron\nAmerican Beauceron Club\nBeauceron Club of Belgium\nAbout Beaucerons \nBeauceron Club UK\nBeauceron from Poland\nBeauceron Details"}, {"id": 59, "name": "Bedlington Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog59", "description": "The Bedlington Terrier is a breed of small dog named after the mining town of Bedlington, Northumberland in North East England.  Originally bred to hunt vermin the Bedlington Terrier has since been used in dog racing, numerous dog sports, as well as in conformation shows and as a companion dog. It is closely related to the Dandie Dinmont Terrier, Whippet and Otterhound.\nIt is described as a very versatile yet contradictory dog, being both good with children and \"fit to kill any other dog of his weight\". They have powerful swimming skills, comparable to those of water dogs such as the Newfoundland, and are noted for being very quick and having high endurance. Bedlingtons are noted for their similarity in appearance to lambs. The dogs have blue, liver or sandy colouration, all three of which may have tan points. Their fur forms a distinctive top knot on the dog's head. It is nonshedding and with minimal odor but needs weekly grooming to remove dead hair.Originally known as the Rothbury or Rodbury Terrier, the name Bedlington Terrier was not applied to the breed until 1825, but some dogs have pedigrees that can be traced back as far as 1782. The first dog show with a class for Bedlington Terriers was held in 1870 at Bedlington. Bedlington Terriers shown at early shows were frequently dyed to improve the look of their fur. In 1948, a Bedlington Terrier known as Rock Ridge Night Rocket won best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. The breed has a high incidence of copper toxicosis, but with the exception of eye problems, it is mostly free from health complaints.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Bedlington Terrier has been described as resembling a lamb. It has also been compared to a miniature version of the Scottish Deerhound. George Shields stated that exceedingly well-bred dogs possess the spirit of a thoroughbred racehorse.The dogs have blue, liver or sandy colouration, all three of which may have tan points. Bedlingtons carry what is known as the greying gene, a dominant trait carried on the G locus. This gene causes puppies born with black or dark brown fur to lighten to grey or liver with age. The fur of the Bedlington creates a shape on the top of the dog's head known as a topknot. Although most modern breed standards call for the dog's topknot to be lighter than its body, when the breed was first being formed there was at least one prominent breeder, Mr. Pickett, who believed that the topknot should be darker, not lighter.The dog's coat has been described as shaggy, hard, and rugged in style and it has also been described as linty in texture, giving the breed the nickname of \"linty-haired terrier\". Its coat is made up of a combination of hard and soft hairs. It is extremely difficult to maintain a \"show clip\", even for professionals, and grooming can be quite expensive.  Dogs in what is referred to as show clip, or groomed for the show ring, cannot have fur that stands out more than 1 inch (2.5 centimetres) from their body, and the coat must have a \"crisp\" texture. If grooming is not performed regularly, the coat's condition rapidly deteriorates. For that reason, most Bedlingtons that are kept strictly as pets keep a lower maintenance \"pet groom\" style. Bedlington Terriers \u2014like Poodles\u2014 have been referred to as a nonshedding, hypoallergenic breed. They have minimal dog odor as long as their coat and ears are healthy and their coat is groomed regularly to remove dead hair.The head of the dog must be rounded in shape with no stop. Their eyes are almond-shaped and small, and the lips are close-fitting and lack flews. The back must be arched, and the body should be slightly longer in length than in height. Although 16.5 inches (42 cm) is the preferred height for male dogs, a range from 16 to 17.5 inches (41 to 44 cm) is allowed; for females, the preferred height is 15.5 inches (39 cm) and the acceptable range is from 15 to 16.5 inches (38 to 42 cm). Both genders must weigh between 17 and 23 pounds (7.7 and 10.4 kg). They possess a light, springy gait.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nBedlingtons are sharp and plucky. Their bark has been called hound-like and has been compared to the firing of a machine gun. A fast dog with high endurance, the Bedlington Terrier is just as quick in water as it is on land, and their swimming speed rivals that of the Newfoundland. Bedlington Terriers \"have pace enough to keep up with the ordinary speed of a horse.\" Because of the Whippet in their lineage, they have a tendency to bolt. Their versatility has been praised, with some dogs willing to \"[be] a house-dog, a gun-dog, a rat-dog, a badger-dog, or, if needed, [to] bolt a fox...\"They are also known for their intelligence and tenacity when it comes to taking on vermin. Bedlingtons are quite fond of fighting, and are prone to jealousy when around other dogs. One man stated that \"this dog was about fit to kill any other dog of his weight\" and compared him to the fighting dogs used in dog fighting. They have also been used in pit fighting.\n\nHowever, both the AKC and the ASPCA call the breed \"mild\" and \"gentle\" and recommends it as being good with children. PetFinder says the breed is soft in temperament, companionable, demonstrative, loyal, and a quiet housedog. Although the breed may chase small animals outside, it is accepting of them inside. Playful and cheerful, the breed can be high-strung and excitable, and is prone to being headstrong. The New Zealand Kennel Club warns against keeping them with dogs that have dominant personalities, \"as once challenged they are terrifying fighters, despite their gentle appearance\", but otherwise the breed is good with other dogs.\nSome breeders, notably George Newcombe, have argued that the working ability and courage of the Bedlington terrier has declined since it began being bred for show. Poodle may have been introduced into the breed to make the coat easier to groom and maintain. George Newcombe of the Working Bedlington Terrier Club said that \"the pure [Bedlington Terrier] could no longer be considered a serious working breed\" and proceeded to cross his dogs with Lakeland Terriers in an attempt to bring back the Bedlington's working qualities.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBred in the village of Bedlington in Northumberland, the Bedlington Terrier has been described as \"the favourite companion of the northern miners\". They were originally known as Rodbury Terriers, Rothbury Terriers, or \"Rothbury's Lambs\", because the Lord of Rothbury had taken a particular liking to the dogs. Before this, they were known as \"gypsy dogs\", as the Romani people\u2014often referred to using the derogatory name 'Gypsies'\u2014and poachers used them to hunt. The first mention of the Bedlington terrier, or as it was then known, the Rothbury or Rodbury Terrier, was in 1825, most likely in The Life of James Allen, but some dogs' pedigrees have been traced as far back as 1782. James' father, William, was much in demand as an otter hunter, and he kept Bedlington Terriers in order to help him hunt. They were also valued by their owners as rabbit coursing dogs and racing dogs, until the Whippet became more popular as a racing dog and a courser.The Bedlington Terrier name was first given to a dog named Young Piper, which was owned by a man named Joseph Ainsley. Ainsley's Piper has been called \"the best of his race\" and \"had a reputation for great pluck and courage\". Piper began working with badgers at eight months old, and carried on hunting other animals generally regarded as vermin until he was blind. Piper is also known for saving a child from a pig, keeping the animal at bay until help arrived. Piper died at fifteen.The first shows that had a class for the Bedlington Terrier were held in 1870 at Bedlington. The following year, there was a Bedlington Terrier class at a show held at Crystal Palace, where a red dog named Miner took first prize. Miner also won a show held at Birmingham. The Bedlington Terrier Club was established in 1875. Many dogs in early shows were clipped and dyed to bring them closer to the breed standard and improve their chances of winning.\n\nIt is unknown if the judges of the time were aware of this practice, or if they cared. The practice of trimming was eventually accepted by The Kennel Club, under the pretense that the trimming was being done to \"smarten a dog to show his shape and general contour.\"Bedlington Terriers are closely related to the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. In fact, the Earl of Antrim once exhibited two terriers from the same litter, and one won shows as a Dandie Dinmont, while the other won shows as a Bedlington. Bedlington Terriers are also related to the Kerry Blue Terrier and the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier. The shape of its back suggests that it may related to the Whippet and it may also be related to the otterhound. Bedlington Terriers have been crossed with Whippets to produce a Lurcher with \"extra guts, pep, [and] fire.\"In 1948, Ch. Rock Ridge Night Rocket took best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show and was subsequently featured in LIFE magazine. One of his descendants,  Ch. Femars' Cable Car, was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated in the February 8, 1960 edition.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n=== Longevity ===\nMedian longevity of Bedlington Terriers, based on  two recent UK surveys, is about 13.5 years, which is longer than for purebred dogs in general and longer than most breeds similar in size.  The longest-lived of 48 deceased dogs in a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey was 18.4 years.  Leading causes of death among Bedlington Terriers in the UK were old age (23%), urologic (15%), and hepatic (12.5%). The leading \"hepatic\" cause of death was copper toxicosis. Dogs that died of liver diseases usually died at a younger age than dogs dying of most other causes.Bedlington Terrier owners in the UK reported that the most common health issues among living dogs were reproductive, heart murmur, and eye problems such as epiphora, retinal dysplasia, and cataracts. Bedlingtons seem to be more prone to these eye diseases than other breeds. They also have a high incidence of kidney problems. Copper toxicosis occurred among about 5% of living dogs. Inbreeding is a concern, as some dogs \"[having] been bred in and in to a damaging extent.\"  Reputable breeders will conduct DNA testing of all litters and will not allow pups who carry the copper toxicosis gene to be bred, a practice which has significantly reduced the incidence of this disease in the breed. Excepting these problems, Bedlingtons are generally a very healthy breed.\n\n\n=== Copper toxicosis ===\n\nCopper toxicosis, also known as copper storage disease and copper overload syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by an accumulation of copper in the liver. It is closely related to Wilson's disease in humans. Bedlington Terriers are more prone to copper toxicosis than most other dog breeds. West Highland White Terriers, Skye Terriers, and Doberman Pinschers are also prone to copper storage disease. Bedlington Terriers are the only breed of dog in which haemolysis has been reported, but there have been no reports of neurological involvement in any dog breed. Studies have shown that in Bedlingtons, the disease is caused by a defective metallothionein that causes cell lysosomes to become saturated with copper. This causes the cell to store copper in the nucleus. There are three varieties of the disease: the asymptomatic form occurs when copper accumulates but there are no clinical symptoms of the disorder; the fulminating form which is seen mostly in young dogs, causes death in two to three days, and is thought to be caused by stress; and the chronic form, which is characterized by an extended period of time in which liver disease slowly causes the death of the dog. Bedlingtons also have a tendency to accumulate iron in the liver, but not nearly to the extent that they accumulate copper.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBedlington Terrier at Curlie"}, {"id": 60, "name": "Belgian Shepherd Dog (Groenendael)", "country": "Belgium", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog60", "description": "The Groenendael (in English, approximately ) is a variety of dog that is included in the Belgian Shepherd breed, but sometimes treated as a distinct breed. The Groenendael is recognized, either as a breed or a variety of the larger breed, by all major kennel clubs, such as the Kennel Club of the UK. In the American Kennel Club, it is called the Belgian Sheepdog, a term otherwise synonymous with Belgian Shepherd Dog more broadly.\n\n\n== Description ==\nLike all Belgian Shepherds, the Groenendael is a medium-sized, hard-working, square-proportioned dog, in the sheepdog family. The Groenendael is recognized by its distinctive black coat.\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Groenendael should be athletic, strong, imposing, rustic, and balanced in appearance. It should look natural, never as though it has been prepared just for the show ring. Its coat should be profuse, but never look as though it would inhibit the dog's working ability in any way. The colour is always black, with sometimes small white markings being allowed on the chest,chin and feet. Floppy ears are considered a fault when showing. When being shown, its handler should never have to force it into position; ideally the handler should not have to touch the dog at all.\n\n\n==== Size ====\nThe Groenendael should be 60\u201366 centimetres (24\u201326 in) at the withers for males, and 56\u201362 centimetres (22\u201324 in) for females. The weight should be approximately 25\u201330 kilograms (55\u201366 lb) for males, and 20\u201325 kilograms (44\u201355 lb) for females.\n\n\n==== Coat ====\nThe Groenendael has a thick, double coat. The texture should be hard and dense, never woolly, silky, frizzy, fine, or wiry. The undercoat should be thick and profuse. In conformation shows, dogs without an undercoat are heavily penalized.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe Groenendael is intelligent, active, loyal and quietly affectionate. Groenendaels are not a breed for the faint of heart. However, for those who have plenty of time, energy, confidence and love, they are wonderful friends. Training and socializing is essential. They are wary of strangers and protective. They love children as long as they are introduced to them at an early age. The Groenendael bonds deeply to its people and cannot live outdoors or in a kennel. It needs to spend time with its family every day and may experience separation anxiety if left alone for long periods of time.\n\n\n== Care ==\nThe Groenendael needs a large amount of exercise as a rule. Expect to spend about two hours a day working with it. Exercise should include not only a walk, but also a training session to keep the dog mentally stimulated. These dogs have great \"work ethic\" and need a job to do, such as obedience, flyball, schutzhund training, dog agility or livestock work in order to be happy. They are a sensitive breed and cannot be trained using harsh training methods. They do not need much grooming, however when shedding (which happens once or twice a year) they lose massive amounts of coat and need grooming every day.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n== Activities ==\nBelgian Shepherds can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at non-competitive herding tests. Groenendael exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials. One of the basic activities of the Belgian Shepherd was guarding the flock. This make that the Belgian shepherd is extremely useful for protection purposes. The Malinois is famous for its IPO or Police-dog performance, but the Groenendael can also be used for this purpose.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLaekenois\nMalinois\nTervuren\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGroenendael dog at Curlie"}, {"id": 61, "name": "Belgian Shepherd Dog (Laekenois)", "country": "Belgium", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog61", "description": "The Laekenois is a breed of dog, sometimes classified as a variety of the Belgian Shepherd rather than as a separate breed. \"Laekenois\" is pronounced  LAK-in-wah. This breed is not fully recognized in the United States.  However, they can be shown in Britain, Canada, Australia, and throughout Europe, along with all three of the closely related breeds which share a heritage with the Laekenois:  the Tervuren, the Malinois, and the Groenendael, the last being shown in the U.S. as the Belgian Sheepdog.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nLike all Belgian Shepherds, the Laekenois is a medium-sized, hard-working, square-proportioned dog in the sheepdog family with sharply triangular ears. The Laekenois is recognized by its woolly brown and white coat, intermixed so as to give a tweedy appearance. Most kennel clubs' standards allow for black shading, principally in muzzle and tail, indicating the presence of the melanistic mask gene.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Belgian Laekenois originated as a dog for herding sheep at the Royal Castle of Laeken. Besides its role as a herding dog, this breed is also used to guard linen that is placed in fields to dry. In the First and Second World War, the Laekenois was used a messenger dog .The Laekenois is considered both the oldest and the most rare of the Belgian Shepherd Dogs. Until the advent of dog shows in the early 1900s, the four varieties were freely intermixed, in fact, there are only three genes (short/long coat, smooth/wire coat, fawn/black coat) that separate the varieties genetically. Purebred Laekenois occasionally give birth to smooth-coated puppies, which, depending on the pure-bred registry, can be registered as Malinois.The Laekenois is currently in the American Kennel Club's Miscellaneous Class and is assigned the Herding Group.\n\n\n== Health ==\nSee Health section of Belgian Shepherd for more information.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nLaekenois can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events.

The name \"Malinois\" is derived from Malines, the French name for the breed's Flemish city of origin, Mechelen.The breed is used as a working dog for tasks including detection of odors such as explosives, accelerants (for arson investigation), and narcotics; tracking humans for suspect apprehension in police work; and search and rescue missions. The U.S. Secret Service uses Belgian Malinois to guard the grounds of the White House.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Malinois is a medium-to-large and square-proportioned dog in the sheepdog family. The Malinois has a short mahogany coat with black markings. It has black erect ears and a black muzzle. It has a square build in comparison to the German Shepherd.\n\n\n=== Coat and color ===\nDue to its history as a working dog (i.e., being bred for function over form), the Malinois can vary greatly in appearance. The acceptable colors of pure-bred Malinois are a base color fawn to mahogany and tan with a black mask and black ears with some degree of black tipping on the hairs, giving an overlay appearance. The color tends to be lighter with less black agouti or overlay on the dog's underside, breeching, and inner leg. White markings are also allowed on the tips of the toes and the chest. A Belgian malinois may have a longer and darker hair coat than the typical malinois, but may still be referred to as a Belgian malinois.\n\nThe other varieties of Belgian Shepherd are distinguished by their coats and colors: the Tervuren is the same color as the Malinois but has long hair, the wire-coated Laekenois is fawn and lacks the black mask and ears, and the Groenendael (registered as Belgian Sheepdog by the American Kennel Club) has long hair and is solid black. When the Malinois was first bred, the four breeds would usually be cross bred, this would result in Malinois with longer hair, or even a darker coat. Today the four breeds are considered different breeds.\n\n\n=== Size ===\nMales are about 61\u201366 cm (24\u201326 in), while females are about 56\u201361 cm (22\u201324 in) at the withers. Female Malinois average 20\u201325 kg (44\u201355 lb); males are heavier at 25\u201330 kg (55\u201366 lb).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nWell-raised and trained Malinois are usually active, intelligent, friendly, protective, alert and hard-working. Belgian Malinois exhibit energy levels that are among the highest of all dog breeds. A typical Malinois will have puppy-like energy until the age of three, though it is not uncommon for them to exhibit this energy level until the age of five. Many have excessively high prey drive. Some may be excessively exuberant or playful, especially when young.They can be destructive or develop neurotic behaviors if not provided enough stimulation and exercise. This often causes problems for owners who are unfamiliar with the breed and are not prepared to provide the exercise they require or a job for them to do. They are medium-sized, strong dogs that require consistent obedience training, and enjoy being challenged with new tasks. They are known to be very easy to train, due to their high drive for rewards.\n\n\n== Working dog ==\n\nIn Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and other European countries, as well as in the United States, Canada, Australia and Hong Kong, the Malinois is bred primarily as a working dog for personal protection, detection, police work, search and rescue, and sport work like Schutzhund. The United States Secret Service and Royal Australian Air Force use the breed along with other working lines such as Dutch Shepherd, and also GSD. In the United States Armed Forces, German shepherds lead the way, but close behind follows the Belgian Malinois.In India, the ITBP and National Security Guard (NSG) commando unit have inducted Malinois breed into its K-9 unit.Malinois dogs are used by the Oketz, the K-9 unit of the Israel Defense Forces. Malinois are a suitable size to be picked up by their handlers when required, while still being large enough to control human aggressors. Compared to previously used breeds (such as German Shepherds and Rottweilers), the shorter coats and fair and neutral colors of Malinois are better adapted to natural conditions and less prone to induce heatstroke.United States Navy SEALs used a Belgian Malinois war dog named Cairo in Operation Neptune Spear, in which Osama bin Laden was killed.Belgian Malinois have also been called a \"game changer\" in the fight against rhino poaching in South Africa's Kruger National Park, where one dog, K9 Killer, has been responsible for more than 100 arrests.\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\nMalinois can compete in dog agility trials and in flyball, herding, obedience, showmanship, and tracking events, and are one of the most popular breeds used in protection sports such as the Schutzhund. In America, herding is a popular activity.\nHerding instincts can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests.  In 2011 alone, the AKC awarded 39 new herding titles to Belgian Malinois.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe average lifespan of the Belgian Malinois is 10\u201312 years.  Notable health problems prevalent to the Malinois include cataracts, epilepsy, thyroid disease, progressive retinal atrophy, hip dysplasia, and pannus, although these problems have been minimized through selective breeding.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nKane, the co-star of James Rollins and Grant Blackwood's Tucker Wayne series, is a Belgian Malinois.\nBillie, the four-year-old black Belgian Malinois partner of Detective Reed Mattox in the \"Reed and Billie\" series by Dustin Stevens.\n\n\n=== Television ===\nThe American science fiction crime drama television series Person of Interest features a Malinois named Bear as a regular cast member.\nThe military drama SEAL Team includes a Malinois named Dita the Hairmissile who plays 'Cerberus the detection dog'.\nDaryl Dixon's companion Dog is a Malinois from Season 9 onwards of The Walking Dead.\n\n\n=== Film ===\nThe titular character of the 2015 feature film Max is a Malinois, returning from service with the US Marine Corps\nIt was also used in Naaigal Jaakirathai (English: Beware of Dogs), a Tamil-language Indian film\nThree different Malinois played the role of \"Tracker\", the faithful but vicious companion of Sam, the merciless rifle-toting vigilante of Mexican film Desierto\n\n\n== Notable dogs ==\n\n\n=== Dickin Medal recipients ===\nAwarded the Dickin Medal for conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving in military conflict\n\nDiesel\nMali\nKuga\n\n\n=== PDSA Gold medal recipients ===\nAwarded the PDSA Gold Medal for animal bravery:\n\nK9 Killer\n\n\n== See also ==\nSchipperke\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHartnagle-Taylor, Jeanne Joy; Taylor, Ty (2010).

Its classification varies, being classified under some breed standards as a breed in its own right, and in others as one of several acceptable variations of the Belgian Shepherd Dog. It is usually listed within breed standards under one or other, or a combination, of these names.\nIn the United States, since 1959, the AKC recognizes it under the name Belgian Tervuren. Prior to 1959, the Belgium Tervuren was shown as Belgium Sheepdog. In that year, the AKC granted the breed separate status.\nIn Canada, the Canadian Kennel Club recognizes the Tervuren as a variety of the Belgian Shepherd (prior to 2005, Belgian Shepherd Dogs were called Belgian Sheepdogs).\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Tervuren is a medium-sized, square-proportioned dog in the Herding dog group. Males stand between 24 and 26 inches, and weigh approximately 56 lb. Females are finer and smaller. It is recognized by its thick double coat, generally mahogany  with varying degrees of black overlay (completely missing overlay on males is a serious fault), including a black mask.  A small patch of white on the chest is permissible, as well as white tips on toes. The Tervuren may also be sable or grey, but this may be penalized in the show ring in some countries according to the standard of the registering body. While the FCI permits any type of red (mahogany) coat including pale yellow (sand colour) and grey the AKC has stricter rules regarding colour. While the FCI states that fawn/mahogany is to be preferred, grey colour is a fault under AKC rules.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nTervurens are highly energetic, intelligent dogs who require a job to keep them occupied. This can be herding, obedience, agility, flyball, tracking, or protection work. They are also found working as Search and Rescue (SAR) dogs, finding missing people and avalanche victims.  Tervurens that are not kept sufficiently busy can become hyperactive or destructive.\nAs companion animals, Tervurens are loyal and form strong bonds with their family, leading some to be shy around strangers. They are good watch dogs, being very observant and attentive to the slightest change in their environment. Some can be nervous, depending on breeding and early experiences, so care must be taken to adequately socialize Tervuren puppies to a wide variety of people and situations. \nTervurens are not generally recommended to first-time dog owners due to their high maintenance level.\nTheir appearance projects alertness and elegance. The breed is known for its loyalty and versatility. Those who own them report being charmed by their intelligence, and trainability.  \n\n\n== Activities ==\nTervuren can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, Schutzhund, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Belgian Shepherds exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.Tervuren are frequently in Schuzhund training as they are seen as a higher level protection dog to stylish or affluent owners and can be brought on most forms of travel without the panic problems that other breeds have.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nGenerally healthy, but Tervurens can have a susceptibility to hip dysplasia, epilepsy, gastric problems (including bloats and torsions) and some eye and skin problems.\n\n\n== Grooming ==\nThe Tervuren has a thick, double coat similar to the Groenendael. Regular brushing is necessary to remove loose undercoat, but in general, the fur is not prone to matting but occasionally, they can get hairballs. A properly textured Tervuren coat is slightly hard, laying flat against the body (unlike, for instance, the Samoyed's off-standing fur). It naturally sheds dirt and debris, but burrs and seeds may stick to the feathering on the legs.\nThe Tervuren is shown in a natural state, with minimal trimming and cosmetic products. Bathing, brushing, and trimming the fur on the feet with scissors to emphasize their tight, cat-footed shape is the extent of most exhibitors' grooming routines. Products that alter the coloration of the coat and masking are not allowed in the ring.\n\n\n== Faults (AKC) ==\n\nPadding, hackneying, weaving, crabbing and similar movement faults are to be penalized according to the degree with which they interfere with the ability of the dog to work.In his relationship with humans he is observant and vigilant with strangers, but not apprehensive. He does not show fear or shyness. He does not show viciousness by unwarranted or unprovoked attack. He must be approachable, standing his ground and showing confidence to meet overtures without himself making them. With those he knows well, he is most affectionate and friendly, zealous for their attention and very possessive.\n\n\n== Famous Tervuren ==\nIn an episode of Hogan's Heroes, Belgian Shepherds were referred to as the preferred choice of police dogs.\nFor the film The Company of Wolves the wolves are primarily played by dyed Tervurens.\nWellard from EastEnders.\nA Tervuren is featured in Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London as a test subject for a mind-control device.\nA Tervuren is also featured in Friday Night Dinner as neighbour Jim's dog, Wilson\nA Belgian Malinois is featured in Inspector Lewis Season 1 Episode Sons of the Twice Born\nA Tervuren named Mr. Cupcake can be seen on Alaskan Bush People, he's the family's dog.\nFEMA Search-and-Rescue Tervuren Snowflower Maine Topper was one of the first to respond to the Oklahoma City bombing, also participated in 9/11 SAR efforts.  .\n\n\n== See also ==\nBelgian Shepherd\nBelgian Shepherd Dog (Groenendael)\nBelgian Shepherd Dog (Laekenois)\nBelgian Shepherd Dog (Malinois)\nSchipperke\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTervuren dog at Curlie"}, {"id": 64, "name": "Bergamasco Shepherd", "country": "Italy", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog64", "description": "The Bergamasco Shepherd (Italian pastore bergamasco) is a breed of dog with its origins in the Italian Alps near Bergamo, where it was originally used as a herding dog.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nIn 2018, a genetic study found that just prior to 1859 a broadly distributed European herding dog had given rise to the German Shepherd, the French Berger Picard, and the five Italian herding breeds: Bergamasco Shepherd, Cane Paratore, Lupino del Gigante, Pastore d'Oropa, and the it:Cane da pastore della Lessinia e del Lagorai.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe  Bergamasco is a muscular, heavy-boned herding dog with a large head and a thick tail that hangs down to the hock and curves slightly upward at the end. The entire dog is covered with an abundant coat that forms mats. The Bergamasco is compact in profile but is just slightly longer than tall. The Bergamasco\u2019s characteristic feature is its unique coat, made up of three types of hair. The coat forms flocks (strands of hair weaved together creating flat layers of felted hair) or loose mats, which cover the dog's body and legs, and protect the dog from weather and predators. The hair on the head is typically long and hangs over the eyes.Dogs stand 23\u00bd inches and bitches 22 inches, measured at the withers. One inch taller or shorter than the ideal is acceptable. Males weigh between 70 and 84 pounds. Females weigh between 57 and 71 pounds. The Bergamasco is a muscular, heavy-boned herding dog with plenty of substance. The Bergamasco is very slightly longer than tall, with the length of body measured from point of shoulder to point of buttocks about 5 to 6 percent longer than the height measured at the withers.\n\n\n== Coat and colour ==\nThe breed's most distinctive feature is the unusual felted coat, a normal and healthy characteristic of the breed. The coat is characterized by three types of hair: a fine, dense, oily undercoat, long harsher hairs similar to a goat's and a top woolly outer-coat. The three types of hair weave together as the dog gets older to form flat mats or flocks. The mats start from the spine and go down the flanks, growing every year to reach the ground. The color can be solid gray or gradations of gray (including merle) up to and including solid black, provided it is not shiny or lustrous. Color also includes shadings  only of isabella and fawn at the lower part of flocks (as a result of discoloration of old hair, not as a base color).The Eastern European breeds, the Komondor and Mioritic Shepherd, have a single coat consisting of relatively little guard hair (also referred to as \"goat hair\"), but mainly curly down hair as an adaptation to that environment. The Western European breeds, such as the Briard and the Spanish Water Dog, also have a single coat, however, it consists mainly of guard hair. The Alpine region geographically between them, home of the Bergamasco shepherd, appears to form a bridge between these two groups. The Bergamasco shepherd forms flocks which consist of both types of hair are present in almost equal proportions, although straighter and differently distributed.The Bergamasco's coat is considered to be non-shedding. The Bergamasco shepherd's coat does not cord (cording is the twisting of hairs together to create a spiral strand), like the Komondor. The Bergamasco coat is very different, in that the strands of hair weave together creating flat layers of hair (called flocks). A flock is a tuft or lock of wool or hair. Each flock of hair ranges in width anywhere from 1\u00bd to 3 inches wide.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Bergamasco is an alert, observant and patient dog breed with good self-control and balance. This breed is suited even as a guard and companion dog. The Bergamasco establishes close bond with his owner. Aggressive or overly shy behavior is a fault.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThis breed can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, and tracking events. Herding instincts and trainability mean the dog can be trained to compete in herding trials. Although the Bergamasco is often photographed herding sheep, it is traditionally a cattle dog that performs well in a mountain environment. The cattlemen let their dogs go and they bring the herd back without human supervision.\n\n\n== Health ==\nHealth information for this breed is sparse.  The only health survey appears to be a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, which had a sample size of 0 deceased dogs and 10 living dogs, far too few dogs from which to draw any conclusions.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKomondor\nPuli\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBergamasco Sheepdog Club of America\nBergamasco Sheepdog Association of Canada\nInternational Bergamasco Sheepdog Association"}, {"id": 65, "name": "Berger Blanc Suisse", "country": "Switzerland", "type": "", "picture": "dog65", "description": "The Berger Blanc Suisse (English: White Swiss Shepherd, German: Weisser Schweizer Sch\u00e4ferhund, Italian: Pastore Svizzero Bianco) is a breed of dog from Switzerland. It is of the same origins as the White Shepherd and the German Shepherd Dog, and has been recognized as a separate breed by the FCI.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first German Shepherd Dog registered by the Society for German Shepherd Dogs (Verein f\u00fcr deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde) was Horand Von Grafrath. Neither he nor any of his documented progeny were white, although his great-grand sire on his mother's side was white.At the creation of the German Shepherd Dog breed, all colours were accepted. It was in the first decades of the 20th century that the white exemplars began to be excluded in Europe.\nThe first White Shepherd club was founded during the 1970s in America. Meanwhile, the breed appeared again in Europe, at first in Switzerland, then Denmark and Germany came next. Slowly, the European cynological societies began to open their stud books to the White Shepherd.\nThe white-coated dog Lobo, born in the U.S. in 1966, was registered in Switzerland. The Berger Blanc (English: White Shepherd) breed was recognized in Switzerland 1991 and in the Netherlands in 1992. The Czech Republic, Austria and Denmark also recognized the breed.\nThe breed was officially recognized by the FCI in 2011. The KC officially recognized the breed in 2017.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nMost Berger Blanc Suisse dogs are gentle, very intelligent and learn easily. They are loyal to their family and may be wary of strangers, but are not prone to showing shy or fearful behavior. Some people think the Arctic wolf was mixed with the breed to create its caution, however this is not true. The Berger Blanc Suisse breed derived from decades of evolution to a distinct breed type from the German Shepherd Dog. The Berger Blanc Suisse are suited for a variety of services to man from search and rescue to medical alert to therapy. They are also structured and have temperaments to succeed at performance events such as obedience, rally, agility, lure coursing, barn hunt (ratting), protection sports, dock diving, fly ball, truffling, and other scent/tracking oriented training. They are natural herders, can cart, and are very well suited as an all around utility farm dog.\nThe character of the Berger Blanc Suisse is gentler and mellower than that of the working lines of German Shepherd Dog, but are still very protective of their people and dog pack.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nBerger Blanc Suisse can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, frisbee,  tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Berger Blanc Suisse exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArgentine Club Berger Blanc Suisse Shepherd\nFBBSI (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Berger Blanc Suisse Internationale)History of the Berger Blanc Suisse"}, {"id": 66, "name": "Berger Picard", "country": "France", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog66", "description": "The Berger Picard ( /b\u025br\u02c8\u0292e\u026a p\u026a\u02c8kar/) or Picardy Shepherd is a French herding originating in Picardy. These dogs nearly became extinct after both World War I and World War II and remain a rare breed. \n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Berger Picard is a medium-sized, well-muscled dog, slightly longer than tall with a tousled yet elegant appearance. Their ears are naturally erect, high-set and quite wide at the base. Their eyebrows are thick, but do not shield their dark frank eyes. They are known for their smile. Their natural tail normally reaches to the hock and is carried with a slight J-curve at the tip. Their weather-proof coat is harsh and crisp to the touch, not excessively long with a minimal undercoat. Coat colors fall into two colors, fawn and brindle with a range of shade variations.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Berger Picard's attributes include a lively, intelligent personality and a sensitive and assertive disposition that responds quickly to obedience training. By and large, Picards are laid back and mellow but can be reserved towards strangers. They require a lot of socialization during the first two years of their lives.\nPicards are energetic and hard working, alert and are not excessive barkers. Some Picards are notoriously picky eaters.\nThe breed also has a well-developed sense of humor, making them an endearing companion, and they continue to be used very effectively as both sheep and cattle herder in their native land and elsewhere.Like many herding breeds, Picards require human companionship and lots of it. Since they can be demonstrative to their owners and enthusiastic friends towards other animals, formal obedience training and plenty of positive socialization is a must.\n\n\n== Health ==\nBerger Picards are a relatively healthy breed. Known medical conditions include Hip dysplasia and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA). A reputable breeder will have hips certified by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) or by PennHip with the results posted at the OFA database. Eyes will be certified for hereditary diseases through the OFA as well (previously through the Canine Eye Research Foundation) and results should also be published on the OFA database.\nThe Berger Picard also participates in the Canine Health Information Center. To obtain a CHIC number, dogs must have their hips and eyes checked with the results published on the OFA website and their blood banked for DNA plus one elective, either elbows, thyroid or heart evaluated.\nThe breed's life expectancy is 12 to 14 years.\n\n\n== Care ==\n\n\n=== Exercise and activities ===\nThe Berger Picard can compete in agility trials, Tracking, obedience, showmanship, Schutzhund, Flyball, Lure coursing, French Ring Sport and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Berger Picards exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n=== Living conditions ===\nDespite being able and ready to work outdoors, Picards can do surprisingly well in city life provided they are given enough energy-releasing exercise. They are very loyal and enjoy a lot of attention and may suffer from separation anxiety (even if being left alone inside for short periods of time).  This is not a breed created to live outside year round. They lack the layer of body fat that even a lean Livestock Guardian Dog has and their coat is not dense enough to withstand fridge winter conditions of many areas.\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\nThe Berger Picard is a low maintenance dog. The rough, tousled coat can mat if not brushed on a regular basis (once every other week) but the coat does not require special care to yield its rustic appearance. Bathing is rarely done. Their fur should never be trimmed except possibly hand-stripping the ears. Picards have low oil content in their fur and therefore have little \"doggie odor\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 2018, a genetic study found that just prior to 1859 a broadly distributed European herding dog had given rise to the German Shepherd, the French Berger Picard, and the five Italian herding breeds: Bergamasco Shepherd, Cane Paratore, Lupino del Gigante, Pastore d'Oropa, and the it:Cane da pastore della Lessinia e del Lagorai.Thought to be the oldest of the French Sheepdogs, the Berger Picard was brought to northern France and the Pas de Calais, in the 9th century by the Franks.Some experts insist that this breed is related to the more well-known Briard and Beauceron, while others believe it shares a common origin with Dutch and Belgian Shepherds. Although the Berger Picard made an appearance at the first French dog show in 1863, the breed's rustic appearance did not lead to popularity as a show dog.The breeding stock of the Berger Picard, was decimated by the ravages of World War I and World War II. With its population concentrated on the farms of north-eastern France, trench warfare in the Somme reduced the breed to near extinction. The Berger Picard was accepted by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) in 1955.The Picard's easy care and mellow, yet mischievous, temperament have started the breed back on the road to recovery. Nevertheless, its numbers are still limited, even in its native country. As mentioned previously, today in France there are approximately 3500 dogs and in Germany approximately 500 of this breed. At present there are approximately 400 Berger Picards in the United States and Canada.\nIn 2006 the Berger Picard Club of America was formed to help promote and protect this breed. The Berger Picard was fully recognized in the herding group by the American Kennel Club as of 1 July 2015.The Berger Picard is a recognized breed by the Canadian Kennel Club.  It is in the Herding Group, Group 7.  The Standard for this breed is available through the Canadian Kennel Club, Group 7 breed standards. The national breed club is Berger Picard Club Canada.The interim breed standard for the Picardy Sheepdog was approved and the breed was accepted on to the import register of the United Kingdom's Kennel Club on the 1st April 2014. The breed can only be shown in Import classes at present and currently awaiting official registration of the breed club the Picardy Sheepdog club (proposed).  The Picard was first shown at Crufts in March 2016 in the Pastoral (Herding) Group.\n\n\n=== Recent History ===\nBerger Picards have been seen in at least three movies, Daniel and the Superdogs (2004); Because of Winn-Dixie (2005); and Are We Done Yet? (2007). The producers of the 2005 American movie Because of Winn-Dixie brought five Picards over from Europe (\"Scott\", \"Laiko\" and \"Tasha\" performed in the movie). The trainer wanted a dog that resembled the scruffy mutt on the original book's cover but needed several that looked alike so that production could continue smoothly, thus he decided on this rare purebred dog from France. People often mistakenly think \"Winn-Dixie\" is a mixed breed.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHerreros, Joel (1997). The Berger Picard (in French). De Vecchi.

The name Sennenhund is derived from the German Senne (\"alpine pasture\") and Hund (hound/dog), as they accompanied the alpine herders and dairymen called Senn. Berner (or Bernese in English) refers to the area of the breed\u2019s origin, in the canton of Bern. This mountain dog was originally kept as a general farm dog.  Large Sennenhunde in the past were also used as draft animals, pulling carts.  The breed was officially established in 1907.  In 1937, the American Kennel Club recognized it; today, the club classifies it as a member of the Working Group.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\n\n=== Four breeds of Sennenhund ===\nThe four breeds of Sennenhund, with the original breed name, followed by the most popular English version of the breed name:\n\nGrosser Schweizer Sennenhund, Greater Swiss mountain dog\nBerner Sennenhund, Bernese mountain dog\nAppenzeller Sennenhund, Appenzeller\nEntlebucher Sennenhund, Entlebucher mountain dog\n\n\n=== Colouring ===\nLike the other Sennenhunde, the Bernese mountain dog is a large, heavy dog with a distinctive tri-colored coat, black with white chest and rust colored markings above eyes, sides of mouth, front of legs, and a small amount around the white chest. The ideal of a perfectly marked individual gives the impression of a white horseshoe shape around the nose and a white \u201cSwiss cross\u201d on the chest, when viewed from the front. A \u201cSwiss kiss\u201d is a white mark located typically behind the neck, but may be a part of the neck. A full ring would not meet type standard. The AKC breed standard lists, as disqualifications, blue eye color, and any ground color other than black.\n\n\n=== Height and weight ranges ===\n25\u201327.5 in (64\u201370 cm) for males, while it is 23\u201326 in (58\u201366 cm) for females. Weight is 80\u2013120 lb (35\u201355 kg) for males, while it is 75\u2013100 lb (35\u201345 kg) for females.\n\n\n=== Build and proportions ===\nThe Bernese mountain dog is slightly longer than it is tall, and it is highly muscular.\n\n\n=== Other physical traits ===\nThe head of the Bernese mountain dog is flat on the top with a moderate stop, and the ears are medium-sized, triangular, set high, and rounded at the top. The teeth have a scissors bite. The legs of the Bernese are straight and strong, with round, arched toes. The dewclaws of the Bernese are often removed. Its bushy tail is carried low.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe breed standard for the Bernese mountain dog states that dogs should not be \"aggressive, anxious or distinctly shy\", but rather should be \"good-natured\", \"self-assured\", \"placid towards strangers\", and \"docile\". The temperament of individual dogs may vary, and not all examples of the breed have been bred carefully to follow the standard. All large breed dogs should be well socialized when they are puppies, and given regular training and activities throughout their lives.\nBernese are outdoor dogs at heart, though well-behaved in the house; they need activity and exercise, but do not have a great deal of endurance. They can move with amazing bursts of speed for their size when motivated. If they are sound (no problems with their hips, elbows, or other joints), they enjoy hiking and generally stick close to their people. Not being given the adequate amount of exercise may lead to barking and harassing in the Bernese.Bernese mountain dogs are a breed that generally does well with children, as they are very affectionate. They are patient dogs that take well to children climbing over them. Though they have great energy, a Bernese will also be happy with a calm evening.Bernese work well with other pets and around strangers.  They are excellent guardians.  They tend to bond with one owner, and are somewhat aloof and standoffish.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHistorically, in some locales at least, the breed was called a D\u00fcrrbachhund.The dogs have roots in the Roman Molosser breeds.The breed was used as an all purpose farm dog for guarding property and to drive dairy cattle long distances from the farm to the alpine pastures. The type was originally called the D\u00fcrrb\u00e4chler, for a small town (D\u00fcrrbach) where the large dogs were especially frequent.  In the early 1900s, fanciers exhibited the few examples of the large dogs at shows in Berne, and in 1907 a few breeders from the Burgdorf region founded the first breed club, the Schweizerische D\u00fcrrbach-Klub, and wrote the first Standard which defined the dogs as a separate breed. By 1910, there were already 107 registered members of the breed. There is a photo of a working Bernese Mountain Dog, dated 1905 at the Fumee Fall rest area in Quinnesec, MI.\nIn the US, the Bernese Mountain Dog is growing in popularity, ranking in 32nd place by the American Kennel Club in 2013.These dogs are very popular as family dogs in German-speaking countries, where they are among the most popular dog breeds (for example, the German Association of Dog Breeders listed the Bernese at the 11th rank per live births in 2014).\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n=== Medical problems ===\n\nCancer is the leading cause of death for dogs in general, but Bernese Mountain Dogs have a much higher rate of fatal cancer than other breeds; in both U.S./Canada and UK surveys, nearly half of Bernese Mountain Dogs die of cancer,\ncompared to about 27% of all dogs.  Bernese Mountain Dogs are killed by many types of cancer, including malignant histiocytosis, mast cell tumor, lymphosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and osteosarcoma. Inherited medical problems that a Bernese Mountain Dog may face include malignant histiocytosis, hypomyelinogenesis, progressive retinal atrophy, and possibly cataracts and hypoadrenocorticism. The breed is also prone to histiocytic sarcoma, a cancer of the muscle tissue that is very aggressive, and hereditary eye diseases that are common among larger dogs. A four-year-old Bernese with lymphoma named Dylan was one of the first dogs to receive chemotherapy at the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, and it was successful.Bernese Mountain Dogs have an unusually high mortality due to musculoskeletal causes. Arthritis, hip dysplasia, and cruciate ligament rupture were reported as the cause of death in 6% of Bernese Mountain Dogs in the UK study; for comparison, mortality due to musculoskeletal ailments was reported to be less than 2% for pure-bred dogs in general. Owners of Bernese Mountain Dogs are nearly three times as likely as owners of other breeds to report musculoskeletal problems in their dogs; the most commonly reported being cruciate ligament rupture, arthritis (especially in shoulders and elbows), hip dysplasia, and osteochondritis.  The age at onset for musculoskeletal problems is also unusually low. In the U.S./Canada study, 11% of living dogs had arthritis at an average age of 4.3 years.  Most other common, non-musculoskeletal morbidity issues strike Berners at rates similar to other breeds. Prospective Bernese Mountain Dog owners should be prepared to cope with a large dog that may have mobility problems at a young age. Options to help mobility-impaired dogs may include ramps for car or house access, lifting harnesses and slings, and dog wheelchairs (ex: Walkin` Wheels). Comfortable bedding may help alleviate joint pain. Due to these common medical issues, owners of Bernese Mountain Dogs should make sure that their dogs receive OFA and CERF certificates.\n\n\n=== Life expectancy ===\nThe Bernese is one of the short-lived dog breeds, compared both to other breeds of a similar size and to purebred dogs in general.  The average life expectancy of a Bernese Mountain Dog is approximately 7 to 8 years. Most other breeds of a similar size have median longevities of 10\u201311 years. In a 2004 UK survey, the longest-lived of 394 deceased Bernese Mountain Dogs died at the age of 15.2 years.\n\n\n== Care ==\n\n\n=== Activities ===\nThe Bernese's calm temperament makes them a natural for pulling small carts or wagons, a task they originally performed in Switzerland. With proper training they enjoy giving children rides in a cart or participating in a parade, such as the Conway, New Hampshire holiday parade. Regional Bernese clubs often offer carting workshops.  Carting competitions are held for the breed.On July 1, 2010, the Bernese Mountain Dog became eligible to compete in AKC Herding Events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Berners exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\n\nBernese Mountain Dogs shed year-round, and the heaviest shedding is during seasonal changes. Usually the Bernese will only require a brushing once a week, with more in spring and fall, to keep its coat neat and reduce the amount of fur on the floor and furniture.  The Bernese will only require a bath about once every couple of months or so, depending on how high its activity level is and how often it spends its time in the dirt.Special attention should be paid to the ears of the Bernese Mountain Dog, as they can trap bacteria, dirt, and liquid. The risk of an ear infection drops with weekly ear cleanings using a veterinarian-recommended cleanser.\n\n\n== Notable Bernese Mountain Dogs ==\n\nHercules is Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger's dog that he brought home from the Emmental region of Switzerland during a 2006 weeklong trip to discover his family's roots in the country.\nSasha was a Bernese Mountain Dog that followed a goat off of a cliff and managed to survive the fall as well as three days on an ice shelf waiting for rescue.\nThe characters Bryan (Andrew Rannells) and David (Justin Bartha) in the 2012 TV series The New Normal own two Bernese Mountain Dogs named \"Smelly\" and \"Harvey Milkbone\".\nOhly was a Bernese Mountain Dog who achieved notoriety in Canada after disappearing and then being found on Mount Seymour in a dangerous area known as \"Suicide Gulley.\" Members of North Shore Rescue, a local mountain rescue team, tracked, located and rescued Ohly.\nQuincey von Wiesmadern, has appeared in various videos with Hansi Hinterseer, an Austrian singer, entertainer and former member of the Austrian Ski Team.\nHannah is the real-life inspiration for the protagonist of children's books such as A Beach Day for Hannah and A Snow Day for Hannah by Linda Petrie Bunch.\nArgus and Fiona were two Bernese mountain dogs that were shot and killed when they entered a neighbor's yard. The neighbor who shot the dogs admits that he was overreacting.  A Pennsylvania state law states that humans are free to kill animals attacking domestic animals. The man feared a possible attack on his sheep, who were in their fenced off grazing area. Attacks on a neighbor's farm had taken place and resulted in the death of several animals sometime the previous year, although the type of dog who ruthlessly attacked those animals was not a Bernese. However, since no attack was in progress at the time of the shooting, the shooter was charged with two counts of cruelty to animals and one count of recklessly endangering another person, the latter a result of there being a house within the possible line of fire. There were no residents at home at the time of the shooting. On September 11, 2013, the shooter was convicted on two counts of animal cruelty. He faces up to five years in jail for each count.\nNico (2015), an adopted Bernese mountain dog, became a hero when he saved two people who were being swept out into the ocean by a California rip current.\nBella saved owner Chris Larocque from a burning house by pulling him out. The owner had reduced mobility from the injuries inflicted, and said that he would have died without Bella's help.\nIzzy survived the destruction of her family's Northern California home in the October 2017 Northern California wildfires and emerged from the woods with her tail wagging as her family investigated the ruins. Family members captured the reunion on video.\nBr\u00f3d and S\u00edoda are the pet dogs of the President of Ireland Michael D.

The coat is short, smooth and harsh to the touch. Weight is between 52\u201370 lbs and height is 60\u201370 cm at the shoulder for males and 58\u201362 cm for females.\nThe F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale standard suggests the dog should gallop easily in its movement. The standard for the breed was established in 1886.\nThe Billy is not suitable for a small house; needing a lot of exercise and being difficult to restrain and extremely fast.\n\n\n== History and use ==\nThe Billy was created by Monsieur Gaston Hublot de Rivault in the 19th century, and was named after his home the Ch\u00e2teau de Billy, in Poitou. Billys we created by combining the three original strains of the Poitevin, the Montemboeuf, Ceris and Larrye. Whereas the modern Poitevin more closely resembles and the original Tri-coloured Larrye line, Rivault was more drawn to the paler colours associated with the Montemboeuf and Ceris lines, and colouration was a major determinant when selecting foundation stock. The pack was dispersed in 1927 and the breed almost faced extinction, only two hounds survived World War II, however de Rivault's son, Anthony, set about reviving the breed by judicious use of the Poitevin, the Porcelaine and the Harrier.The Billy was one of the foundation breeds used in the development of the Grand Anglo-Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Orange in the late 19th century.\nThe Billy remains a rare breed, although there are several packs in its native France used to hunt roe deer, and two packs to hunt wild boar.\n\n\n== See also ==\nScenthound\nScenthound Group\nHound\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAlderton, David, Hounds of the World, Swan Hill Press, Shrewsbury, 2000, ISBN 1-85310-912-6.\nCunliffe, Juliette, The Encyclopedia of Dog Breeds Parragon, 2001, ISBN 0-7525-6561-3.\nFederation Cynologique Internationale, Billy, retrieved 12 Dec 14.\nFogle, Bruce, The Encyclopedia of the Dog, DK Publishing, New York, 2009, ISBN 978-0-7566-6004-8.\nHancock, David, Hounds: Hunting by Scent, The Crowood Press Ltd, Marlborough, 2014, ISBN 978-1-84797-601-7."}, {"id": 70, "name": "Black and Tan Coonhound", "country": "United States", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog70", "description": "The Black and Tan Coonhound is a breed of hunting dog.  Developed in the United States from crosses between the Bloodhound and the Black and Tan Virginia Foxhound, this scent hound runs its game entirely by scent and is used primarily for  coon hunting.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nAccording to the FCI breed standard Black and Tan Coonhound males should be 25\u201327 inches (64\u201369 cm) in height with females slightly smaller at 23\u201325 inches (58\u201364 cm) although it does not specify a weight range. The United Kennel Club does however include guideline weights of males 50\u201375 pounds (23\u201334 kg) with females ranging from 40\u201365 pounds (18\u201329 kg). The height proportions quoted by the UKC differ from the FCI and allow males to be 23\u201327 inches (58\u201369 cm) and females 21\u201326 inches (53\u201366 cm). The coat is short, dense and glossy.\nThe eyes are hazel to brown, the ears are long, wide, and thin, are set low and far back on the dog's head, and hang well down the neck. The black and tan markings are similar to the Doberman's and the Rottweiler's. The Black and Tan Coonhound's bark is loud and baying; it has been described as a deep howl. The breed standard includes muscular legs that are long in proportion to body length. The tail is set slightly below the natural line of the back. If the dog is alert or excited it carries its tail at a right angle.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Black and Tan Coonhound makes a suitable pet: it is mellow, amiable, calm, and unobtrusive indoors; outdoors, its strong hunting instinct takes over and it can be difficult to turn it from tracking after it starts trailing. As befitting a dog with its heritage, it is strong, independent, and stubborn. The Black and Tan Coonhound is gentle and tolerant with children, but it may be too independent to satisfy a playful child. It is reserved with strangers and in their presence may bay and howl. The Black and Tan Coonhound can run for miles although it is usually content with a moderate jog or long walk, with an occasional excursion into the field. It can wander if it catches a scent, so a safe area is mandatory.\n\n\n=== Use ===\nThe courage of the Coonhound also makes it proficient on the hunt for deer, bear, wolf, cougar and other big game although many US states have restricted the hunting of antlered animals with dogs.\nHowever, the primary purpose of the Black and Tan Coonhound is as a raccoon hunting dog. The general impression is that of power, agility and alertness, as well as the ability to cover ground swiftly with powerful rhythmic strides. Each hound has its own distinctive voice which is often recognizable to its owners from a great distance.\n\n\n=== General care ===\nIts coat needs only occasional brushing. Most Coonhounds drool to some extent, and the face may need regular wiping. The ears should also be checked regularly to ensure against ear infections.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nBlack and Tan Coonhounds are generally healthy, although there is some risk of hip dysplasia, ear cancer and other ear infections, and eye problems. Litter size is generally eight puppies. Expected longevity is 10\u201312 years.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Black and Tan Coonhound is descended from the Talbot Hound, found in medieval England after the eleventh century. Its ancestry is then traced through the Bloodhound and the Foxhound to the Black and Tan Virginia Foxhound.In 1945, the Black and Tan Coonhound became the first of the six varieties of Coonhound to be recognized by the American Kennel Club, in the Hound Group. The other varieties, which were not recognized until the 2010s, are the Redbone Coonhound, Plott Hound, Bluetick Coonhound, the English Coonhound, and the Treeing Walker Coonhound.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nwww.abtcc.com/ American Black and Tan Coonhound Club (AKC Parent club)\n\nAmerican Black And Tan Coonhound Association\nAmerican Black And Tan Coonhound Rescue"}, {"id": 71, "name": "Black and Tan Virginia Foxhound", "country": "United States", "type": "", "picture": "dog71", "description": "The Black And Tan Virginia Foxhound is an American dog breed and one of four foxhound breeds.  In the 18th century it was crossbred with the Bloodhound, and gave rise to the Black and Tan Coonhound. It is good for fox hunting.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Black and Tan Virginia Foxhound is an American foxhound breed. It resulted of a cross breed with Bloodhounds in the 1700s. The breed was developed by the landed gentry in order to get a dog suitable for fox hunting. Besides the Black and Tan there are the Walker, Calhoun, Penn-Marydel, Goodman, July and Trigg, which all developed from similar crosses. The Black and Tan is believed to descend form hunting dogs imported to America by Robert Brooke in 1650. These hunting dogs were the ancestors of several varieties of American hounds and stayed with the Brooke family for more than 300 years. Afterwards French Foxhounds were bred in after George Washington received them as gifts from the Marquis de Lafayette. Much later, the breed's speed and stamina were improved introducing Irish Foxhounds.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe American foxhounds are lighter, taller and more agile than the English ones. They can grow to a height of 21-25 inches and can weigh between 65 and 75 pounds. These dogs have a keen sense of smell and are faster than other hounds. They are large dogs with long, straight-boned front legs and a large skull with pendant ears which frame the face. The ears are wide and flat to the head. The eyes are wide set and large with a friendly and intelligent expression. The tail is set moderately high with a slight upward curve and the coat is hard and short, and as the name suggests, a combination of black and tan on a white base. These dogs are not suitable to apartment living because they need a lot of exercise and also tend to put on weight easily. Otherwise, they are fairly healthy and not plagued by genetic disorders involving the hip and bones. Their life span is about 10\u201312 years. This breed has a friendly, pleasant, loyal and reliable temperament.\n\n\n== Care ==\nDue to the Black and Tan Virginia Foxhound's energetic temperament, it requires a lot of exercise and room. If this is not provided, it could become destructive in order to entertain itself. This can also be prevented with careful, patient training. These dogs also need socialization outside, and are not suitable for apartment living.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFoxhound\nFox hunting\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 72, "name": "Black Norwegian Elkhound", "country": "Norway", "type": "", "picture": "dog72", "description": "The Black Norwegian Elkhound (Norsk Elghund Svart) is a modern variant of the Grey Norwegian Elkhound.  It is a small Spitz breed and is very rare outside the Nordic countries of Scandinavia. It is bred for the same purpose as the Grey Norwegian Elkhound but is smaller, more agile, and easier to recognize in the snow. Historically, it is a much \"younger\" breed, first bred in Norway during the early 19th century. It is classified by the FCI as a hunting dog, although it is also used as a watchdog, guarddog and herder.\nThe AKC breed name \"Elkhound,\" comes directly from its original Norwegian name \"Elghund,\" meaning \"\"elk dog\" or moose dog.\" In Norwegian, \"elg\" refers to the animal English speakers know as an \"elk\" or \"moose\", and \"hund\" means \"dog.\"\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Black Norwegian Elkhound is a typical Spitz breed with a short compact body, dark eyes, ears standing straight up, and a curly tail carried over the back. It has a rich coat that does not stand out from the body. This is an all-weather hunting dog and the coat is very important. It must be able to keep out the heavy autumn rain in Scandinavia and endure the cold weather, which it does very well.\nIt has a dense, short, thick, coarse, double coat and is solid black. A mature dog stands between 40 and 51 centimeters (16\"-20\") - 47 cm (+3/-4) for males and 44 cm (+3/-4) for females - and weighs between 16 kilograms (35 lb) and 20 kilograms (44 lb).\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Black Norwegian Elkhound is a very robust and hardy dog: very alert and full of power and pride. It is more strong-minded than the Grey Elkhound. The most recommended training method is one that focuses on motivating the dog; such as clicker training or reward-based training methods. Using punishment or dominance-based methods could negatively impact training with the Black Norwegian Elkhound. It is easy to train, but always needs something to do to be happy. It needs continuous exercise and activity in concert with its superb intelligence to do well. It is an excellent hunting dog and loves to be in the forest.\n\n\n==== Hunting ====\nThe Black Elkhound is used in all types of hunts but excels best in hunting large game such as elk, moose and bear. It is very good at tracking and makes an excellent watch dog. It is a good family dog but can sometimes be a bit contentious in relations with other dogs. The Elkhound has been an important dog for farmers in Scandinavia for hundreds of years.\n\n\n== Care ==\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\nIts coat requires frequent brushing.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKarelian Bear Dog\nNorwegian Buhund\nNorwegian Elkhound\nNorwegian Lundehund\nSwedish Jamthund\nSwedish Lapphund\nSwedish Vallhund\nTahltan Bear Dog (extinct)\n\n\n== Resources ==\nBooks\nNorwegian Elkhound (Comprehensive Owner's Guide), 2005.\nNorwegian Elkhounds by Anna Katherine Nicholas.

At the present time, the Black Russian Terrier is a breed recognized by the FCI (FCI's from September 1983), AKC (AKC's from July 2004), CKC, KC, ANKC, NZKC and other cynological organizations. The contemporary Black Russian Terrier is a working dog, guarding dog, sporting and companion dog.\nDespite its name, the Black Russian Terrier is not a true terrier: it is believed that about seventeen breeds were used in its development, including the Airedale, the Giant Schnauzer, the Rottweiler, the Newfoundland, the Caucasian Shepherd Dog and other breeds.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Black Russian Terrier was developed in the former USSR in Red Star (Krasnaya Zvezda) Kennel by the state for use as a military/working dogs. The breeding stock was largely imported from countries where the Red Army was active during the Second World War, especially East Germany. Breeds used in the development include the Giant Schnauzer, Airedale Terrier, Rottweiler, Newfoundland, Caucasian Shepherd Dog and other breeds. BRT were bred for working ability, rather than appearance, and early examples only resembled today's Black Russian Terrier in their build and coat type. The BRT was bred solely by the state owned Red Star Kennel in Moscow until 1957, when some puppies were sold to civilian breeders. These breeders began to breed for looks (as the original was rather plain) while retaining working ability. In time, the breed spread to the other parts of USSR like Saint Petersburg, Siberia, Ukraine and later to the first European country Finland and next to the other European countries: Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Germany and finally to the United States, Canada, Australia and others.\nIn 1955 the first working examples of the breed were put on show at an exhibition in Moscow and the first Breed Standard was published in 1958, which was then adopted by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1984. In 1996 The Russian Federation Working Dog-breeders & Russian Kynological Federation (RKF) adopted a second Standard for the breed more in line to the modern day Russian Black Terrier. And it was also in 1996 that the breed was first introduced into the UK. In 1998 The Kennel Club added the Russian Black Terrier to the Import Register.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nThe coat is a double coat with a coarse outer guard hair over a softer undercoat. The coat is hard and dense, never soft, woolly, silky or frizzy. It should be trimmed to between 5 and 15 cm (2-6 inches) in length. It should form a beard and eyebrows on the face, and a slight mane around the withers and neck that is more pronounced in males. The coat is low-shedding and the colour is black or black with some scattered gray hairs.\n\n\n=== Size ===\nAccording to the FCI standard the male stands 72 to 76 cm and not more than 78 cm at the withers compared to the female\u2019s 68\u201372 cm and not more than 74 cm. The male weighs between 50 and 60 kg (110-132 lbs), and the females weigh between 45 and 50 kg (99-110 lbs). Nowadays, even larger individuals are tolerated if the dog is well proportioned and retains correct movements.\nAt maturity (over 18 months of age), the AKC standard recommends 27-30 inches for males with the desired height between 27 and 29 inches and 26 and 29 inches for females with the desired height between 26 and 28 inches. A mature male less than 27 inches or more than 30 inches at the withers is considered a serious fault. A mature female less than 26 inches or more than 29 inches at the withers is considered a serious fault. Although the standard also states \"Height consideration should not outweigh that of type, proportion, movement and other functional attributes.\" In proportions, a Black Russian Terrier should be slightly longer than tall, a ratio of 9 \u00bd to 10 being ideal.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe character and temperament of the Black Russian Terrier is of utmost importance. The Black Russian Terrier is a calm, confident, courageous and self-assured dog. He is highly intelligent and adapts well to training. The Black Russian Terrier was initially bred to guard and protect. He is alert and responsive, instinctively protective, determined, fearless, deeply loyal to family, is aloof and therefore does not relish intrusion by strangers into his personal space. Shyness or excessive excitability is a serious fault.\n\n\n== Care ==\nThe Black Russian Terrier, because of its breeding as a working dog, has a very strong \"work ethic\", and needs a job to do in order to be happy. Early training is a must and they are very responsive to firm, consistent training, excelling at Obedience competitions. They also perform well in other dog sports, such as Agility, and Schutzhund training. \nThey have a low-shedding coat, and need grooming several times a week. Dogs who compete in conformation need to be groomed a minimum of every three weeks to keep the coat in show condition. The Black Russian Terrier needs lots of exercise, and may become hyperactive and destructive if it does not have a chance to burn off its energy.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Black Russian Terrier is a generally healthy and somewhat long-lived dog (lifespan of 9\u201314 years), however it is prone to certain hereditary diseases:\nMajor concerns:\nHip dysplasia\nElbow dysplasia\nHyperuricosuria\nJuvenile laryngeal paralysis and polyneuropathyMinor concerns\n\nHypertrophic osteodystrophy (HOD) - a nutritionally based developmental disease especially in young, heavy, fast-growing puppies;\nPanosteitis (Pano or Wandering Lameness) - a nutritionally based developmental disease especially in young, heavy, fast-growing puppies;\nHeart Disease - the most common heart problems are aortic stenosis, mitral valve dysplasia, cardiomyopathy;\nEyes Disease - the most common eyes problems are ectropion, entropion, conjunctivitis;\nAllergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Black Russian Terrier is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, contact allergies and inhalant allergies;Other problems\n\nHot spot;\nFungal infection - especially in ears and beard area.This is why it is extremely important to screen any potential breeders as well as their breeding stock. A well intended breeder will have all health checks on all breeding stock before making the decision to breed their dogs. While health checks on breeding stock can not guarantee a puppy will not develop any health issues later on, it is important to \"do your homework\" on any potential breeder.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nBlack Russian Terrier at Curlie\nBlack Russian Terrier Breed Database\nBlack Russian Terrier - Database\nAll about Black Russian Terriers in Poland Portal \"\u015awiat Czarnego Teriera\"\nPolish BRT Foundation \"Czernysz w Potrzebie\""}, {"id": 74, "name": "Black Mouth Cur", "country": "United States", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog74", "description": "The Black Mouth Cur is a hunting and cattle dog that has its origins in Southern United States.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Black Mouth Cur is a well-muscled rugged herding, hunting, and all around utility (or work) dog whose coat comes in a number of colors and shades, generally all shades of fawn from nearly white to mahogany.  Solid white and piebald colors are not allowed in Black Mouth Curs, but in rare occasions may appear in a litter due to recessive genes. According to the breed standard of the United Kennel Club, up to ten percent of the coat may be white with the amounts of white on the toes, tail, nose and chest are acceptable but not desired. As of this date the Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Cur is recognized by UKC as the Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog and the Plott Cur has been renamed the Plott Hound. \nThe name \"cur\" is a descriptive term for a general, short-coated, drop-eared, farm and ranch working dog. Black Mouth Curs are primarily herding dogs able to hunt big or small game, but they are also suitable as family dogs. The breed has an average litter size of 3-12, and a lifespan of 12\u201318 years.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nBlack Mouth Curs have short coats, either coarse or fine, and a combination of the two types may appear in the same litter. \nBlack Mouth Curs come in many colors. All shades of red, yellow and fawn; black; brown; buckskin; or brindle; with or without black muzzle or mask. Very small amounts of white are allowed under the chin, around the nose, on the neck, chest, legs, and tip of tail, provided that no more than ten percent total of the dog's body may be white. Dilute coat colors are acceptable and may be identified by the following traits: green, yellow, or light brown eyes; white toenails; red or yellow coat without any trace of black hair. Never spotted, mottled, merle, or with white collar. A disqualification is albinism.The muzzle is square-shaped. It may have a melanistic mask, which is most often black. Maskless dogs are allowed but not preferred. The name 'Black Mouth' refers to the dark pigmentation around the lips that also extends into the interior of the mouth including the roof of the mouth, gums, and cheeks, excluding the tongue. The ears are medium-sized and hanging and may either be melanistic like the muzzle or the same color as the coat.\nThe tail of a Black Mouth Cur can be of any length; long, medium, bob tailed, or none at all. Some owners of curs that are born with a tail will dock their dog's tail, and some cur dogs are born with little or no tail at all. The feet are of moderate size, compact and well arched. Pads are large, tough, and well cushioned. Toes may be webbed. Single or double dewclaws may be present.The adult weight ranges depending on the line, from 35 pounds minimum for tree dogs (i.e. Ladner BMCs) to over 100 pounds for herding or hog dogs (i.e. the Weatherford Ben line). Their height can also vary with a minimum height of 16 inches tall. Males in the same lines are normally larger than females.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nBlack Mouth Curs are great family dogs. They are very social dogs if trained properly. The BMC is an \"extremely smart\" breed who \"by nature need to bond a few weeks\" with their owner/trainer before training can begin.  They are sensitive dogs that are attuned to their master's voice and should never be yelled at in anger or spanked.  BMCs make good family dogs as long as they have at least an acre of yard which they can access throughout the day.  This dog will not be happy spending the day on the couch alone. They are very social dogs and need a human companion.  These must have access to several hours of exercise daily to avoid anxiety and depression.   \"The BMC was bred as a homestead dog that would protect its family and home against intruders. This means that a well-bred BMC is territorial. Most BMCs off their 'turf' work well with other dogs, hunting or herding stock, but on their family property will chase the same dog away. Their turf can be viewed by the dog as the family\u2019s home, land, truck, or sometimes proximity to 'their person'.\"\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\"The BMC is genetically very athletic and eager to please. Given proper guidance and training, a BMC can excel in just about any activity you could imagine. They can herd animals, track or trail game, pull weights, run in a coursing event, work as a Search and Rescue dog, or anything else a smart, athletic dog that wants to please its owner can do.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Black Mouth Curs, as a breed, have varied historical documentation dependent upon region. Among them are the Southern Black Mouth Cur from Alabama, Foundation Black Mouth Cur from Texas, Ladner Yellow Black Mouth Cur from Mississippi, and the Florida Black Mouth Cur, sometimes called a cracker cur.The first Black Mouth Curs registered with a national kennel registry were the Ladner Black Mouth Curs through the National Kennel Club in April 1964.The Texas Black Mouth Cur comes from a line of curs well-documented in the book Big Thicket Legacy.  They are used primarily for herding cattle. \nThe Florida Black Mouth Cur, used for herding cattle, are featured in old paintings hanging in local barber shops and homes, so their existence and history in Florida is documented.The Southern Black Mouth Cur, is believed to have originated in Alabama, though there are Southern Black Mouth Cur in Florida and Tennessee. The Howard Line of Southern Black Mouth Curs were the first registered Line of Black Mouth Curs, with a legitimate, and well documented outside source. They were registered with the courthouse around Howardtown, Alabama about 40 miles north of Mobile and nearby Tibbie in the early 1940s. These dogs were bred for well over 100 years prior to registration with the courthouse. They were used as multipurpose pioneer dogs that would hunt, protect the home, and gather in the cattle and pigs at slaughter time. Several breeders through the South continue to work toward retaining and improving the Southern Black Mouth  Cur. Through the efforts of several Black Mouth Cur breeders, the United Kennel Club later recognized the breed. Some of the first dogs originate with the Howard family. Mr. JD Howard can be found as being a descendant of Howardtown, and the Southern Black Mouth Cur heritage. Mr. JD Howard carried on the long family tradition for many years. His legacy is being continued by family member Mr. Steve Howard, who is still actively improving and breeding the Southern Black Mouth Cur.\n\n\n== In Popular Culture ==\nThe Black Mouth Cur became a title character in Fred Gipson's famous novel, Old Yeller.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Blackmouth Cur at Wikimedia Commons"}, {"id": 75, "name": "Grand Bleu de Gascogne", "country": "France", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog75", "description": "The Grand Bleu de Gascogne (FCI No.22) is a breed of dog of the scenthound type, originating in France and used for hunting in packs. Today's breed is the descendant of a very old type of large hunting dog, and is an important breed in the ancestry of many other hounds.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe  Grand Bleu de Gascogne is an imposing large dog, a typical hunting pack hound of the oldest type, with a lean and muscular body, long legs, slightly domed head, long drop ears, and drooping lips. Size is 65 to 72 cm (25.6 to 28.3 ins) at the withers, females slightly smaller. Dogs of this breed should show an attitude of calm strength and nobleness.The colour of the coat is white mottled with black, giving a slate blue overall appearance. There are black patches on either side of the head, with a white area on top of the head which has in it a small black oval. Tan \"eyebrow\" marks are over each eye. Faults are deviations in appearance that have an effect on the health and working ability of the dog, as well as an absence of expected features of colour, structure, and size, indicating that a dog with such faults should not be bred. Faults include aggression or fearfulness, anatomical malformation, and lack of type.Although these are large dogs, \"Grand\" does not necessarily refer to the size of the dogs. \"In most cases it is simply a label for a pack that is used for larger game\". Today. the breed is used in hunting boar, deer, and other game.\nThe Grand Bleu de Gascogne is a very large dog weighing 80-120 lbs\n\n\n=== Health and temperament ===\nNo unusual health problems or claims of extraordinary health have been documented for this breed. Temperament of individual dogs may vary.\n\n\n== History and use ==\nThe Grand Bleu de Gascogne may descend from dogs left by Phoenician traders, its ancestors were contemporaries with the St Hubert Hound and English Southern Hound, Comte de Foix kept a pack in the 14th century and Henry IV of France kept a pack in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.\nThe Grand Bleu de Gascogne has a long history in the US, the first dogs were bred there in the 18th century; more Grand Bleus are now in the US than France. General Lafayette presented a pack of seven Grand Bleus to George Washington in 1785, who compared their melodious voices to the bells of Moscow.The Grand Bleu de Gascogne is noted for its focus on the hunt, as well as a good nose and distinctive, sonorous, deep howl, the breed is \"instinctively a pack hound\". In the past, it was used to hunt deer, wolves, and boar; in the field it is considered a rather slow and ponderous worker and today is predominantly used to hunt hares.The Grand Bleu de Gascogne has had a significant influence on the development of several breeds of scent hounds. After the French Revolution, it was used to revitalise the old Saintongeois, creating the Gascon Saintongeois, and the Bluetick Coonhound is considered a direct descendant of the Grand Bleu. The Grand Bleu de Gascogne was used by Sir John Buchanan-Jardine in the development of the Dumfriesshire Hound; in Britain, any native hounds with blue marbled coats are still referred to as 'Frenchies' after this breed.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnglo French and French Hounds\nDog terminology\nPetit Bleu de Gascogne\nGriffon Bleu de Gascogne\nBasset Bleu de Gascogne\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAlderton, David, Hounds of the World, Swan Hill Press, Shrewsbury, 2000, ISBN 1-85310-912-6.\nClarke, Anne R., Brace, Andrew H. & Sporre-Willes, Renee, The International Encyclopedia of Dogs, Wiley, 1995, ISBN 0-87605-624-9.\nFederation Cynologique Internationale, Great Gascony Blue, retrieved 15 Dec 14.\nFogle, Bruce, The Encyclopedia of the Dog, DK Publishing, New York, 2009, ISBN 978-0-7566-6004-8.\nHancock, David, Hounds: Hunting by Scent, The Crowood Press Ltd, Marlborough, 2014, ISBN 978-1-84797-601-7.\n\n\n== External links ==\nSearch The Open Directory Project (DMOZ) links for clubs and information about the Grand Bleu de Gascogne"}, {"id": 76, "name": "Petit Bleu de Gascogne", "country": "France", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog76", "description": "The Petit Bleu de Gascogne (FCI No.31) Is a breed of dog of the scenthound type, originating in France and used for hunting in packs.

The Petit Bleu de Gascogne is not a small (petite) dog, the name comes from its use on small game.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Petit Bleu de Gascogne is directly descended from the Grand Bleu de Gascogne, a hound of ancient type. Smaller examples of the Grand Bleu de Gascogne were selected for hunting small game such as hare (the Grand Bleu de Gascogne was developed to hunt wolves, bears and boars) and eventually became a separate breed.

Believed to be descended from hounds once kept at the Abbey of Saint-Hubert, Belgium, it is known to French speakers as the Chien de Saint-Hubert.\nThis breed is famed for its ability to discern human scent over great distances, even days later.  Its extraordinarily keen sense of smell is combined with a strong and tenacious tracking instinct, producing the ideal scent hound, and it is used by police and law enforcement all over the world to track escaped prisoners, missing people, and lost pets.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nBloodhounds weigh from 36 to 72 kg (80 to 160 lbs). They are 58 to 69 cm (23 to 27 inches) tall at the withers. According to the AKC standard for the breed, larger dogs are preferred by conformation judges. Acceptable colors for bloodhounds are black, liver, tan, and red. Bloodhounds possess an unusually large skeletal structure with most of their weight concentrated in their bones, which are very thick for their length. The coat typical for a scenthound is hard and composed of fur alone, with no admixture of hair.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThis breed is gentle, and is tireless when following a scent. Because of its strong tracking instinct, it can be willful and somewhat difficult to obedience train and handle on a leash. Bloodhounds have an affectionate and even-tempered nature with humans, making excellent family pets. However, like any pet, they require supervision when around small children.\n\n\n== Colour types ==\n\nUp to at least the seventeenth century bloodhounds were of all colours, but in modern times the colour range has become more restricted. The colours are usually listed as black and tan, liver and tan, and red. White is not uncommon on the chest, and sometimes appears on the feet. Genetically, the main types are determined by the action of two genes, found in many species. One produces an alternation between black and brown (liver). If a hound inherits the black allele (variant) from either parent, it has a black nose, eye rims and paw-pads, and if it has a saddle, it is black. The other allele suppresses black pigment and is recessive, so it must be inherited from both parents. It produces liver noses, eye rims, paw-pads, and saddles.\nThe second gene determines coat pattern. It can produce animals with no saddle (essentially all-tan, but called 'red' in bloodhounds); ones with saddle-marking; or ones largely covered with darker (black or liver) pigment, except for tan lips, eyebrows, forechest and lower legs. These last are sometimes referred to as 'blanket' or 'full-coat' types. In a pioneering study in 1969 Dennis Piper suggested 5 alleles in the pattern-marking gene, producing variants from the red or saddle-less hound through three different types of progressively greater saddle marking to the 'blanket' type. However, more modern study attributes the variation to 3 different alleles of the Agouti gene.  Ay produces the non saddle-marked \"red\" hound, As produces saddle-marking, and at produces the blanket or full-coat hound.  Of these Ay  is dominant, and at is recessive to the others. The interaction of these variants of the two genes produces the six basic types shown below.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nIt is likely that a third gene determines whether or not there is a melanistic mask. Em, the allele for a mask, is dominant over E, the allele for no mask.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n=== Illnesses ===\nCompared to other purebred dogs, Bloodhounds suffer an unusually high rate of gastrointestinal ailments, with gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat) being the most common type of gastrointestinal problem. The breed also suffers an unusually high incidence of eye, skin, and ear ailments; thus these areas should be inspected frequently for signs of developing problems. Owners should be especially aware of the signs of bloat, which is both the most common illness and the leading cause of death of Bloodhounds. The thick coat gives the breed the tendency to overheat quickly.\n\n\n=== Lifespan ===\nBloodhounds in a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey had a median longevity of 6.75 years, which makes them one of the shortest-lived of dog breeds. The oldest of the 82 deceased dogs in the survey died at the age of 12.1 years. Bloat took 34% of the animals, making it the most common cause of death in Bloodhounds. The second leading cause of death in the study was cancer, at 27%; this percentage is similar to other breeds, but the median age of death was unusually young (median of about 8 years). In a 2013 survey, the average age at death for 14 Bloodhounds was 8.25 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Chien de Saint-Hubert ===\nThe St. Hubert hound was, according to legend, first bred ca. 1000 AD by monks at the Saint-Hubert Monastery in Belgium; its likely origins are in France, home of many of modern hounds. It is held to be the ancestor of several other breeds, like the extinct Norman hound, and Saintongeois, and the modern Grand Bleu de Gascogne, Gascon Saintongeois, Ariegeois and Artois Normande, as well as the bloodhound. It has been suggested that it was a dog of mixed breeding, not at all uniform in type.Whether they originated there, or what their ancestry was, is uncertain, but from ca. 1200, the monks of the Abbey of St Hubert annually sent several pairs of black hounds as a gift to the King of France. They were not always highly thought of in the royal pack. Charles IX 1550-74, preferred his white hounds and the larger Chiens-gris, and wrote that the St Huberts were suitable for people with gout to follow, but not for those who wished to shorten the life of the hunted animal. He described them as pack-hounds of medium stature, long in the body, not well sprung in the rib, and of no great strength.  Writing in 1561 Jaques du Fouilloux describes them as strong of body, but with low, short legs. He says they have become mixed in breeding, so that they are now of all colours and widely distributed. Charles described the 'true race' of the St Hubert as black, with red/tawny marks above the eyes and legs usually of the same colour, suggesting a 'blanket' black and tan (see Section on Colour types above). To De Fouilloux the 'pure black' were the best of this mixed breed. Both writers thought them only useful as leash hounds. They both refer to a white hound, also a St Hubert, which by their time had disappeared, having been interbred with another white hound, the greffier, to produce the king's preferred pack hound, sometimes called the chien blanc du roi.\nThey appear to have been more highly thought of during the reign of Henry IV (1553\u20131610), who presented a pack to James I of England. By the end of the reign of Louis XIV (1715), they were already rare. In 1788, D'Yauville, who was master of the Royal hounds, says those sent by the St Hubert monks, once much prized, had degenerated, and scarcely one of the annual gift of six or eight was kept.Upon the French Revolution of 1789, the gifts ceased, and hunting in France went into a decline until the end of the Napoleonic wars. When it recovered during the 19th Century, huntsmen, with many breeds to choose from, seem to have had little interest in the St Hubert. An exception was Baron Le Couteulx de Canteleu, who tried to find them. He reported that there were hardly any in France, and those in the Ardennes were so cross-bred that they had lost the characteristics of the breed.Writers on the bloodhound in the last two centuries generally agreed that the original St Hubert strain died out in the nineteenth century, and that the European St Hubert owes its present existence to the development of the Bloodhound.\n\n\n=== Bloodhound ===\n\nReferences to bloodhounds first appear in English writing in the early to mid 14th century, in contexts that suggest the breed was well established by then. It is often claimed that its ancestors were brought over from Normandy by William the Conqueror, but there is no actual evidence for this. That the Normans brought hounds from Europe during the post-Conquest period is virtually certain, but whether they included the Bloodhound itself, rather than merely its ancestors, is a matter of dispute that probably cannot be resolved on the basis of surviving evidence.\nIn Medieval hunting the typical use of the Bloodhound was as a 'limer', or 'lyam-hound', that is a dog handled on a leash or 'lyam', to find the hart or boar before it was hunted by the pack hounds (raches). It was prized for its ability to hunt the cold scent of an individual animal, and, though it did not usually take part in the kill, it was given a special reward from the carcass.It also seems that from the earliest times the Bloodhound was used to track people. There are stories written in Medieval Scotland of Robert the Bruce (in 1307), and William Wallace (1270\u20131305) being followed by 'sleuth hounds'. Whether true or not, these stories show that the sleuth hound was already known as a man-trailer, and it later becomes clear that the sleuth hound and the Bloodhound were the same animal.\nIn the 16th century, John Caius, in the most important single source in the history of the Bloodhound, describes its hanging ears and lips, its use in game parks to follow the scent of blood, which gives it its name, its ability to track thieves and poachers by their foot scent, how it casts if it has lost the scent when thieves cross water, and its use on the Scottish borders to track cross-border raiders, known as Border Reivers. This links it to the sleuth hound, and from Caius also comes the information that the English Bloodhound and the sleuth hound were essentially the same, though the Bloodhound was slightly bigger, with more variation in coat colour.The adjacent picture was published in Zurich in 1563, in Conrad Gesner's Thierbuch (a compendium of animals) with the captions: 'Englischen Bl\u00fcthund' and 'Canis Sagax Sanguinarius apud Anglos' (English scent hound with associations of blood). It was drawn by, or under the supervision of, John Caius, and sent to Gesner with other drawings to illustrate his descriptions of British dogs for European readers. It is thus the earliest known picture published specifically to demonstrate the appearance of the Bloodhound. We are told it was done from life, and detail such as the soft hang of the ear indicates it was carefully observed. Fully accurate or not, it suggests changes between the Bloodhound of then and today. The collar and long coiled rope reflect the Bloodhound's typical functions as a limer or leashed man-trailer in that period.\nThe earliest known report of a trial of the Bloodhound's trailing abilities comes from the scientist Robert Boyle, who described how a Bloodhound tracked a man seven miles along a route frequented by people, and found him in an upstairs room of a house.With the rise of fox-hunting, the decline of deer-hunting, and the extinction of the wild boar, as well as a more settled state of society, the use of the Bloodhound diminished. It was kept by the aristocratic owners of a few deer-parks and by a few enthusiasts, with some variation in type, until its popularity began to increase again with the rise of dog-showing in the 19th Century. Numbers, however, have remained low in Britain. Very few survived the Second World War, but the gene-pool has gradually been replenished with imports from America. Nevertheless, because of UK quarantine restrictions, importing was expensive and difficult, throughout the 20th century, and in the post-war period exports to the USA, and to Europe where the population had also been affected by the war, considerably exceeded imports.During the later 19th century numbers of Bloodhounds were imported from Britain by French enthusiasts, who regretted the extinction of the ancient St Hubert. They wished to re-establish it, using the Bloodhound, which, despite its developments in Britain, they regarded as the St Hubert preserved unchanged. Many of the finest specimens were bought and exhibited and bred in France as Chiens de S. Hubert, especially by Le Couteulx de Canteleu, who himself bred over 300. Whatever few original St Huberts remained either died out or were absorbed into the new population. As a result, the Bloodhound became known on parts of the Continent as the Chien de Saint-Hubert. In the mid 20th century the Brussels-based FCI accepted the claim of Belgium to be the country of origin. There are now annual celebrations in the town of Saint-Hubert, in which handlers in period dress parade their hounds. In Britain the bloodhound has continued to be seen as a native breed, with European St Huberts being accepted by the UK KC as bloodhounds.In Le Couteulx' book of 1890 we read that 'Le Chien de St Hubert actuel' is very big, from 0m,69 to 0m,80 (27\u00bd-31\u00bdin) high. This does not accord with the 16th century descriptions of the St Hubert given above, nor with the FCI standard, but the idea that the St Hubert is much bigger (up to 0.915m, 36 in) than the Bloodhound persisted well into the 20th century, among some St Hubert enthusiasts.When the first Bloodhounds were exported to the USA is not known. Bloodhounds were used to track runaway slaves before the American Civil War, but it has been questioned whether the dogs used were genuine Bloodhounds. However, in the later part of the 19th century, and in the next, more pure Bloodhounds were introduced from Britain, and bred in America, especially after 1888, when the English breeder, Edwin Brough, brought three of his hounds to exhibit at the Westminster KC show in New York City. He went into partnership with Mr J L Winchell, who with other Americans, imported more stock from Britain. Bloodhounds in America have been more widely used in tracking lost people and criminals - often with brilliant success - than in Britain, and the history of the Bloodhound in America is full of the man-trailing exploits of outstanding Bloodhounds and their expert handlers, the most famous hound being Nick Carter. Law enforcement agencies have been much involved in the use of Bloodhounds, and there is a National Police Bloodhound Association, originating in 1962.In Britain there have been instances from time to time of the successful use of the Bloodhound to track criminals or missing people. However man-trailing is enjoyed as a sport by British Bloodhound owners, through national working trials, and this enthusiasm has spread to Europe. In addition, while the pure Bloodhound is used to hunt singly, bloodhound packs use bloodhounds crossed with foxhounds to hunt the human scent.\nMeanwhile, the Bloodhound has become widely distributed internationally, though numbers are small in most countries, with more in the USA than anywhere else. Following the spread of the Bloodhound from Britain in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, imports and exports and, increasingly, artificial insemination, are maintaining the world population as a common breeding stock, without a great deal of divergence in type in different countries.During the late 19th century, Bloodhounds were frequent subjects for artists such as Edwin Landseer and Briton Riviere; the dogs depicted are close in appearance to modern Bloodhounds, indicating that the essential character of the Bloodhound predates modern dog breeding. However, the dogs depicted by Landseer show less wrinkle and haw than modern dogs.\n\n\n== Origin issues ==\nThroughout most of its history the bloodhound was seen as a dog of English or Anglo-Scottish origin, either of unknown ancestry, or, more recently, as developed in part from the St. Hubert. It was only in the 19th century that it was claimed, primarily by Le Couteulx, to be the St Hubert itself. Medieval hunting pictures show raches and limers, of the general sagax type, with hanging ears and lips, but not having the specific characteristics of the bloodhound. 16th century descriptions of the St Hubert as short-legged, and only medium-sized have led to speculation that the main European antecedent of the bloodhound was rather the Norman hound, which was very large, than the St Hubert. Others such as the sleuth-hound, the Talbot, the dun-hound and the southern hound, as well as pack hounds, have also been supposed to have contributed to its make-up. Some writers doubt whether anything certain can be said about specific breed ancestry beyond the last few centuries. The picture given by Le Couteulx and D'Yauville of the St Hubert was that it changed considerably through mixed breeding, and perhaps degenerated, before its disappearance, while the bloodhound which replaced it, preserved its original character. However, it is apparent from 16th century pictures that the bloodhound itself has changed considerably. The modern St Hubert is the English bloodhound, in descent and type. Generally, national and regional variants of hounds, terriers, spaniels etc. have been recognised as separate breeds, France in particular having many regional breeds of hound; the bloodhound's identification as the St Hubert makes it an anomaly in this respect. Whether the bloodhound is British or Belgian in origin is ultimately not something one can prove historically, depending as it does on whether one chooses to regard two related animals differing in tradition, and history, and somewhat in type, as separate breeds, or variants of the same one.\n\n\n== Breed standard ==\nDescriptions of the desirable physical qualities of a hunting hound go back to Medieval books on hunting. All dogs used in the hunting field were 'gentle', that is of good breeding (not necessarily pure breeding), and parents were carefully chosen to maintain and improve conformation. In 1896, making some use of wording found in earlier descriptions, Edwin Brough and Dr J Sidney Turner published Points and Characteristics of the Bloodhound or Sleuth-Hound.  This was adopted by the newly formed Association of Bloodhound Breeders, and ultimately became, with very little change, the 'official' breed standard of the KC and the AKC.\nMeanwhile, the Belgian or Dutch Comte Henri de Bylandt, or H A graaf van Bylandt, published Races des Chiens in 1897, a huge and very important illustrated compilation of breed descriptions, or standards. In this French edition the Bloodhound appears as the Chien de St Hubert, although the pictures illustrating the standard are all of British Bloodhounds, many of them those of Edwin Brough. The book was revised and reprinted in four languages in 1904, and in this edition the English text of the standard is that of the  Association of Bloodhound Breeders, while the French text is closely based on it. However, the present FCI standard uses a quite different layout and wording.\nThe AKC standard has hardly been altered from the original of 1896, the principal change being that the colours, 'black and tan', 'red and tan', and 'tawny', have been renamed as 'black and tan', 'liver and tan', and 'red', but the British KC has made considerable changes. Some of these were simply matters of presentation and did not affect content. However, responding to the view that the requirements of some breed standards were potentially detrimental to the health or well-being of the animal, changes have been made affecting the required eye shape and the loose skin, the most recent revision being 2008-9.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word 'bloodhound' is recorded from c. 1330. Most recent accounts say that its etymological meaning is 'hound of pure or noble blood'. This derives from an original suggestion of Le Couteulx de Canteleu in the nineteenth century, which has been enthusiastically and uncritically espoused by later writers, perhaps because it absolved this undoubtedly good-natured dog from suggestions of bloodthirstiness. Neither Le Couteulx nor anyone since has offered any historical evidence to support this view. The suggestion sometimes seen that the word derives from 'blooded hound' is without basis, as the expression does not appear in early English, and 'blooded' in this meaning is not found before the late eighteenth century. Before then 'bloodhound' had been taken to mean, 'hound for blood', or 'blood-seeking hound'. This was the explanation put forward by John Caius, who was one of the most learned men of his time, and had an interest in etymology, in the sixteenth century. It is supported by considerable historical linguistic evidence, which can be gleaned from such sources as the Oxford English Dictionary (OED): the fact that first uses of the word 'blood' to refer to good breeding in an animal post date the first use of 'bloodhound'; that other comparable uses, as in 'blood-horse' and 'blood-stock' appear many centuries later; and that derogatory uses of the word 'bloodhound', which any suggestion of noble breeding would sadly weaken, appear from as early as c1400. Other early sources tell us that hounds were supposed to have an interest in blood, and that the bloodhound was used to follow the trail of a wounded animal.  In the absence of anything in early usage, or any historical evidence whatsoever, to support the modern explanation, the older must be regarded as correct.\nIn the 2012 on-line edition of the OED the entry for 'bloodhound' has been brought up to date, for the first time pronouncing specifically on the etymological meaning. Clearly the editors have found no historical plausibility in the idea that the name refers to good breeding, which they do not even mention.\n\n\n== Working the Bloodhound ==\n\n\n=== Scenting ability ===\nThe Bloodhound's physical characteristics account for its ability to follow a scent trail left several days in the past. The olfactory bulb in dogs is roughly forty times bigger than the olfactory bulb in humans, relative to total brain size, with 125 to 220 million olfactory receptors. Consequently, dogs have an olfactory sense 40 times more sensitive than that of a human. In some dog breeds, such as bloodhounds, the olfactory sense has nearly 300 million receptors.The large, long pendent ears serve to prevent wind from scattering nearby skin cells while the dog's nose is on the ground; the folds of wrinkled flesh under the lips and neck\u2014called the shawl\u2014serve to catch stray scent particles in the air or on a nearby branch as the bloodhound is scenting, reinforcing the scent in the dog's memory and nose. However, not all agree that the long ears and loose skin are functional, some regarding them as a handicap.\n\n\n=== Human trailing ===\nThere are many accounts of bloodhounds successfully following trails many hours, and even several days old,  the record being of a family found dead in Oregon, in 1954, over 330 hours after they had gone missing. The bloodhound is generally used to follow the individual scent of a fugitive or lost person, taking the scent from a 'scent article' \u2013 something the quarry is known to have touched, which could be an item of clothing, a car seat, an identified footprint etc. Many bloodhounds will follow the drift of scent a good distance away from the actual footsteps of the quarry, which can enable them to cut corners and reach the end of the trail more quickly. In America, sticking close to the footsteps is called 'tracking', while the freer method is known as 'trailing' (in the UK, 'hunting'), and is held to reflect the bloodhound's concentration on the individual human scent, rather than that of, say, vegetation crushed by the feet of the quarry. Having lost a scent, a good bloodhound will stubbornly cast about for long periods, if necessary, in order to recover it. The bloodhound is handled on a tracking harness, which has a metal ring above the shoulders, to which a leash is attached, so that the hound's neck is not jerked up when the leash becomes taut, as it would with a collar. The leash is at least long enough to allow the hound to cross freely in front of the handler, some handlers preferring quite a short leash, giving better communication with the hound, others liking something longer, maybe twenty or thirty feet.\n\n\n=== Training ===\nIt is generally agreed that the basis of initial training is to make the experience enjoyable for the puppy or young hound, to keep its enthusiasm high. Whitney preferred waiting till the hound is 18 months old, to start training, but others start as young as possible, say three months. Training can be started by running short trails on a family member whom the puppy sees walk away, at first remaining visible, and later going out of sight. Even though familiar with the scent of the 'runner', it can be given a scent-article to sniff, and given the command to follow. It can also be introduced to the tracking harness, which is put on just before the trail starts, and removed as soon as it is finished. On reaching the runner the puppy is given lavish praise and perhaps a reward. Generally in training the handler must know exactly where the runner went, so that he does not encourage the hound when it is wrong, or 'correct' it when it is on the scent, but he should not be too ready with his corrections if the hound goes astray, or it may come to rely on him. He should give the hound time to realise its mistake and put itself right, if possible. As training progresses the handler learns to 'read' his hound's behaviour. The hound must trust its nose and the handler must trust the hound. From early hot trails on a familiar person, the young hound progresses to colder trails on the scents of strangers. Later training can be designed to teach particular lessons: crossing trails with false scents, having the runner start out with a companion, who leaves him somewhere along the trail, laying a trail on ground frequented by wild animals. This will teach the hound not to change on to other humans, or riot on animal scents (known as 'staying clean' [US], or 'freedom from change' [UK]). It also needs to work over a variety of ground and learn to cope with distractions of many kinds, as well as being introduced to 'negative trails': given a scent article which has not been handled by anyone in the area, so that it will learn to indicate to a handler that the required scent is not there. If it is becoming discouraged it can revert to simpler tasks to recover enthusiasm.\n\n\n=== Identification ===\nCanine identification of a suspect can help police with their inquiries, and evidence of identification is accepted in some courts. The most approved method of identification is for the hound to jump up, and place its paws on the subject's chest. In the case of a lost person or a known fugitive identification will not be significant, and in the case of a potentially violent, possibly armed, fugitive a bloodhound handler will not want his dog to approach the quarry for fear of injury to the bloodhound. Many bloodhounds reaching the end of a trail will show no interest in the person they have been trailing, and are difficult to train to identify. Leon Whitney recommended a method of initial training in which identification was the first thing learned, based on giving the young hound a scent-article from someone who walks a very short distance out of sight into a barn, where he stands with a piece of liver, while another person, also smelling of liver, stands nearby. The hound is led along the 'trail', and if it shows an inclination to go to the wrong person it is chastised, but gets the liver if it goes to the right one. When the hound goes to the right person almost infallibly, the number of people is increased, making the choice more difficult, and eventually the brief walks are extended into full trails.\n\n\n=== Voice ===\nA common misconception is that Bloodhounds are employed in packs; while this is sometimes the case in Britain, where foxhound blood is mixed into them to increase speed, in North America, Bloodhounds are used as solitary trackers. When they are on a trail, they are usually silent and do not give voice as other scenthounds. The original use of the Bloodhound as a leash-hound, to find but not disturb animals, would require silent trailing.Nevertheless, the Bloodhound bay is among the most impressive of hound voices. When hunting in a pack they are expected to be in full cry. They are more likely to 'give tongue,' 'throw their tongue,' or 'speak' when hunting in a pack than when hunting singly, and more when hunting free than when on the leash. The quality of 'speaking to the line', that is giving tongue when on the correct scent while remaining silent when off it, is valued in British Bloodhound circles, on aesthetic grounds and because it makes it very easy to 'read' the hound's tracking behaviour. As a result, special trophies for speaking to the correct line are on offer at British working trials (where hounds hunt singly), although rarely awarded.\n\n\n=== Trials in Britain ===\n\nBloodhound Working Trials, first held in 1898, take place in Britain four times a year, under Kennel Club rules, organised by either the Association of Bloodhound Breeders, or The Bloodhound Club. They are run over farm land by permission of the landowners. A line-walker (runner) is given a map, and sets off to follow a course marked on it, leaving a scent-article ('smeller') attached to a flag marking the beginning of the trail. A hound and its handler start a set time later, and try to follow his trail, while the judge, equipped with a copy of the map, follows behind assessing their performance. When each of the entered hounds has completed a trail, he picks a winner. There are a series of 'stakes' of increasing difficulty, the simplest being 1 mile long, \u00bd an hour cold, and the hardest 3 miles long, 2 hours cold. On winning a stake, a hound moves up to the next one. Hounds may work unleashed if they have passed a test showing they will not bother farm stock, especially sheep. Special prizes are on offer for identification and voice ('speaking to the line'). The best hounds may be invited to take part in special stakes, the most difficult being 3 miles long, 24 hours cold.\n\n\n== Bloodhound packs ==\n\nThe Medieval Bloodhound was not primarily a pack hound, but a leash hound, though there may have been packs in different places or at different times. Up to the 19th century, a single hound or a brace was used on deer-parks, to find deer for the gun. However,  mid century two packs appeared, that of Thomas Neville, who hunted in the New Forest area, and who preferred very black hounds, and that of Lord Wolverton. Both of these hunted semi-domesticated deer ('carted deer'), which were recaptured on being brought to bay, and returned home. It was said of Lord Wolverton's hounds that he found it difficult to get them to hunt as a pack, because each liked to follow the scent on his own. Eventually, many were sold to Le Couteulx de Canteleu and taken to France.  Around the start of the 20th century, several packs existed briefly, following either deer, or the 'clean boot' \u2013 individual human scent without any enhancement such as animal blood or aniseed. Since the Second World War there have been several packs, including that of Eric Furness, who introduced a cross to a Dumfriesshire foxhound into his Peak Bloodhounds. Generally, masters of Bloodhounds since then maintain a level of outcross breeding in their packs to improve speed and agility, while retaining bloodhound type. These packs hunt the clean boot and are followed by a field on horseback.\n\n\n== Noteworthy Bloodhounds ==\nGrafton was the Bloodhound in Landseer's famous painting Dignity and Impudence[2] (1839). Both dogs in the picture belonged to Jacob Bell.Mr T A Jennings' Ch Druid, known as 'Old Druid' was the first Bloodhound champion. Born in 1857, he was later bought by Emperor Napoleon III for his son, Prince Eugene Louis Jean Joseph, and taken to France. Photographs of him, of another famous hound, Cowen's Druid, and a bitch named Countess, appear in a rare book from 1865 in the British Library[3], and may be the oldest photographs of bloodhounds to have survived.\nA Bloodhound named Nick Carter is frequently cited as the archetype of the trailing Bloodhound and the extensive publicity this dog received may be the source of much bloodhound-related folklore. Born in 1900, Nick Carter was owned and handled by Captain G.V. Mullikin of Lexington, Kentucky; he is credited with more than 650 finds, including one that required him to follow a trail 300 hours old, that is 12 days.Ch. Heathers Knock on Wood, known as Knotty, was one of the most awarded Bloodhounds of all time.He received more Best-in-Shows than any other bloodhound, and is the first liver-and-tan Bloodhound ever to win a Best-in-Show. Knotty was awarded Best-in-Show at the Eukanuba Tournament in 2005 and won the Hound Group in the Westminster Kennel Club Show the same year. Knotty's offspring have also been showdogs, and as a result many of his puppies receiving the title of \"Champion\" by the AKC, Knotty was inducted into the AKC's Stud Dog Hall of Fame. He died in the Spring of 2008, from a rattlesnake bite, which he suffered while trying to protect his owner from the snake.\nOn the popular 1960s sitcom Beverly Hillbillies, veteran canine actor Stretch portrayed Jed's Bloodhound Duke.\nThe US Army 615th Military Police Company's mascot is a Bloodhound named for the company's pet and mascot during Vietnam named Andy.\n\nBloodhound\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Fictional bloodhounds ==\nToby, a bloodhound whose assistance is requested by Sherlock Holmes in The Sign of Four.\nPluto, pet of Mickey Mouse, officially a mixed-breed dog, but designed after a pair of bloodhounds from The Chain Gang (1930)\nOl' Red, from the George Jones song of the same name (later remade by Blake Shelton)\nLadybird from King of the Hill\nBeauregard in Pogo\nPedro, the bloodhound owned and used by the English detective Sexton Blake\nHenry, a bloodhound in a popular series of British TV dog food commercials, with Clement Freud\nRex in Sofia the First\nTrusty in Lady and the Tramp and Lady and the Tramp 2\nSnuffles in Quick Draw McGraw\nNapoleon in The Aristocats\nDuke, Jed's bloodhound in The Beverly Hillbillies\nHubert in Best in Show\nBobby Lee and others in Virginia Lanier's Bloodhound series\nBuddy in Cats & Dogs\nBuster in The Fearless Four\nBruno in Cinderella and Cinderella 2\nThe Bumpuses' hounds in A Christmas Story and My Summer Story\nWoofer and Whimper in Clue Club\nMcGruff the Crime Dog\nJasper T.

This breed is a medium-sized, short-coated dog that occurs in two main colour forms. It has either brown or black hair distributed fairly evenly through a white coat, which gives the appearance of a \"red\" or \"blue\" dog. \nAs with dogs from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is energetic and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, particularly if it is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.\nIn the 19th century, New South Wales cattle farmer Thomas Hall crossed the dogs used by drovers in his parents' home county, Northumberland, with dingoes he had tamed. The resulting dogs were known as Halls Heelers. After Hall's death in 1870, the dogs became available beyond the Hall family and their associates. They were subsequently developed into two modern breeds: the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog. Robert Kaleski, who wrote the first standard for the breed, was influential in its development.\nAustralian Cattle Dog has been nicknamed a \"Red Heeler\" or \"Blue Heeler\" on the basis of its colouring and practice of moving reluctant cattle by nipping at their heels. Dogs from a line bred in Queensland, Australia, which were successful at shows and at stud in the 1940s, were called \"Queensland Heelers\" to differentiate them from lines bred in New South Wales; this nickname is now occasionally applied to any Australian Cattle Dog.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, muscular, compact dog that gives the impression of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.The Cattle Dog breed standard states that it should have well-conditioned muscles, even when bred for companion or show purposes, and that its appearance should be symmetrical and balanced, with no individual part of the dog exaggerated. It should not look either delicate or cumbersome, as either characteristic limits the agility and endurance that is necessary for a working dog.\n\n\n==== Size ====\nThe female Australian Cattle Dog measures approximately 43\u201348 centimetres (17\u201319 in) at the withers, and the male measures about 46\u201351 centimetres (18\u201320 in) at the withers. The dog should be longer than tall, that is, the length of the body from breast bone to buttocks is greater than the height at the withers, in a ratio of 10 to 9. An Australian Cattle Dog in good condition weighs around 15\u201322 kilograms (33\u201349 lb).\n\n\n==== Coat and colour ====\n\nThere are two accepted coat colours, red and blue, though chocolate and cream do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled with or without black, tan, or white markings. Red dogs are evenly speckled with solid red markings. Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration is the result of black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly white coat. This is not merle colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking gene. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of the ticking.In addition to the primary colouration, an Australian Cattle Dog displays some patches of solid or near-solid colour. In both red and blue dogs, the most common are masks over one or both eyes, a white tip to the tail, a solid spot at the base of the tail, and sometimes solid spots on the body, though these are not desirable in dogs bred for conformation shows. Blue dogs can have tan midway up the legs and extending up the front to breast and throat, with tan on jaws, and tan eyebrows. Both colour forms can have a white \"star\" on the forehead called the \"Bentley Mark\", after a legendary dog owned by Tom Bentley. Common miscolours in the Australian Cattle Dog are black hairs in a red-coated dog, including the extreme of a black saddle on a red dog, and extensive tan on the face and body on a blue dog, called \"creeping tan\". The Cattle Dog has a double coat\u2014the short, straight outer guard hairs are protective in nature, keeping the elements from the dog's skin while the undercoat is short, fine and dense.\n\nThe mask consists of a black patch over one or both eyes (for the blue coat colour) or a red patch over one or both eyes (for the red coat colour). Depending on whether one or both eyes have a patch, these are called, respectively, \"single\" (or \"half\") mask and \"double\" (or \"full\") mask. Dogs without a mask are called plain-faced. Any of these are acceptable according to the breed standard. In conformation shows, even markings are preferred over uneven markings.\n\n\n==== Tail ====\nThe breed standards of the Australian, American and Canadian kennel clubs specify that the Australian Cattle Dog should have a natural, long, un-docked tail. There will often be a solid colour spot at the base of the tail and a white tip. The tail should be set moderately low, following the slope of the back. It should hang in a slight curve at rest, though an excited dog may carry its tail higher. The tail should feature a reasonable level of brush.In the United States, tails are sometimes docked on working stock. The tail is not docked in Australia, and serves a useful purpose in increasing agility and the ability to turn quickly. The Australian Cattle Dog is a breed distinct from the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog, a square-bodied dog born with a naturally \"bobbed\" tail. The Stumpy Tail resembles the Australian Cattle Dog, but has a taller, leaner conformation. It occasionally has a natural long thin tail, but most are born without tails.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nLike many working dogs, the Australian Cattle Dog has high energy levels, an active mind, and a level of independence. The breed ranks 10th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, rated as one of the most intelligent dogs ranked by obedience command trainability. The Cattle Dog needs plenty of exercise, companionship and a job to do, so a non-working dog might participate in dog sports, learning tricks, or other activities that engage its body and mind.When on home ground, the Australian Cattle Dog is an affectionate and playful pet. However, it is reserved with people it does not know and naturally cautious in new situations. Its attitude to strangers makes it an excellent guard dog when trained for this task, and it can be socialised to become accustomed to a variety of people from an early age as a family pet. It is good with older, considerate children, but will herd people by nipping at their heels, particularly younger children who run and squeal.  By the time puppies are weaned, they should have learned that the company of people is pleasurable, and that responding to cues from a person is rewarding. The bond that this breed can create with its owner is strong and will leave the dog feeling protective towards the owner, typically resulting in the dog's never being too far from the owner's side. The Australian Cattle Dog can be the friendliest of companions although it is quick to respond to the emotions of its owners, and may defend them without waiting for a command. The ACD was originally bred to move reluctant cattle by biting, and it will bite if treated harshly. The Australian Cattle Dog's protective nature and tendency to nip at heels can be dangerous as the dog grows into an adult if unwanted behaviours are left unchecked.While an Australian Cattle Dog generally works silently, it will bark in alarm or to attract attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking can be a sign of boredom or frustration, although research has shown that pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in a noisy environment. It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a pecking order can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives in a pack with other dogs.Data accumulated from Council reports in New South Wales from April to June 2013, showed that dogs identified as Australian Cattle Dogs were involved in 66 attacks, where an attack is defined as any incident where a dog rushes at, bites, harasses or chases any person or animal. Staffordshire Bull Terrier (155 attacks), German Shepherd (89) and American Staffordshire Terrier (88) were reported to be involved in more incidents. Expressed as a percentage of registered dogs, 0.1% of Australian Cattle Dogs were involved in attacks.  The data gathered in 2011\u20132012 listed the ACD twenty-seventh in involvement in incidents ranked by percentage of dogs registered.  A review of incidents in Melbourne where a dog bit, rushed at or chased a person or animal in a public space, found that there were sixty breeds involved and the German Shepherd and German Shepherd crosses, and Australian Cattle Dog and Cattle Dog crosses accounted for 9% of incidents.  Surveys of U.S. breed club members showed that both dog-directed aggression and stranger-directed aggression were higher in the ACD than the average of breeds studied, with dog-directed aggression being the more prevalent of the two aggression types. The American Temperament Test Society reports a test pass rate of 79.3% for Australian Cattle Dogs. The average pass rate for all breeds is 80.4%.\n\n\n== As pets ==\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\nKnown as a \"wash and wear\" dog, the Australian Cattle Dog requires little grooming, and an occasional brushing is all that is required to keep the coat clean and odour-free. Even for the show ring it needs no more than wiping down with a moist cloth. It is not a year-round shedder but blows its coat once a year (twice in the case of intact females) and frequent brushing and a warm bath during this period will contain the shedding hair. As with all dogs, regular attention to nails, ears and teeth will help avoid health problems.\n\n\n=== Training ===\nIn Katherine Buetow's guide to the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar makes the point that while people think of dog training as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that it is a good idea to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.\n\n\n=== Activities ===\n\nThe Australian Cattle Dog demands a high level of physical activity. Like many other herding dog breeds, the Cattle Dog has an active and fertile mind and if it is not given jobs to do it will find its own activities. It will appreciate a walk around the neighbourhood, but it needs structured activities that engage and challenge it, and regular interaction with its owner. While individual dogs have their own personalities and abilities, as a breed the Australian Cattle Dog is suited to any activity that calls for athleticism, intelligence, and endurance.Kennel club-sponsored herding trials with a range of events suit the driving abilities of the Cattle Dog and other upright breeds, while sheepdog trials are more suited to the \"eye\" breeds such as the Border Collie and Australian Kelpie. Herding instincts and trainability are measured at non-competitive herding tests, and basic commands are sometimes taught through herding games, where rules such as \"stay\", \"get it\" and \"that'll do\" are applied to fetching a ball or chasing a yard broom.The Australian Cattle Dog was developed for its ability to encourage reluctant cattle to travel long distances and may be the best breed in the world for this work. However, some working dog trainers have expressed concern that dogs bred for the show ring are increasingly too short in the legs and too stocky in the body to undertake the work for which they were originally bred.\n\nAmong the most popular activities for an Australian Cattle Dog is dog agility. It is ideally suited for navigating obstacle courses, since as a herding dog it is reactive to the handler's body language and willing to work accurately at a distance from the handler. Agility has been used by Cattle Dog owners to instil confidence in their dogs, and enhance their performance in training and competition.The Australian Cattle Dog thrives on change and new experiences, and many handlers find training the breed challenging for this reason. An Australian Cattle Dog can excel in obedience competition. It will enjoy the challenges, such as retrieving a scented article, but the breed's problem-solving ability may lead it to find solutions to problems that are not necessarily rewarded by the obedience judges. Rally obedience offers more interaction with the owner and less repetition than traditional obedience trials.Australian Cattle Dogs have been successful in a range of dog sports including weight pulling, flyball and schutzhund. The breed is particularly suited to activities that a dog can share with its owner such as canicross, disc dog, and skijoring or bikejoring. It is an effective hiking companion because of its natural endurance, its general lack of interest in hunting, and preference for staying by its owner's side. Most Australian Cattle Dogs love the water and are excellent swimmers. It is not a hyperactive breed, and once one has had its exercise, it is happy to lie at its owner's feet, or to rest in its bed or crate while keeping an ear and eye open for signs of pending activity. The Australian Cattle Dog is an adaptable dog that can accept city or indoor living conditions, if its considerable exercise and companionship needs are met.The Australian Cattle Dog can be put to work in a number of ways. Cattle Dogs are service dogs for people with a disability or are therapy dogs, some work for customs agencies in drug detection, some as police dogs, others haze pest animals, such as geese, for city or state agencies, and some work as scat-detection dogs, tracking endangered wildlife species.\n\n\n== Health and lifespan ==\n\n\n=== Lifespan ===\nIn a small sample of 11 deceased dogs, Australian Cattle Dogs had a median longevity of 11.7 years (maximum 15.9 yrs). A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean longevity of 13.41 years with a standard deviation of 2.36 years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13 years. There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey, born in 1910 and living for 29.5 years, but the record is unverified. Even if true, Bluey's record age would have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than as an indicator of common exceptional longevity for the entire breed. It remains, however, that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class. Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14 years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing and even their teeth until their final days.\n\n\n=== Common health problems ===\n\nThe Australian Cattle Dog carries recessive piebald alleles that produce white in the coat and skin and are linked to congenital hereditary deafness, though it is possible that there is a multi-gene cause for deafness in a dog with the piebald pigment genes. Around 2.4% of Cattle Dogs in one study were found to be deaf in both ears and 14.5% were deaf in at least one ear.The Australian Cattle Dog is one of the dog breeds affected by progressive retinal atrophy. It has the most common form, progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), a condition that causes the rods and cones in the retina of the eye to deteriorate later in life, resulting in blindness. PRCD is an autosomal recessive trait and a dog can be a carrier of the affected gene without developing the condition.Hip dysplasia is not common in the breed, although it occurs sufficiently often for many breeders to have their breeding stock tested. The Cattle Dog has a number of inherited conditions, but most of these are not common. Hereditary polioencephalomyelopathy of the Australian Cattle Dog is a very rare condition caused by an inherited biochemical defect. Dogs identified with the condition were completely paralysed within their first year. Based on a sample of 69 still-living dogs, the most common health issues noted by owners were musculoskeletal (spondylosis, elbow dysplasia, and arthritis) and reproductive (pyometra, infertility, and false pregnancy), and blindness. A study of dogs diagnosed at Veterinary Colleges in the United States and Canada over a thirty-year period described fractures, lameness and cruciate ligament tears as the most common conditions in the Australian Cattle Dogs treated.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== In Australia ===\n\nGeorge Hall and his family arrived in the New South Wales Colony in 1802. By 1825, the Halls had established two cattle stations in the Upper Hunter Valley, and had begun a northward expansion into the Liverpool Plains, New England and Queensland. Getting his cattle to the Sydney markets presented a problem in that thousands of head of cattle had to be moved for thousands of kilometres along unfenced stock routes through sometimes rugged bush and mountain ranges. A note, in his own writing, records Thomas Hall's anger at losing 200 head in scrub.A droving dog was needed, but the colonial working dogs are understood to have been of the Old English Sheepdog type, commonly referred to as Smithfields. Descendants of these dogs still exist, but are useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in Northumberland, his parents' home county. At that time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they constituted a breed as it is currently understood. In the manner of the time, the Hall family historian, A. J. Howard, gave these blue mottled dogs a name: Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.Thomas Hall crossed his Drovers Dogs with dingoes he had tamed, and by 1840 was satisfied with his resulting progeny. During the next thirty years, the Halls Heelers, as they became known, were used only by the Halls. Given that they were dependent on the dogs, which gave them an advantage over other cattle breeders, it is understandable that the dogs were not distributed beyond the Hall's properties. It was not until after Thomas Hall's death in 1870, when the properties went to auction with the stock on them, that Halls Heelers became freely available.\n\nBy the 1890s, the dogs had attracted the attention of the Cattle Dog Club of Sydney, a group of men with a recreational interest in the new practice of showing dogs competitively. None were stockmen working cattle on a daily basis, and initially they were interested in a range of working dogs, including the Smithfield. They reportedly adopted the term \"Australian Cattle Dog\" to refer to the dogs being bred from bloodlines originating from Thomas Hall's \"heelers\", and prominent members of the group concentrated on breeding these lines. Of these breeders, the Bagust family was the most influential. Robert Kaleski, of Moorebank, a young associate of Harry Bagust, wrote \"in 1893 when I got rid of my cross-bred cattle dogs and took up the blues, breeders of the latter had started breeding ... to fix the type. I drew up a standard for them on those lines\". This first breed standard for the Cattle Dog breed was published, with photographs, by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in 1903.Kaleski's standard was adopted by breed clubs in Queensland and New South Wales and re-issued as their own, with local changes. His writings from the 1910s give an important insight into the early history of the breed. However, dog breeder and author Noreen Clark has noted that his opinions are sometimes just that, and he introduces some contradictory assertions in his later writings, as well as some assumptions that are illogical in the light of modern science. Some of these have persisted; for example he saw the red colour form as having more dingo in it than the blue form, and there is a persistent belief that reds are more vicious than blues. The most enduring of Kaleski's myths relate to Dalmatian and Kelpie infusions into the early Cattle Dog breed. These infusions are not referred to in Kaleski's writings until the 1920s and it seems likely that Kaleski sought to explain the Cattle Dog's mottled colouration and tan on legs by similarity to the Dalmatian and Kelpie, respectively. The genetics of coat colour, and the current understanding of hereditary characteristics, make the infusion of Dalmatian to increase the cattle dog's tolerance of horses an extremely unlikely event. There were relatively few motor vehicles in Australia at the beginning of the 20th century, so most dogs of any breed would have been accustomed to horses. The Kelpie breed was developed after the Cattle Dog type was described, so its infusion is unlikely. It is possible that there was some infusion of Bull Terrier but there is no verifiable record of this, and the Cattle Dog has not had the Bull Terrier's instinct to bite and hold, which would have been an undesirable trait. Early in the 1900s there was considerable in-fighting amongst members of the Cattle Dog Club, and a series of arguments about the origin of the breed appeared in newspapers and journals of the time. While many of these arguments were misleading, some irrational, and the majority not supported by historical facts, they continue to be circulated, resulting in a number of theories on the origins of the breed. In recent years, information technology enabling the manipulation of large databases combined with advances in the understanding of canine genetics has allowed a clearer understanding of the development of the breed.\n\nThrough the 1890s, Cattle Dogs of Halls Heeler derivations were seen in the kennels of exhibiting Queensland dog breeders such as William Byrne of Booval, and these were a different population from those shown in New South Wales. Little Logic was bred in Rockdale, New South Wales, however Sydney exhibitors saw Little Logic for the first time after the dog had been added to the Hillview kennels of Arch Bevis in Brisbane. The show records of Little Logic and his offspring created a demand in New South Wales for Queensland dogs. By the end of the 1950s, there were few Australian Cattle Dogs whelped that were not descendants of Little Logic and his best known son, Logic Return. The success and popularity of these dogs led to the growth of the nickname \"Queensland Heeler\".The prominence of Little Logic and Logic Return in the pedigrees of modern Australian Cattle Dogs was perpetuated by Wooleston Kennels. For some twenty years, Wooleston supplied foundation and supplementary breeding stock to breeders in Australia, North America and Continental Europe. As a result, Wooleston Blue Jack is ancestral to most, if not all, Australian Cattle Dogs whelped since 1990 in any country.\n\n\n=== In the United States ===\n\nIn the 1940s Alan McNiven, a Sydney veterinarian, introduced Dingo, Kelpie, German Shepherd, and Kangaroo Hound into his breeding program; however, the Royal Agricultural Society Kennel Club (RASKC) would not register the cross breeds as Australian Cattle Dogs, even though McNiven argued they were true to conformation, colour and temperament. McNiven responded by giving his pups registration papers from dead dogs, and was consequently expelled from the RASKC and all of his dogs removed from the registry. Meanwhile, Greg Lougher, a Napa, California cattle rancher who met Alan McNiven while stationed in Australia during World War II, had imported several adults and several litters from McNiven. After his de-registration McNiven continued to export his \"improved\" dogs to the United States. Many U.S. soldiers who were stationed in Queensland or NSW during the War discovered the Australian Cattle Dog and took one home when they returned.In the late 1950s a veterinarian in Santa Rosa, California, Jack Woolsey, was introduced to Lougher's dogs. With his partners, he bought several dogs and started breeding them. The breeders advertised the dogs in Western Horsemen stating they were guaranteed to work and calling them Queensland Heelers. Woolsey imported several purebred Australian Cattle Dogs to add to his breeding program, including Oaklea Blue Ace, Glen Iris Boomerang and several Glen Iris bitches. The National Stock Dog Registry of Butler, Indiana, registered the breed, assigning American numbers without reference to Australian registrations.Australian Cattle Dogs had been classified in the \"miscellaneous\" category at the American Kennel Club (AKC) since the 1930s; to get the breed full recognition, the AKC required that a National Breed Parent Club be organised for promotion and protection of the breed. In 1967 Esther Ekman met Chris Smith-Risk at an AKC show, and the two fell into conversation about their Australian Cattle Dogs and the process of establishing a parent club for the breed. By 1969 the fledgling club had 12 members and formally applied to the AKC for instructions. One of the requirements was that the Club had to start keeping its own registry for the breed and that all dogs on the registry would have to be an extension of the Australian registry, tracing back to registered dogs in Australia. The AKC Parent Club members began researching their dogs, including exchanging correspondence with McNiven, and discovered that few of them had dogs that could be traced back to dogs registered in Australia. The AKC took over the club registry in 1979 and the breed was fully recognised in September 1980. The Australian Cattle Dog Club of America is still active in the promotion of the breed and the maintenance of breed standards. The National Stock Dog Registry continued to recognise Cattle Dogs without prerequisite links to Australian registered dogs, on the condition that any dog of unknown parentage that was presented for registry would be registered as an \"American Cattle Dog\", and all others would still be registered as \"Australian Cattle Dogs\".\n\n\n=== In Canada ===\nThe breed gained official recognition from the Canadian Kennel Club in January 1980 after five years of collecting pedigrees, gathering support, and lobbying officials by two breeders and enthusiasts. The small number of Australian Cattle Dogs in Canada at the time were primarily working dogs on farms and ranches scattered across large distances. However, the fledgling breed club held conformation shows, obedience and agility competitions, and entered their dogs in sports including flyball and lure coursing. At the end of 1980, Landmaster Carina was named the first Australian Cattle Dog in Canada to gain both her conformation and obedience titles.\n\n\n=== In the United Kingdom ===\nThe first registered Australian Cattle Dogs to arrive in the United Kingdom were two blue puppies, Lenthal Flinton and Lenthal Darlot, followed in 1980 by Landmaster Darling Red in whelp. Landmaster Darling Red was imported by John and Mary Holmes, and proved to be an outstanding brood bitch. Over the next few years additional Cattle Dogs arrived in the UK from the Netherlands, Kenya, Germany and Australia, although prior to relaxation of rules regarding artificial insemination, the UK gene pool was limited. In 1985 an Australian Cattle Dog Society was formed and officially recognised by the Kennel Club; before this they had to compete in the category \"Any Variety Not Separately Classified\". Australian Cattle Dogs were competing successfully in obedience and working trials in the UK during the 1980s.\n\n\n== Cross breeds ==\nThe Texas Heeler is a cross between the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd that was first registered with the Animal Research Foundation (ARF) in 1970. The ARF has registered Australian Cattle Dogs without papers as \"Australian Cattledog Queensland Heelers\" since 1965 and was the first organisation to recognise the Australian Shepherd. Although originally bred for its ability to work cattle, the Texas Heeler is increasingly used as a pet and a companion in dog sports. As with most cross breeds, the Texas Heeler's size and appearance is a variable combination of the parent breeds.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nAustralian Cattle Dog at Curlie"}, {"id": 79, "name": "Blue Lacy", "country": "United States", "type": "", "picture": "dog79", "description": "The Lacy Dog or Blue Lacy Dog is a breed of working dog that originated in Texas in the mid-19th century. The Lacy was first recognized in 2001 by the Texas Senate. In Senate Resolution No. 436, the 77th Legislature honored the Lacy as \"a true Texas breed\". In June 2005, Governor Rick Perry signed the legislation adopting the Blue Lacy as \"the official State Dog Breed of Texas\". As expected, the vast majority of Lacy dogs are found in Texas. However, as the breed becomes more well recognized, there are breeding populations being established across the United States, Canada, and most recently in Europe.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nLacy dogs are strong and fast, lightly built but proportional within the height-to-weight ratio. Height at the withers is from 43 to 56 cm (17 to 22 in). Dependent on height and general conditioning, weight should be approximately 11 to 20 kg (25 to 45 lb) for females and 16 to 25 kg (35 to 55 lb) for males. The standards listed in the Texas House Concurrent Resolution No. 108 are slightly different: height between 46 to 64 cm (18 to 25 in), weight between 14 to 23 kg (30 to 50 lb) but it was not until 2005 that it was officially recognized as the state dog.\n\n\n=== Color ===\nThough they are often called \"blue\" Lacys, there are three permissible color varieties of the Lacy. \"Blues\" are any shade of gray from light silver to dark charcoal. \"Reds\" range from light cream to rust. The \"Tri\" combines a blue base with distinct red markings as appropriate for trim, and white which may appear on the brisket and stretch from chin to groin. White may also be present on one or more paws. Excessive white is discouraged, and markings on the face or above mid-line are a disqualifying fault. Their eyes are sharp and alert, ranging in color from bright yellow to rich amber.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nThe coat should be short, smooth and tight. An excessively long or rough coat is a disqualification. Lacys shed, but require minimal grooming.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n \nBlue Lacy Dogs in general are intelligent, intense, active, and alert. Developed to be both hunting and herding dogs, they display great drive and determination to work with big game and control difficult livestock. Young dogs may have too much energy and drive for small children. They are easy to train, learning new skills quickly.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe Lacy is a working breed, and does much better when given a job, which allows them to burn off excessive energy. Work they excel at includes herding livestock, blood trailing or tracking, treeing game, running trap lines, and hunting wild hogs. \nModern activities like agility that stress intelligence, passion, speed and nimbleness may be appropriate substitutes for traditional work. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Lacys generally exhibit herding instincts and can be trained to compete in stock dog trials or hog bays. During recent years, Lacy dogs have also become recognized for their great tracking skills, and sought after to be used to locate \"lost\" game animals. Besides, they're used by United States trappers for save and chasing operation.\n\n\n== Health ==\nLacys are generally very healthy dogs. Developed for generations to meet the requirements of ranchers and hunters, they are sturdy enough to withstand tough terrain, difficult working conditions, and both hot and cold weather by Texan standards. However, skin problems and food allergies can occur. Color dilution alopecia is very rare but has occurred in Lacys.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Lacy dog was named after the Lacy brothers (Frank, George, Ewin, and Harry Lacy) who moved from Kentucky to Texas in 1858, settling in Burnet County, Texas. The dog, according to the Lacy family, was a mixture of English Shepherd (or perhaps coyote), greyhound, and wolf. Texas House Concurrent Resolution No. 108 also mentions scenthound. The brothers originally developed the dogs' natural herding instincts to work the family's free-roaming hogs.On March 15, 2005, in the 79th Legislature of the State of Texas, Representative Joaquin Castro at the request of the Texas Lacy Game Dog Association filed House Concurrent Resolution No. 108, proposing the blue Lacy as state dog of Texas.  This legislation was proposed to recognize the original breeders and their contribution to the State of Texas as well as to honor the Lacy as a Texas original.  House Concurrent Resolution No. 108 was adopted by the Texas House of Representatives on May 15, 2005, and by the Senate ten days later on May 25, 2005.  Governor Rick Perry signed the legislation adopting the Lacy as \"the official State Dog Breed of Texas\" on June 18, 2005.The Lacy was proposed by some in 2008 to replace Reveille VII, a collie, as the mascot dog of Texas A&M. In accordance with tradition since Reveille III, however, a collie was chosen.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBlue Lacy at Curlie"}, {"id": 80, "name": "Blue Paul Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom, Scotland", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog80", "description": "The Blue Paul Terrier, also known as the Blue Poll, was a Scottish breed of dog that is now extinct.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Blue Paul Terrier's origins are disputed but it was once numerous in various parts of Scotland. One story of the Blue Paul Terrier's origins is that John Paul Jones brought them from abroad and when he visited his native town of Kirkcudbright around 1770.  The gypsies around the Kirkintilloch district kept Blue Paul Terriers for dog fighting, and they claimed the dogs came from the Galloway coast.  A more likely story is a British military officer posted to the Glasgow area brought with him an Irish Blue Terrier bitch from the Earl of Kerry's kennels, when he was reposted he left his bitch with friends who bred her with a white bull and terrier of the Duke of Hamilton's breeding to create the breed.  Another story states the breed descend from a bitch named Blue Poll from a village near Newcastle, and that a visiting Scotsman purchased several of her pups and returned with them to his homeland.The Blue Paul Terrier was clearly a bull and terrier cross that was most likely bred from bulldogs and terriers in Scotland with infusions other similar dogs brought from England and Ireland.  The breed was very popular in Scotland in the mid 19th century, but it progressively lost popularity and is believed to have become extinct in the early 20th century.In the mid-19th century, the breed was among the first dogs to arrive in the United States with British immigrants, along with the bull and terrier.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Blue Paul Terrier weighed around 45 lb (20 kg), sources vary about its height, some state it stood around 14 in (36 cm) at the shoulder, others as tall as 20 in (51 cm).  The breed resembled early bull terriers.The Blue Paul Terrier's head was large, its  forehead was flat, short, square and broad but not receding like that of the bulldog, its jaws and teeth were even with no overhanging flews. They had a slight dip between the eyes, which were dark hazel and not sunken,  prominent, nor showing haw, its eyebrows were contracted or knit.  The ears were small, thin, high set and usually cropped, and the face was not wrinkled.  The facial expression of the Blue Paul Terrier has never been seen in any other breed, although it is frequently recognised in some mixed-breed dogs.The Blue Paul Terrier was powerfully built, its body was round and well ribbed, its back was short, broad and muscular but not roached, and its chest deep and wide. The tail was set low and devoid of fringe, rather drooping and never rising above the back.  The Blue Paul Terrier stood straight and firmly on its legs, its forelegs were stout and muscular, showing no curve whilst its hind legs were very thick and strong, with well-developed muscles.The Blue Paul Terrier had a smooth coat, the usual colour was dark blue, similar to some Greyhounds, however  some were brindle or red, known as red smuts.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Blue Paul Terrier was known for its courage and strength, it was said to be game to the death and could suffer great punishment, when fighting they were considered expert and tricky in their tactics, making them great favorites with those who indulged in dog fighting.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nDue to its fighting skills, in the early 19th century the Blue Paul Terrier was a foundational breed in the development of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, its blue colouring can still be seen in that breed. The Blue Paul Terrier also influenced the development of the American Pit Bull Terrier and the American Staffordshire Terrier.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMolosser dogs, \"Scottish Blue Paul Bullterrier\", molosserdogs.com, retrieved 7 May 18."}, {"id": 81, "name": "Blue Picardy Spaniel", "country": "France", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog81", "description": "The Blue Picardy Spaniel (or \u00c9pagneul Bleu de Picardie) is a breed of Spaniel originating in France, from the area around the mouth of the River Somme, around the start of the 20th century. It is descended from Picardy Spaniels and English Setters, and is described as a quiet breed that requires much exercise due to its stamina. It is especially good with children. Similar to the Picardy Spaniel, it has a distinctive coloured coat. Recognised by only a handful of kennel associations, the breed is predominantly known in France and Canada.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nA Blue Picardy Spaniel on average is around 22\u201324 inches (56\u201361 cm) high at the withers and weighs 43\u201345 pounds (20\u201320 kg). Its coat is speckled grey black forming a bluish shade, with some black patches. The coat is flat or a little wavy with feathering on the ears, legs, underside and tail. It has long legs with some setter characteristics.It has a long broad nose and muzzle, with thick ears covered in silky hair that usually end around the tip of the muzzle. Its chest is of medium size that descends down to the same level as the elbows. Both the forequarters and the hindquarters are well muscled. Its tail typically does not extend beyond the hock and is normally straight.The breed has many similarities with the Picardy Spaniel due to the two breeds' recent history. The Blue Spaniel is described as being softer, as well as the obvious difference in coat color. The Picardy has a brown coat whereas the Blue Picardy has a black and grey coat, which was brought into the breed by the introduction of English Setter blood. Similar in the modern era due to the close similarities of the two different breed standards. In addition, the Blue Picardy is a little faster, and has a slightly finer nose.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nIt is a versatile hunting dog, used for its ability to locate and retrieve game in harsh and adverse terrain and conditions. It is not specialised to any one type of terrain, and tends to score well in field trials. The Blue Picardy is considered to be a quiet breed, but requires a great deal of exercise as it has a high level of stamina. It loves to play, and is a responsive and obedient breed which thrives on human companionship. It is especially good with children.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThe breed has no known genetic health issues. Blue Picardy Spaniels can be prone to ear infections, which are common among dogs with pendulous ears, including Basset Hounds and other breeds of Spaniel. It has an average life expectancy of thirteen years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first French Spaniel is speculated to have appeared following the Crusades of the 11th century, and it was these breeds of dogs that were described in Gaston III of Foix-B\u00e9arn's 14th-century work Livre de Chasse. Following the French Revolution the commoners in France were allowed to raise and keep their own hunting dogs. This in turn meant that the pre-existing French Spaniel split into several types specific to their own regions, which were classified according to physical appearance and hunting abilities.At the turn of the 20th century the area around the mouth of the River Somme was considered a paradise for hunters interested in wildfowl. Because of quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom, British shooters would board their dogs in the Picardy area, near the mouth of the Somme. This caused the infusion of English Setter blood into the local Spaniel population and developed the Blue Picardy Spaniel.While the first black, blue-grey Spaniel was recorded in 1875, it was not until 1904 when the Picardy Spaniel was first shown. This Spaniel was officially classified as a French Spaniel, and was shown at the Paris Canine Exposition. When the Picard Spaniel and Blue Picardy Spaniel Club was formed in 1907 the two different breeds of Picardy Spaniel were categorised.In France, the Blue Picardy was recognised as a separate breed in 1938, and there are about 1000 puppies born in France each year. The first person to import the Blue Picardy Spaniel into Canada was Ronald Meunier of Saint-Julien, Quebec, around 1987, and the breed was then recognised by the Canadian Kennel Club effective 1 June 1995. The breed is recognised by the American Rare Breed Association, which uses the same standard as the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEspagneuls Picards, Bleus de Picardie & Pont Audemer Club (In French)\nNederlandse Vereniging Epagneul Bleu de Picardie (In Dutch)"}, {"id": 82, "name": "Bluetick Coonhound", "country": "United States", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog82", "description": "The Bluetick Coonhound is a breed of Coonhound originating in the United States. The Bluetick Coonhound is known for its friendly persona, cold nose and deep bawl mouth. It is most commonly used as a raccoon hunting dog, but may also be kept as a pet.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe overall build of the Bluetick Coonhound is muscular and speedy.  The head is carried up and the tail carried over the back, without signs of fear or nervousness.  The Bluetick coat should be moderately coarse and glossy.  The Bluetick Coonhound gets its \"blue\" coloring from black ticking on a white background, which gives the impression of a navy blue color.  This ticking covers the body and can be interspersed with variously-shaped black spots on the back, ears and sides. Preference runs to more blue than black on the body. Black should predominate on the head and ears. Bluetick Coonhounds should have tan dots over the eyes and the sides of the muzzle will be tan. There is generally a ticked blaze running up the face. Bluetick Coonhounds should be 21 inches to 27 inches tall at the shoulder and males weigh approximately 55 to 80 pounds (25 to 36 kg).  Females are considerably smaller at an average weight of 45 to 65 pounds. Feet should be cat-like, rounded with well-arched toes. Their paws are larger than those of nearly all other breeds of dogs. Rear legs should have a moderate bend at the hocks.  All legs should be straight from the dog's body to the ground when viewed from the front or rear.\nGascon blues are larger than standard Blueticks, with males a minimum of 27 inches and a maximum of 30 inches, per the American Blue Gascon Hound Association's breed standard.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nBluetick Coonhounds are bred to be hunting dogs. They are athletic, hardy, and need a full-time job or activity such as hunting, obedience, or agility to stay happy. They can be challenging to train and they should be monitored around cats or other small animals. They are, like their hound counterparts, a very intelligent breed that has the uncanny talent for problem-solving.\nOnce trained, the members of the breed are very mindful of their owner. Something first time pet owners should be aware of is the daunting task of \"voice-training\" these dogs. Being bred to bay while hunting, they are highly vocal. If properly socialized from a young age, they can be family pets.\nIn normal conditions, the Bluetick Coonhound gets along well with children. They are mindful and friendly dogs. However, their noses will keep them in trouble, so food and garbage should never be left out unattended. The breed is often mistaken for being aggressive as the breed will \"greet\" strangers with its signature howl and will sniff the subject until satisfied. Usually, this is just the way the breed gets to know its subjects. Since Blueticks are driven by their strong sense of smell, they make excellent hunting/tracking dogs. If allowed, they will tree almost any animal smaller than them. Blueticks are generally easier to handle in the field than some other coonhounds.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Bluetick Coonhound, which originated in Louisiana, was developed from the Bleu de Gascogne hound of southwest France, as well as the English Foxhound, the cur dog, the American Foxhound, and the Black And Tan Virginia Foxhound.  Originally, Bluetick Coonhounds were registered in the United Kennel Club under the English Foxhound and Coonhound, but were recognized by the club as a separate breed in 1946.  Bluetick Coonhounds are also recognized by the Australian National Kennel Council and the New Zealand Kennel Club.  In April 2009 the breed was accepted by the American Kennel Club and in December 2009 they became eligible to compete in AKC coonhound events. The American Blue Gascon Hound is a subgroup of Bluetick Coonhounds that is larger, heavier and more \"houndy\" looking than the standard Bluetick. American Blue Gascon Hounds are often referred to as \"old-fashioned\" Blueticks. This is due to their appearance and \"colder\" nose, or slower style of tracking, compared to other modern coonhound breeds.\n\n\n== Famous Bluetick Coonhounds ==\nSmokey, the mascot of the University of Tennessee, is a Bluetick.\nA Bluetick Coonhound named Tet was the companion of Stringfellow Hawke, the main character of the popular 1980s television show Airwolf.\nOld Blue, a Bluetick Coonhound, was in the 1960 Elia Kazan film, Wild River.\nOld Blue was a Bluetick Coonhound belonging to the Pritchard boys in the novel Where the Red Fern Grows by Wilson Rawls.\nA female Bluetick Coonhound is in the George Jones song \"Ol' Red\" which was later covered by Blake Shelton.\nHuckleberry Hound is a Bluetick.\nSavage Sam, the sequel to Old Yeller, is about a Bluetick Coonhound.\nLillian's dog, Gideon, is a Bluetick Coonhound in the song \"Red Dirt Girl\" written by Emmylou Harris.\nA Bluetick Coonhound is referenced in the song \"Long Haired Country Boy\" written by Charlie Daniels.\nA Bluetick hound is referred to in the 2016 song \"Church Bells,\" written by Zach Crowell, Brett James and Hillary Lindsey, and sung by Carrie Underwood.\nA Bluetick hound named Nash is mentioned in the song \"Sun Shines on a Dreamer\" by Wade Bowen.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBluetick Coonhound Breeders of America\nAmerican Blue Gascon Hounds Association"}, {"id": 83, "name": "Boerboel", "country": "South Africa", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog83", "description": "The Boerboel [\u02c8bu\u02d0rbul], also known as the South African Mastiff, is a large, Molosser-type breed from South Africa and are bred for the purpose of guarding the homestead.

Boerboel, therefore, translates as either \"farmer's dog\" or \"Boer's dog\" and should be pronounced somewhat like \"boo-r-bull.\" (not Burbull). The Boerboel is the only South African dog breed created to defend the homestead.\nDespite the Boerboel's long breeding history, there is great uncertainty as to how many and which breeds were used to create it. It is generally believed that the breed was created from interbreeding native African landrace dogs, such as the Africanis, with breeds brought into South Africa by Dutch, French, and British settlers.\nThe most likely origins date back to Jan van Riebeeck's arrival to the Cape in 1652. Van Riebeeck brought a \"Bullenbijter\" with him. Those originals settlers, and later European settlers, also had large, strong dogs that almost certainly bred with the indigenous, domestic dog breeds of South Africa.In the early 1860s, when military posts were scattered across the South African frontier, bloodhounds, staghounds, greyhounds, bulldogs, terriers, mastiffs, pointers, and occasionally foxhounds were to be found at each post. The Boer dog was a cross between these breeds. It was generally in the vicinity of military posts where the best Boer dogs were to be found. In addition, the best dogs for hunting leopards and baboons were a cross between a mastiff and a bulldog.Later, in 1928, the diamond mining company De Beers imported Bullmastiffs to South Africa to guard the mines. This breed was also crossbred with Boerboels in the region.\n\n\n=== Boerboels today ===\n\nThe Boerboel was first introduced to purebred enthusiasts throughout the world, including the United States, by the American anthropologist Dr. Carl Semencic, first in an article in Dog World Magazine and later in his book entitled Gladiator Dogs which was first published by T.F.H. Publications in 1998 and later republished by another publisher in 2013. Semencic credits his early familiarity with the breed to his own travels to South Africa, but especially to his frequent correspondence with the head of the first South African Boerboel club, one Mr. Kobus Rust.  Later, the Boerboel Breeders Association was established in 1983 in the Senekal district of the Free State with the sole objective of ennobling and promoting the Boerboel as a unique South African dog breed.\nToday, Boerboel breeding is both a hobby and an industry in South Africa. These dogs are now exported from South Africa to other parts of the world.\nThe protective character of the Boerboel is still evident and is much sought after, as is the calm, stable, and confident composure of the breed. The dogs are obedient and intelligent and have strong territorial instincts. The Boerboel remains the guarding breed of choice amongst current day farmers and is very popular for the same reason in urban communities.The name Boerboel is commonly misspelled as boerbul, boerbull, and borbull.The Boerboel is a very powerful breed of dog. Due to its use as a farm dog which brought it into conflict with large African predators such as lions, the Boerboel has been artificially selected for ability to protect themselves and others.\nThere is also a divergence of standards. The Kennel Union of South Africa does not accept the black coat but SABBS does, so a buyer needs to decide what standard to follow, as a dog that has a black coat, or is the descendant of a dog with a black coat, they cannot be registered with AKC,UKC,or BI.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Boerboel is a large dog, with a strong bone structure and well developed muscles. The head appears blocky, but not overdone, with a short length between the stop and nose. \nIt should look impressive, carrying himself with confidence and powerful movement, which should be buoyant, and unencumbered, despite its size.\nIt should be symmetrical and balanced, following the desired proportions for the breed.\nMales should be markedly bigger than females, there is a distinct sexual dimorphism, with the female less prominently developed physically.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nThe Boerboel is a below average shedder and easy to groom.  The occasional brushing and a monthly bath and nail trim is all that is needed.  The breed has an outer coat that is normally coarse and straight, and an undercoat that is soft and dense.Its coat is short, dense, smooth, soft, and shiny.  The coat color can be various shades of red, brown, brindle,</ref>https://images.akc.org/pdf/breeds/standards/Boerboel.pdf</ref>or fawn. Many dogs have a black mask around their mouth that sometimes extends to their eyes and ears.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nBoerboels are an intelligent and energetic breed. They are loyal, great with children, and tend to be protective of their family and territory.They are quite charming when not being lazy, and will not hesitate to defend their loved ones to the death.They are often called \"Velcro\" dogs, always wanting to be with their owners, and so, are not prone to wandering off on their own.\nThe Boerboel also requires training and firm handling from an early age.\n It is not unusual for this breed to display aggression toward other dogs or strangers.\n\n\n== Health ==\nBoerboels are generally known for their good health.  However, Boerboels can suffer from hip or elbow dysplasia, vaginal hyperplasia, ectropion, and entropion.\nRecently, juvenile epilepsy (with attacks brought on by metabolic changes or stress) has appeared in the boerboel breed.\nA boerboel's behavior and comportment may change over time.   The average life expectancy is ten years.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nProspective owners must recognize that owning a Boerboel requires a significant commitment in time and energy as they need to be trained and properly socialized in order to be happy, well-adjusted family members.These dogs thrive under positive reinforcement training techniques and require human companionship and structure. If left isolated, Boerboels will digress and may become destructive. Owners should be wary of trying to forcefully control the dog as it is detrimental to their psychological health and could cause potential behavioral backlash in the future. These dogs benefit from an owner who respects their size and strength but is not fearful of it.\nAlthough more suitable for large yards, Boerboels are adaptable but will struggle living in small environments as long as they receive regular exercise and a lot of attention. Whatever the amount of space available, they need to have plenty of physical and mental exercise. The Boerboel can be exercised in a large, securely enclosed yard, but at a minimum this type of dog needs to be taken on a long walk every day.  According to the SABBS it is the owner's responsibility to keep the dog safe, properly controlled and supervised in public, or when around children or people it is not familiar with. It is also important to note that the boerboel was bred to tackle large animals like lions and baboons, so strict training should be incorporated to avoid aggression \n\n\n== Restrictions ==\nIn 2002, Romania prohibited the import of the Boerboel, and restricted ownership to those with a court order allowing them to own the dog.In 2010, the Boerboel was banned in Denmark for being suspected as a fighting dog.In 2011, Russia designated the Boerboel an \"especially dangerous breed,\" subject to mandatory registration and certification.Ukraine has classified the Boerboel as a dangerous dog, subject to mandatory microchipping, muzzle, and civil liability insurance.The Boerboel is also banned or prohibited in:\n\nFrance\nFairfield, Iowa\nMalaysia\nQatar\nGeneva, Switzerland\nMauritius\nBermudaImportation of the Boerboel is illegal/banned in:\n\nSingapore\u2014currently existing dogs must have insurance in the amount of not less than $100,000, sterilization, microchipping, and muzzle.\nDenmark\u2014currently existing dogs must be muzzled and leashed at all times in public.\nRomania\u2014owners must be at least 18 years of  age, and be certified psychologically fit to own a dog of this breed.\nTunisia \nFaroe Islands \nTurks and Caicos\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnimal Socialization\nBoerboel International\nF\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale\nGuard dog\nKennel Union of South Africa\nMolosser\nObedience training\nHistory of South Africa \u2013 Colonization (1652\u20131815)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAmerican Boerboel Club Official Website\nDogmal Official Website\n\nBOERBOEL OWNERS GROUP http://www.boerboelowners.com"}, {"id": 84, "name": "Bohemian Shepherd", "country": "Czech Republic", "type": "", "picture": "dog84", "description": "The Bohemian Shepherd is a breed of dog also known as the Chodsk\u00fd pes or the Chodenhund. The Bohemian Shepherd is recognized nationally in Czech Republic but is not recognized by the FCI or any other major kennel club.\n\n\n== History ==\nChodsk\u00fd pes is an old sheepdog breed. They have been also guarding Bohemian southwestern borders and homes in the area of the Chod region (around Doma\u017elice town). \"Chodov\u00e9\" (the Chods), the local people living there, had an exceptional permission to hold large dogs for this purpose. Alois Jir\u00e1sek, writing about a brave uprising of the local people, even assigned these dogs as a flag symbol of them. Though that is actually incorrect, the symbol became part of national knowledge due to drawings of a well known Czech painter Mikol\u00e1\u0161 Ale\u0161. The symbol of the Chodsk\u00fd pes is still on Czech young scouts badges.\nAs the breed of chodsk\u00fd pes is old, it is possibly also one of the predecessors to the German Shepherd. Chodsk\u00fd pes is known to have existed in the Czech lands as far back as the 14th century, and having been professionally bred as early as the 16th century, centuries before the Germans decided to try to make their own national breed. A modern breeding program for this dog was started in 1984 and there are now many breeders. About 3500 registered pups have been born since the program started (1984\u20132009). Therefore, there is no proof that they are related to German Shepherds.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Bohemian Shepherd has a medium size and length (48-55 cm (19 to 22 inches) in height and weigh about  15-25 kg (35-55 lbs)). Long thick fur and a rich undercoat that allows him to survive in harsh weathers. The body is compact and well proportioned with High set, small, pointed, erect ears and a long elegant neckline. A fluid, light and unhurried gait is one of the typical characteristics of this breed.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThis is an ideal dog for someone who is very active, this breed has lots of energy, is not aggressive, can be easily trained, and is excellent with children and other pets. Its great agility and a keen sense of smell make it a very good rescue dog, a great companion for handicapped people and an outstanding watch dog. This breed has a stable, calm and friendly temperament that allows it to be good with the owner, his family and specially with children.\n\n\n== External links =="}, {"id": 85, "name": "Bolognese (dog)", "country": "Italy", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog85", "description": "The Bolognese (pronounced [bolo\u0272\u02c8\u0272e\u02d0ze; -e\u02d0se]) is a small breed of dog of the bichon type, originating in Italy. The name refers to the central North  Italian city of Bologna. It is part of the Toy dog group and is considered a companion dog. They love attention, and make good house pets. They are good at socializing with other dogs, big and small. They have a strong bond with the person/s with whom they spend the most time.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Bolognese is a small, white, compact dog with a distinctive white single coat. It is of small size, stocky and compact. It is of square build and well-muscled. The head is of medium length. The skull is slightly ovoid. The muzzle is large, black and almost square. It has a developed jaw and the upper lips don\u2019t cover the bottom lips. Its lips are black. It has white, strong and evenly aligned teeth. Its eyes are well developed, open and round. The rims of the eyelids are black and the iris is a dark ochre color. The ears are set high and are long and hanging but rigid at the base. The tail is carried curved over the back.The Bolognese's height varies 10.5 to 12 inches for a male and 10-11 inches for a female. The weight varies between 6 and 14 lbs.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nThe distinctive single coat (i.e. no undercoat) falls in loose open ringlets/flocks all over the body, with shorter hair on the face. The hair's texture is woolly, as opposed to silky, and is never trimmed or clipped unless kept as pets. The hair sheds very little, but requires regular combing to prevent matting.\nThe Bolognese often appears on lists of dogs that allegedly do not shed (moult). It is true that these dogs do not seasonally moult or lose large amounts of fur as many other breeds do. However, they do eventually lose and replace individual hairs, similar to human hair growth cycles. Each hair grows from a hair follicle, which has a three phase cycle, as do most mammals. These cycles are: anagen, growth of normal hair; catagen growth slows, and hair shaft thins; telegen, hair growth stops, follicle rests, and old hair fall off\u2014is shed. At the end of the telegen phase, the follicle begins the cycle again. The length of time of the growing and shedding cycle varies by age and other factors. There is no such thing as a completely non-shedding breed.The coat requires daily brushing with monthly grooming recommended. Grooming must also include regular bathing, eye and ear hygiene and teeth cleaning.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nCharacteristic traits of the Bolognese include: playful, easygoing, earnest, willing, intelligent and loyal. They are not hyperactive and are normally more reserved than the Bichon Frise.The Bolognese is very responsive to obedience training. They are highly intelligent, quick to learn, and easy to train, but can be very stubborn when they don\u2019t get their way. A Bolognese will quickly train to potty pads and a bell-ringing notification system for taking potty breaks outside.\nThe Bolognese genuinely enjoys the companionship of people and forms a close relationship with his owner.They are true companions and thrive on their owner\u2019s attention. They have been known to follow their owners wherever they go. They are friendly with strangers but need to get accustomed to people at a young age. They can be reserved with strangers at first, but the response of the owners to the new person greatly influences their behavior towards the individual. Because of this, they are generally friendly towards strangers after the initial meeting. Bolognese are true watchdogs, but are not incessant barkers. They will notice anything unusual and dependably notify their owners. Bolognese get along well with other dogs but are happy to be the only dog in the family. They are non-aggressive by nature.\nThey do not do well when left alone for long period of time and may develop separation anxiety.Ideal owners of Bolognese include families with children, retirees, and city dwellers. They are good with children as long as the latter are old enough and mature enough to handle these dogs gently, carefully, and safely. They are not a good choice for younger children who could easily injure small dogs.\n\n\n== History ==\nThey belong to the Bichon family group, which includes the Bichon Frise, Maltese, Lowchen, Havanese and Coton de Tulear. Although there are some similarities, the Bolognese are a distinctive breed in their own right. The Bolognese is an ancient breed of noble origins, and has its roots with Italian aristocracy.The precise ancestry of the Bolognese is unknown. Its closest relative within the Bichon group is the Maltese but it is unclear as to whether the Maltese is its direct ancestor or descendant. The Bolognese are named after Bologna, a city in northern Italy, thought to be the place of the breed's establishment. The existence of the Bolognese has been recorded since the year 1200.Bolognese dogs may be seen in tapestry work produced by Flemish craftsmen dating as far back as the 17th century. The Venetian painter Titian painted the Duke Frederico Gonzaga with his Bolognese. The breed is also seen in paintings by Goya, Gosse and Watteau. Other notable owners of the breed include Catherine the Great of Russia (1729-1796), Madame De Pompadour (1721-1764) and Empress Maria Theresa of Austria.The breed was brought into England in 1990 by Liz Stannard and is first shown during that year in the breed registry. In 2001 the breed was able to be shown at all shows with their own classes. They were at Crufts, an annual international dog show, for the first time in 2002.\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\n\n=== Exercise ===\nWhile Bolognese are perfectly happy to lounge around the house, they should also have a daily walk. A suitable walk would be around 20\u201325 minute a couple of times a day or substitute 10-minute walks a few times a day.\n\n\n=== Training ===\nBolognese are easy to train but soon become bored by numerous repetitive drills. They thrive on variety so it is best to change or expand activities to keep them happily engaged and thinking. They respond well to positive reinforcement, gentle training methods and consistency. They do not respond well to shouting or harshness.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n=== Life span ===\nThe average life span of the Bolognese is 14 years.  They can live up to 10 years with relatively few genetic health issues. They are known to still act puppy-like at 10 years of age and are able to maintain aspects of youthfulness throughout their lives. They are typically active well into their senior years.\n\n\n=== Common health problems ===\nBolognese are typically a healthy breed and are not prone to any major problems.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBichon\nCompanion Dog Group\nCompanion dog\nHypoallergenic dog breeds\nToy Group\nLap dog\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBolognese dog at Curlie"}, {"id": 86, "name": "Border Collie", "country": "United Kingdom, Scotland, England, Wales", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog86", "description": "The Border Collie is a working and herding dog breed developed in the Scottish borders for herding livestock, especially sheep. It was specifically bred for intelligence and obedience.\nConsidered highly intelligent, extremely energetic, acrobatic and athletic, they frequently compete with great success in sheepdog trials and dog sports. They are often cited as the most intelligent of all domestic dogs. Border Collies continue to be employed in their traditional work of herding livestock throughout the world.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nIn general, Border Collies are medium-sized dogs with a moderate amount of coat, which is most often thick and sheds often. They have a double coat that varies from smooth to rough and is occasionally curled. While black and white is the most commonly seen colour pattern of the Border Collie, the breed appears in just about any colour and pattern known to occur in dogs. Some of these include black tricolour (black/tan/white), liver and white, and red tricolour (red/tan/white) which have also been seen regularly, and other colours such as blue, lilac, red merle, blue merle, brindle, and Australian red (also known as ee red, blonde, recessive red, or gold) which is seen less frequently. Some Border Collies may also have single-colour coats.Eye colour varies from brown to blue, and occasionally eyes of differing colour occur; this is usually seen with merles. The ears of the Border Collie are also variable \u2014 some have fully erect ears, some fully dropped ears, and others semi-erect ears (similar to those of the rough Collie). Although working Border Collie handlers sometimes have superstitions about the appearance of their dogs (handlers may avoid mostly white dogs due to the unfounded idea that sheep will not respect a white or almost all white dog), in general, the American Border Collie Association considers a dog's appearance to be irrelevant. Instead, it is considered more useful to identify a working Border Collie by its attitude and ability.\nDogs bred for show are more homogeneous in appearance than working Border Collies, since to win in conformation showing they must conform closely to breed club standards that are specific on many points of the structure, coat, and colour. Kennel clubs specify, for example, that the Border Collie must have a \"keen and intelligent\" expression, and that the preferred eye colour is dark brown. In deference to the dog's working origin, scars and broken teeth received in the line of duty are not to be counted against a Border Collie in the show ring. The males' height from withers comes from 48 to 56 centimetres (19 to 22 in), females from 46 to 53 centimetres (18 to 21 in).\n\n\n== Temperament and needs ==\nBorder Collies require considerably more daily physical exercise and mental stimulation than many other breeds. The Border Collie is widely considered to be the most intelligent dog breed. Although the primary role of the Border Collie is to herd livestock, the breed is becoming increasingly popular as a companion animal.\nIn this role, due to their working heritage, Border Collies are very demanding, playful, and energetic. They thrive best in households that can provide them with plenty of play and exercise, either with humans or other dogs. Due to their demanding personalities and need for mental stimulation and exercise, many Border Collies develop problematic behaviours in households that are not able to provide for their needs. They are infamous for chewing holes in walls and furniture, and destructive scraping and hole digging, due to boredom. Border Collies may exhibit a strong desire to herd, a trait they may show with small children, cats, and other dogs. The breed's herding trait has been deliberately encouraged, as it was in the dogs from which the Border Collie was developed, by selective breeding for many generations. However, being eminently trainable, they can live amicably with other pets if given proper socialisation training.\nThe American Border Collie Association recommends that potential owners, before taking on the breed as a household pet, should be sure they can provide regular exercise commensurate with the collie's high energy and prodigious stamina. A working collie may run many miles a day, using its experience, personality and intelligence to control challenging livestock. These dogs will become distressed and frustrated if left in isolation, ignored or inactive. Like many working breeds, Border Collies can be motion-sensitive and may chase moving vehicles and bicycles, but this behaviour can be modified by training. Some of the more difficult behaviours require patience, as they are developmental and may disappear as the dog matures.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n=== Life span ===\n\nThe natural life span of the Border Collie is between 10 and 14 years, with an average lifespan of 12 years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are usually 12 to 13 years.Leading causes of death are cancer (23.6%), old age (17.9%) and cerebral vascular afflictions (9.4%).\n\n\n=== Common health problems ===\nCollie eye anomaly (CEA) and epilepsy are considered the primary genetic diseases of concern in the breed at this time. CEA is a congenital, inherited eye disease involving the retina, choroid, and sclera that sometimes affects Border Collies. In Border Collies, it is generally a mild disease and rarely significantly impairs vision. However, other eye conditions such as PRA slowly disintegrates the retina and can cause Border Collies to lose almost all of their vision at night which can progress into complete daytime blindness. There is now a DNA test available for CEA and, through its use, breeders can ensure that they will not produce affected pups. There are different types of hip testing available including OFA (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals) and PennHip. Radiographs are taken and sent to these organizations to determine a dog's hip and elbow quality.\nTwo types of hearing loss occur in the breed. The first type is pigment associated and is found in Border Collie puppies, although the puppies can have congenital sensorineural deafness from birth as well. The second type is known as adult onset hearing loss. These dogs have a normal auditory brainstem response test as pups but gradually lose their hearing some time between one and eight years of age. A study is currently underway at The Translational Genomics Research Institute to identify the genetic cause of adult onset hearing loss in the breed.\nGlaucoma (GLAU) The discovery of a genetic variant on the OLFML3 gene was performed at The Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh and the Mater Research Institute-UQ, Brisbane Australia. The individuals credited for this work are Kim M Summers, Ailsa J Carlisle, Carys A Pugh and Lindsay L Farrell. Based on this discovery, Animal Genetics develop an assay to detect the genetic variant associated with Border Collie Glaucoma. A paper will be published outlining all of the work.\nNeuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) is a rare but serious disease that is limited to show Border Collies. NCL results in severe neurological impairment and early death; afflicted dogs rarely survive beyond two years of age. The mutation causing the form of the disease found in Border Collies was identified by Scott Melville in the laboratory of Dr. Alan Wilton of the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales. There is no treatment or cure, but a DNA test is now available to detect carriers as well as affected dogs.\nTrapped Neutrophil Syndrome (TNS) is a hereditary disease in which the bone marrow produces neutrophils (white cells) but is unable to effectively release them into the bloodstream. Affected puppies have an impaired immune system and will eventually die from infections they cannot fight. The mutation responsible for TNS has been found in Border Collies in English working dogs, in show dogs that had originated in Australia and New Zealand, and in unrelated Australian working dogs. This indicates that the gene is widespread and probably as old as the breed itself. TNS was identified by Jeremy Shearman in the laboratory of Dr. Alan Wilton of the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales. There is no cure, but a DNA test is now available to detect carriers as well as affected dogs.Other diseases found less commonly include juvenile cataracts, osteochondritis, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus and canine cyclic neutropaenia, carpal soft-tissue injury. A syndrome of exercise induced collapse similar to that seen in Labrador Retrievers (otherwise termed Border Collie Collapse) and triggered by episodes of collapse associated with periods of intense exercise has been described in Border Collies in North America, Europe and Australia; and is currently the subject of further investigation.Elbow dysplasia may also occur in the breed. Dogs homozygous for the merle gene, sometimes referred to as \"double merles\", are likely to have ocular and/or auditory defects.\nBorder Collie Collapse or \"the wobbles\" is a disease found in many herding/working breeds. The cause is currently unknown. Border Collie Collapse seems to be related to high intensity exercises that are found to be particularly exciting to the individual dog. For example: some dogs cannot retrieve a tennis ball, as they find this activity highly stimulating, but can run for several miles with no symptoms of Border Collie Collapse. Symptoms commonly include: disorientation, mental dullness, loss of attention, unsteady hind legs, dragging of hind legs, and ultimately the need to sit or lay down. Loss of\nconsciousness and seizure-like trembling/spasms are not characteristics of Border Collie Collapse. There is no current diagnostic test or veterinary workup that can confirm Border Collie Collapse and the diagnosis is often given as a diagnosis of exclusion or based on clinical symptoms. There is no current treatment recommended, and it is advised to limit the episodes by avoiding the activities that trigger the collapse.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Border Collie is descended from landrace collies, a type found widely in the British Isles. The name for the breed came from its probable place of origin along the Anglo-Scottish border. Mention of the \"Collie\" or \"Colley\" type first appeared toward the end of the 19th century, although the word \"collie\" is older than this and has its origin in the Scots language. It is also thought that the word 'collie' comes from the old Celtic word for useful. Many of the best Border Collies today can be traced back to a dog known as Old Hemp.In 1915, James Reid, Secretary of the International Sheep Dog Society (ISDS) in the United Kingdom first used the term \"Border Collie\" to distinguish those dogs registered by the ISDS from the Kennel Club's Collie (or Scotch Collie, including the Rough Collie and Smooth Collie) which originally came from the same working stock but had developed a different, standardised appearance following introduction to the show ring in 1860 and mixture with different breeds.\n\n\n=== Old Hemp ===\n\nOld Hemp, a tricolour dog, was born in Northumberland in September 1893 and died in May 1901. He was bred by Adam Telfer from Roy, a black and tan dog, and Meg, a black-coated, strong-eyed dog. Hemp was a quiet, powerful dog to which sheep responded easily. Many shepherds used him for stud and Hemp's working style became the Border Collie style. All pure Border Collies alive today can trace an ancestral line back to Old Hemp. He was believed to have sired as many as 200 pups over the span of his life.\n\n\n=== Wiston Cap ===\nWiston Cap (b. 28 September 1963) is the dog that the International Sheep Dog Society (ISDS) badge portrays in the characteristic Border Collie herding pose. He was a popular stud dog in the history of the breed, and his bloodline can be seen in most bloodlines of the modern day Collie. Bred by W. S. Hetherington and trained and handled by John Richardson, Cap was a biddable and good-natured dog. His bloodlines all trace back to the early registered dogs of the stud book, and to J. M. Wilson's Cap, whose name occurs 16 times within seven generations in his pedigree. Wiston Cap sired three Supreme Champions and is grand-sire of three others, one of whom was E. W. Edwards' Bill, who won the championship twice.\n\n\n=== Introduction to New Zealand and Australia ===\nCollies were listed as imports to New Zealand as early as 1858, but the type was not specified. In the late 1890s James Lilico (1861?\u20131945) of Christchurch, New Zealand, imported a number of working dogs from the United Kingdom. These included Hindhope Jed, a black, tan and white born in Hindhope, Scotland in 1895, as well as Maudie, Moss of Ancrum, Ness and Old Bob.\nIt is unclear whether Hindhope Jed was a descendant of Old Hemp. Born two years after him, she is mentioned in a British Hunts and Huntsmen article concerning a Mr John Elliot of Jedburgh:\nMr. Elliot himself is well known for his breed of Collies. His father supplied Noble to the late Queen Victoria and it was from our subject that the McLeod got Hindhope Jed, now the champion of New Zealand and Australia.\nAt the time of her departure to New Zealand, Hindhope Jed was already in pup to Captain, another of the then new \"Border\" strain. Hindhope Jed had won three trials in her native Scotland, and was considered to be the \"best to cross the equator\".In 1901 the King and Mcleod stud, created by Charles Beechworth King (b. 1855, Murrumbidgee, NSW), his brother and Alec McLeod at Canonbar, near Nyngan (north-west of Sydney), brought Hindhope Jed to Australia, where she enjoyed considerable success at sheep dog trials.\n\n\n== Breed standards ==\n\nThere are two types of tests, or standards, to determine the breeding quality of a Border Collie: the original ISDS sheepdog trial and appearance.\n\n\n=== ISDS sheepdog trial ===\nThe original test is the ISDS sheepdog trial. It is still used today, where a dog and handler collect groups of livestock and move them quietly around a course. There are certain standard elements to this test depending on the level: national or international. For both levels, sheep must be gathered as calmly as possible without being distressed. For a national competition, normally held between England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, trials run over a 400-yard course. International courses use a 400-yard course for the qualifying trials, but on the third and final day, trials are held in a course of 800 yards. The international test involves a \"double fetch\", where the sheepdog must gather 10 sheep from 800 yards away, bring them on an angle to the center of the field, and then be sent back in another direction to gather another 10 sheep, also placed 800 yards from the handler. Five of those 20 sheep will have collars on, and at the end of a triangular drive, the sheep are gathered into a circular \"shedding ring\" and the 15 sheep without collars driven away as the five collared sheep are kept inside the ring and then penned. Sheepdogs must be directed through obstacles at varying distance from the handler, and then the dog must demonstrate the ability to do work close at hand by penning the sheep and sorting them out.\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nIn nearly every region of the world, the Border Collie is now also a breed which is shown in ring or bench shows. For the people who participate in these events, the Border Collie is defined by the breed standard, which is a description of how the dog should look. In New Zealand and Australia, where the breed has been shown throughout most of the twentieth century, the Border Collie standards have produced a dog with the longer double coat (smooth coats are allowed), a soft dark eye, a body slightly longer than tall, a well-defined stop, semi-pricked ears, as well as a gentle and friendly temperament. This style of Border Collie has become popular in winning show kennels around the world, as well as among prestigious judges. Breed standards state that its tail must be slightly curved and must stop at the hock. The fur must be lush. It should show good expression in its eyes, and must be intelligent. It is energetic with most commonly a black and white coat (sometimes brown). It should have a very strong herding instinct.\n\nAway from breed standards, short haired Border collie variants are also found, offering householders a less demanding task clearing year-round shed hair. Crossing collies with German Shepherd dogs produces a strong intelligent hybrid of intermediate size, popularly named a \"shollie\", used as a working dog with livestock and as an animal companion.\n\n\n=== Criticism of show dog conformity based on appearance ===\nOther enthusiasts oppose the use of Border Collies as show dogs, for fear that breeding for appearance will lead to a decline in the breed's working dog traits. Few handlers of working Border Collies participate in conformation shows, as working dogs are bred to a performance standard rather than appearance standard. Likewise, conformation-bred dogs are seldom seen on the sheepdog trial field, except in Kennel Club-sponsored events. Dogs registered with either working or conformation based registries are seen in other performance events such as agility, obedience, tracking or flyball; however, these dogs do not necessarily conform to the breed standard of appearance as closely as the dogs shown in the breed rings as this is not a requirement in performance events, nor do they necessarily participate in herding activities.\n\n\n== Registries ==\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the UK, there are two separate registries for Border Collies. The International Sheep Dog Society encourages breeding for herding ability, whereas the Kennel Club (UK) encourages breeding for a standardised appearance. The ISDS registry is by far the older of the two, and ISDS dogs are eligible for registration as pedigree Border Collies with the Kennel Club (KC) \u2014 but not vice versa. The only way for a Border Collie without an ISDS pedigree to be added to the ISDS registry is by proving its worth as a herding dog so that it can be Registered on Merit (ROM).\n\n\n=== United States ===\nOne of the principal registries for Border Collies in the United States is the American Border Collie Association (ABCA), which is dedicated to the preservation of the traditional working dog. The breed was also recognised in 1995 by the American Kennel Club (AKC) after occupying the AKC's Miscellaneous Class for over 50 years. The recognition was under protest from the majority of Border Collie affiliated groups, such as the United States Border Collie Club, which felt that emphasis on the breed's working skills would be lost under AKC recognition. AKC registrations have gradually increased since recognition and by the year 2004 there were 1,984 new AKC registrations of Border Collies, with a further 2,378 for the year 2005. By contrast, the American Border Collie Association registers approximately 20,000 Border Collies annually. Because of the inherent tension between the goals of breeding to a working standard and to an appearance standard, the American Border Collie Association voted in 2003 that dogs who attained a conformation championship would be delisted from the ABCA registry, regardless of ability. Cross-registration is allowed between the working registries, and AKC accepts dogs registered with ABCA and NASDS, but none of the working registries in the U.S. honors AKC pedigrees.\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn Australia, Border Collies are registered with an Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) affiliated state control body or with a working dog registry. Between 2,011 and 2,701 ANKC pedigreed Border Collies have been registered with the ANKC each year since 1986. Inclusion on the ANKC affiliate's main register allows Border Collies to compete in conformation, obedience, agility, tracking, herding and other ANKC-sanctioned events held by an ANKC affiliated club, while inclusion on the limited register prohibits entry in conformation events. The ANKC provides a breed standard; however, this applies to conformation events only and has no influence on dogs entering in performance events. Non-ANKC pedigreed dogs may also be eligible for inclusion on an ANKC associate or sporting register and be able to compete in ANKC performance or herding events. Agility organisations such as the Agility Dog Association of Australia (ADAA) have their own registry which allows the inclusion of any dog wishing to compete in their events.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nIn Canada, Agriculture Canada has recognised the Canadian Border Collie Association as the registry under the Animal Pedigree Act for any Border Collie that is designated as \"Pure Breed\" in Canada.\nThe criteria used are based on herding lineage rather than appearance. It is a two-tiered registry in that dogs imported that are registered with a foreign Kennel Club that does hold conformation shows are given a \"B\" registration, whereas those that come directly from other working registries are placed on the \"A\" registry.\nRecently, the Canadian Kennel Club has polled its members to decide if Border Collies should be included on the CKC \"Miscellaneous List\". This designation would allow Border Collie owners the ability to compete in all CKC events, but the CKC would not be the registering body. People who compete in performance events support the move. The CBCA is against this designation.\n\n\n=== South Africa ===\nThe registration of working sheepdogs in South Africa is the responsibility of the South African Sheepdog Association. ISDS registered dogs imported into the country can be transferred onto the SASDA register. Dogs not registered can become eligible for registration by being awarded a certificate of working ability by a registered judge. Occasionally they will facilitate the testing of dogs used for breeding, for Hip dysplasia and Collie eye anomaly, to encourage the breeding of dogs without these genetic flaws.\n\n\n=== Turkey ===\nThe registration of working Border Collies in Turkey is the province of the Border Collie Dernegi (Turkish Border Collie Association) established in 2007.\n\n\n=== Elsewhere ===\nThe Border Collie breed is also recognised as the prime sheep dog by the International Stock Dog Federation (ISDF), based in Piccadilly, London, UK.\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\nBorder Collies are one of the most popular breeds for dog agility competitions. They also excel at competitive obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and USBCHA Sheepdog trials and herding events.\n\n\n== Livestock work ==\n\nWorking Border Collies can take direction by voice and by whistle at long distances when herding. Their great energy and herding instinct are still used to herd all kinds of animals, from the traditional sheep and cattle, to free range poultry, pigs, and ostriches. They are also used to remove unwanted wild birds from airport runways, golf courses, and other public and private areas.\nThe use of dogs for herding sheep makes good economic sense for many farmers. In a typical pasture environment each trained sheepdog will do the work of three humans. In vast arid areas like the Australian Outback or the Karoo Escarpment, the number increases to five or more. Attempts to replace them with mechanical approaches to herding have only achieved a limited amount of success. Thus, stock handlers find trained dogs more reliable and economical.Shepherds in the UK have taken the most critical elements of herding and incorporated them into a sheepdog trial. The first recorded sheepdog trials were held in Bala, North Wales, in 1873. These competitions enable farmers and shepherds to evaluate possible mates for their working dogs, but they have developed a sport aspect as well, with competitors from outside the farming community also taking part.\nIn the US, the national sanctioning body for these competitions is the USBCHA. In the UK it is the International Sheep Dog Society, in Canada the Canadian Border Collie Association (CBCA) and in South Africa it is the South African Sheepdog Association.\n\n\n=== Dog sports ===\nBorder Collies excel at several dog sports in addition to their success in sheepdog trials due to their high instinct of herding. Herding instincts and trainability can be tested for when introduced to sheep or at noncompetitive instinct tests. Border Collies exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in sheepdog trials and other herding events. They perform well at some higher jump heights at dog agility competitions, so much so that in England, competitions often include classes for ABC dogs, \"Anything But Collies\".The Border Collie's speed, agility, and stamina have allowed them to dominate in dog activities like flyball and disc dog competitions. Their trainability has also given them a berth in dog dancing competitions.\nBorder Collies have a highly developed sense of smell and with their high drive make excellent and easily motivated tracking dogs for Tracking trials. These trials simulate the finding of a lost person in a controlled situation where the performance of the dog can be evaluated, with titles awarded for successful dogs.\n\n\n== Notable Border Collies ==\nRico, who was studied for recognising up to 200 objects by name. Another Border Collie, Betsy, was found to have a vocabulary of over 300 words.\nAs of 2010, the Border Collie Chaser has a vocabulary of 1022 words and is able to recognise objects by the groups they belong to.\nShep, who was the long-term companion to John Noakes of the BBC's Blue Peter and Meg, companion of Matt Baker, former presenter of the same show.\nShep was also a dog that appeared at a railway station in 1936 and watched his dead master be loaded onto a train.

Bred as a fox and vermin hunter, the Border Terrier shares ancestry with the Dandie Dinmont Terrier and the Bedlington Terrier.The Border Terrier was officially recognized by The Kennel Club in Great Britain in 1920, and by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1930.  The border  terrier was bred to have long enough legs to keep up with the horses and other foxhounds, which traveled with them, and small enough bodies to crawl in the burrows of foxes and chase them out so the hunters had a blank shot. The foxhounds that traveled with them were not small enough to do the Border terrier's job.\nIn 2006, the Border Terrier ranked 81st in number of registrations by the AKC, while it ranked 10th in the United Kingdom.In 2008, the Border Terrier ranked 8th in number of registrations by the UK Kennel Club.\nThey are originally used for hunting in packs as they were exceptionally good at catching rabbits and any small animal. Now they are commonly seen as family pets. \n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nIdentifiable by their otter-shaped heads, Border Terriers have a broad skull and short (although many are fairly long), and strong teeth.  The V-shaped ears are on the sides of the head and fall towards the cheeks.  Common coat colors are grizzle-and-tan, blue-and-tan, red, or wheaten. Whiskers are few and short. The tail is naturally moderately short, thick at the base and tapering.Narrow-bodied and well-proportioned, males stand 13 to 16 in (33 to 41 cm) at the shoulder, and weigh 13 to 15.5 lb (5.9 to 7.0 kg); females 11 to 14 in (28 to 36 cm) and 11.5 to 14 pounds (5.2 to 6.4 kg). They are very versatile in families and as family pets\nThe Border Terrier has a double coat consisting of a short, dense, soft undercoat and harsh, wiry weather- and dirt-resistant, close-lying outer coat with no curl or wave. This coat usually requires hand-stripping twice a year to remove dead hair.  It then takes about eight weeks for the top coat to come back in.  For some dogs, weekly brushing will suffice. Most Border Terriers are seen groomed with short hair but longer hair can sometimes be preferred.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThough sometimes stubborn and strong willed, border terriers are sound dogs. They are friendly and rarely aggressive. They are very good with children, but may chase cats and other small pets.\nBorders do well in task-oriented activities and have a surprising ability to jump high and run fast given the size of their legs. The breed has excelled in agility training, but they are quicker to learn jumps and see-saws than weaving poles. They take training for tasks very well, and are extremely trainable, and capable of learning tricks quickly and competently. The border in recent years has been bred to harbor a more subtle character so are more adaptable to apartment living if properly exercised.\nThey are intelligent and eager to please, but they retain the capacity for independent thinking and initiative that were bred into them for working rats and fox underground. Their love of people and even temperament make them fine therapy dogs, especially for children and the elderly, and they are occasionally used to aid the blind or deaf. From a young age they should be trained on command.\nBorders can adapt to different environments and situations well, and are able to deal with temporary change well. They will get along well with cats that they have been raised with, but may chase other cats and small animals such as mice, birds, rabbits, squirrels, rats, and guinea pigs.\nBorders are very independent and loyal. Some borders are known to be territorial and will protect their homes. They have a strong sense of smell and can tell when danger is near.\nBorders love to sit and watch what is going on. Walks with Borders will often involve them sitting and lying in the grass to observe the environment around them.\n\n\n== Health ==\nBorders are a generally hardy breed, though there are certain genetic health problems associated with them, including:\n\nHip dysplasia\nPerthes disease\nVarious heart defects\nJuvenile cataracts\nProgressive retinal atrophy\nSeizures\nCanine epileptoid cramping syndrome (CECS)A UK Kennel Club survey puts their median lifespan at 14 years.\n\n\n== Earthdog trials ==\n\nBorder Terriers have earned more American Kennel Club (AKC) Earthdog titles than any other terrier.  An AKC earthdog test is not true hunting, but an artificial, non-competitive, exercise in which terriers enter 9 in (23 cm) wide smooth wooden tunnels, buried under-ground, with one or more turns in order to bark or scratch at caged rats that are safely housed behind wooden bars.   The tests are conducted to determine that instinctive traits are preserved and developed, as the breed originators intended for the dogs to their work. While earthdog tests are not a close approximation of hunting, they are popular in the U.S. and in some European countries because even over-large Kennel Club breeds can negotiate the tunnels with ease, dogs can come to no harm while working, and no digging is required.  Since Border Terriers are \"essentially working terriers\", many Border Terrier owners consider it important to test and develop their dogs' instinct. These tests also provide great satisfaction for the dogs.  The American Working Terrier Association (AWTA) does conduct \"trials\"; where the dogs instincts are tested, and then judged to determine a \"Best of Breed\" Earthdog.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally the Border Terrier was referred to as the Coquetdale Terrier or Redesdale Terrier from the area in which it evolved, but by the late 1800s it was generally known as the Border Terrier, probably because of its long history with the Border Hunt in Northumberland. It shares its ancestry with that of the Bedlington Terrier and the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. It was recognised as a breed by the Kennel Club in 1920, the same year The Border Terrier Club was formed.  Their original purpose was to bolt foxes which had gone to ground. They were also used to kill rodents, but they have been used to hunt otters and badgers too.\nThe first Kennel Club Border Terrier ever registered was The Moss Trooper, a dog sired by Jacob Robson's Chip in 1912 and registered in the Kennel Club's Any Other Variety listing in 1913. The Border Terrier was rejected for formal Kennel Club recognition in 1914, but won its slot in 1920, with the first standard being written by Jacob Robson and John Dodd. Jasper Dodd was made first President of the Club.\n\n\n== Famous Border Terriers ==\nBrillo in Misfits episode \"Four\" as a street puppy eaten by new zombie Curtis\nChomp in 102 Dalmatians\nHacker T.

Russkaya psovaya borzaya), is a breed of domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris). Descended from dogs brought to Russia from central Asian countries, it is similar in shape to a greyhound, and is also a member of the sighthound family.\nThe system by which Russians over the ages named their sighthounds was a series of descriptive terms, not actual names. Borz\u00f3i is the masculine singular form of an archaic Russian adjective that means \"fast\". Borz\u00e1ya sob\u00e1ka (\"fast dog\") is the basic term used by Russians, though sob\u00e1ka is usually dropped. The name psovaya derived from the word psovina, which means \"wavy, silky coat\", just as hortaya (as in hortaya borzaya) means shorthaired. In Russian today the breed we know as the borzoi is officially known as russkaya psovaya borzaya. Other Russian sighthound breeds are stepnaya borzaya (from the steppe), called stepnoi; and krimskaya borzaya (from the Crimea), called krimskoi.\nThe most commonly used plural form is the regular formation borzois, which is the only plural cited in most dictionaries. However, the Borzoi Club of America and the Borzoi Club UK both prefer borzoi as the form for both singular and plural forms.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nBorzois are large Russian sighthounds that resemble some central Asian breeds such as the Afghan hound, Saluki, and the Kyrgyz Taigan. Borzois can generally be described as \"long-haired greyhounds\".  Borzois come in virtually any colour. The borzoi coat is silky and flat, often wavy or slightly curly. The long top-coat is  quite flat, with varying degrees of waviness or curling. The soft undercoat thickens during winter or in cold climates, but is shed in hot weather to prevent overheating. In its texture and distribution over the body, the borzoi coat is unique. There should be a frill on its neck, as well as feathering on its hindquarters and tail.Borzoi males frequently weigh more than 100 pounds (45 kg). Males stand at least 30 inches (76 cm) at the shoulder, while the height of females is around 26 inches (66 cm). Despite their size, the overall impression is of streamlining and grace, with a curvy shapeliness and compact strength.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe borzoi is an athletic and independent breed of dog. Most borzois are fairly quiet, barking on rare occasions. They do not have strong territorial drives and cannot be relied on to raise the alarm upon sighting a human intruder. The borzoi requires patient, experienced handling. They are gentle and highly sensitive dogs with a natural respect for humans, and as adults they are decorative couch potatoes with remarkably gracious house manners. Borzois do not generally display dominance or aggression towards people, but can turn aggressive if handled roughly. Typically, they are rather reserved with strangers but affectionate with people they know well. Their sensitivity to invasion of their personal space can make them nervous around children unless they are brought up with them. Borzois adapt well to suburban life, provided they have a spacious yard and regular opportunities for free exercise.A common misunderstanding about the intelligence of breeds in the Hound group stems from their independent nature, which conflicts with the frequent confusion between the concepts of \"intelligence\" and \"obedience\" in discussions of canine brainpower. Stanley Coren's survey of canine obedience trainers published in The Intelligence of Dogs reported that borzois obeyed the first command less than 25% of the time. Coren's test, however, was by his own admission heavily weighted towards the \"obedience\" interpretation of intelligence and based on a better understanding of \"working\" breeds than hounds. Unfortunately, the publicity given to this report has led to unfair denigration of breeds which are under-represented in obedience clubs and poorly understood by the average obedience trainer. \"Work\" for hound breeds is done out of hearing and often out of sight of the human companion; it is an activity for which the dogs are \"released\", rather than an activity which is \"commanded\".In terms of obedience, borzois are selective learners who quickly become bored with repetitive, apparently pointless, activity, and they can be very stubborn when they are not properly motivated. For example, food rewards, or \"baiting\", may work well for some individuals, but not at all for others. Nevertheless, borzois are definitely capable of enjoying and performing well in competitive obedience and agility trials with the right kind of training. Like other sighthounds, they are very sensitive and do not cope well with harsh treatment or training based on punishment, and will be extremely unhappy if raised voices and threats are a part of their daily life. However, like any intelligent dog, borzois respond extremely well to the guidance, support, and clear communication of a benevolent human leadership.\nBorzois were bred to pursue or \"course\" game and have a powerful instinct to chase things that run from them, including cats and small dogs. Built for speed and endurance, they can cover long distances in a very short time. A fully fenced yard is a necessity for maintaining any sighthound. They are highly independent and will range far and wide without containment, with little regard for road traffic. For off-leash exercise, a borzoi needs a very large field or park, either fully fenced or well away from any roads, to ensure its safety. \nBorzois are born with specialized coursing skills, but these are quite different from the dog-fighting instincts seen in some breeds. It is quite common for borzois at play to course (i.e., run down) another dog, seize it by the neck and hold it immobile. Young pups do this with their littermates, trading off as to who is the prey. It is a specific hunting behavior, not a fighting or territorial domination behavior.Borzois can be raised very successfully to live with cats and other small animals provided they are introduced to them when they are puppies. Some, however, will possess the hunting instinct to such a degree that they find it impossible not to chase a cat that is moving quickly. The hunting instinct is triggered by movement and much depends on how the cat behaves.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nStated life expectancy is 10 to 12 years. Median lifespan based on a UK Kennel Club survey is 9 years 1 month. 1 in 5 died of old age, at an average of 10 to 11.5 years. The longest lived dog lived to 14 years 3 months.  Dogs that are physically fit and vigorous in their youth through middle age are more vigorous and healthy as elderly dogs, all other factors being equal. In the UK, cancer and cardiac problems seem to be the most frequent causes of premature death.Like its native relative the Hortaya Borzaya, the borzoi is basically a very sound breed. OCD, hip and elbow dysplasia have remained almost unknown, as were congenital eye and heart diseases before the 1970s. However, in some countries modern breeding practices have introduced a few problems.\nAs with other very deep-chested breeds, gastric dilatation volvulus (also known as bloat) is the most common serious health problem in the borzoi. This life-threatening condition is believed to be anatomical rather than strictly genetic in origin. One common recommendation in the past has been to raise the food bowl of the dog when it eats. However, studies have shown that this may actually increase the risk of bloat.Less common are cardiac problems including cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmia disorders. A controversy exists as to the presence of progressive retinal atrophy in the breed. A condition identified as borzoi retinopathy is seen in some individuals, usually active dogs, which differs from progressive retinal atrophy in several ways. First, it is unilateral, and rarely seen in animals less than three years of age; second, a clear-cut pattern of inheritance has not been demonstrated; and finally, most affected individuals do not go blind.\n\nCorrect nutrition during puppyhood is also debatable for borzois. These dogs naturally experience enormous growth surges in the first year or two of their lives. It is now widely accepted that forcing even faster growth by feeding a highly concentrated, high-energy diet is dangerous for skeletal development, causing unsoundness and increased tendency to joint problems and injury. Being built primarily for speed, borzois do not carry large amounts of body fat or muscle, and therefore have a rather different physiology to other dogs of similar size (such as the Newfoundland, St. Bernard, or Alaskan Malamute). Laboratory-formulated diets designed for a generic \"large\" or \"giant\" breed are unlikely to take the needs of the big sighthounds into account.\nThe issues involved in raw feeding may be particularly relevant to tall, streamlined breeds such as the borzoi.The Hortaya Borzaya, a very close relative, is traditionally raised on a meager diet of oats and table scraps. The Hortaya is also said to be intolerant of highly concentrated kibble feeds. A lean body weight in itself is nothing to be concerned about, and force-feeding of healthy young borzoi is definitely not recommended.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIt was long thought that Saluki type sighthounds were originally brought to Russia from Byzantium in the South about the 9th and 10th centuries and again later by the Mongol invaders from the East. However, now that the archeological archives and research results of the former USSR are open to scientists, it has become quite clear that the primal sighthound type evolved between the Kyrgyzstan, the lower Kazakhstan part of Altai and the Afghan plains, and that the earliest actual sighthound breeds were the plains Afghan hounds and the Kyrgyz Taigan.These ancient breeds then migrated South (founding the Tazi/Saluki branch) and West (founding the Stepnaya, Krimskaya and Hortaya branches) to develop into breeds adapted to those regions. This was a slow process which happened naturally through normal spreading of trade, with the silk and spice trade via the Silk Road being the prime vector.The more modern Psovaya Borzaya was founded on Stepnaya, Hortaya and the Ukrainian-Polish version of the old Hort. There were also imports of Western sighthound breeds to add to the height and weight. It was crossed as well with the Russian Laika specifically and singularly to add resistance against Northern cold and a longer and thicker coat than the Southern sighthounds were equipped with.All of these foundation types\u2014Tazi, Hortaya, Stepnaya, Krimskaya, and Hort\u2014already possessed the instincts and agility necessary for hunting and bringing down wolves.\nThe Psovoi was popular with the Tsars before the 1917 revolution. For centuries, Psovoi could not be purchased but only given as gifts from the Tsar. Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaievich of Russia bred countless Psovoi at Perchino, his private estate.The Russian concept of hunting trials was instituted during the era of the Tsars. As well as providing exciting sport, the tests were used for selecting borzoi breeding stock; only the quickest and most intelligent hunting dogs went on to produce progeny. For the aristocracy these trials were a well-organized ceremony, sometimes going on for days, with the borzois accompanied by mounted hunters and Foxhounds on the Russian steppe. Hares and other small game were by far the most numerous kills, but the hunters especially loved to test their dogs on wolf. If a wolf was sighted, the hunter would release a team of two or three borzois. The dogs would pursue the wolf, attack its neck from both sides, and hold it until the hunter arrived. The classic kill was by the human hunter with a knife. Wolf trials are still a regular part of the hunting diploma for all Russian sightdog breeds of the relevant type, either singly or in pairs or trios, in their native country.\nAfter the 1917 Revolution, wolf hunting with sighthounds has soon gone out of fashion as an \"aristocratic\" and a means- and -time-taking way of hunting.\nA necessity in a wolf-catching sighthound didn't exist, in addition to the old proved technique of batue with the use of baits, flags and other appeared new, way more effective\u2014from airplanes, from propeller sleighs, with electronic lure whistles. For decades the generations of few remaining sighthounds were regarded as hunting-suited, when showing enough attacking initiative for fox hunting. The rumours about persecution of sighthounds in post-revolutionary Russia is a legend of modern times, possibly based on similar incidents in Maoist China.\nIn the late 1940s, a Soviet soldier named Constantin Esmont made detailed records of the various types of borzoi he found in Cossack villages. Esmont's illustrations were recently published and can be viewed by clicking on the link below.\nEsmont was concerned that the distinct types of borzaya were in danger of degenerating without a controlled system of breeding. He convinced the Soviet government that borzois were a valuable asset to the hunters who supported the fur industry and henceforth, their breeding was officially regulated. To this day short-haired Hortaya Borzaya are highly valued hunting dogs on the steppes, while the long-haired Psovaya Borzaya, is going through a hard period of restoration of its working qualities after decades of shadow, mainly show existence.\nExports of borzois to other countries were extremely rare during the Soviet era. However, enough had been taken to England, Scandinavia, Western Europe, and America in the late 19th century for the breed to establish itself outside its native country.\n\n\n== Notable borzois ==\n\nThe borzoi is the symbol of Alfred A. Knopf publishing house.\nTasha, a female borzoi belonging to the noted vet Buster Lloyd-Jones (founder of Denes natural pet foods), was born in the UK during the Second World War and is the pedigree ancestor of most British borzoi bloodlines.\nBen was the white male borzoi, beloved of Edward J. Smith, Captain of the Titanic. There exists a photo of the Captain and his dog outside his cabin on the ship. The dog was not, however, on the maiden voyage.\nKolchak has been the mascot of the 27th Infantry Regiment since the Regiment participated in the Siberian Intervention. The 27th Infantry had been nicknamed \"The Wolfhounds\" in recognition of their endurance during battles in Siberia.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nLeo Tolstoy's 1869 novel War and Peace contains an extensive wolf hunting scene with borzois in book 7, chapters 3 to 6.\nF. Scott Fitzgerald's second novel, The Beautiful and Damned (1922), contains a scene in which Gloria compares Anthony to a Russian wolfhound.

The breed is a scenthound, originally used to hunt large game. Other names include Bosnian Hound and Illyrian Hound.  Alternative descriptive names include Bosnian Rough-haired Hound, Bosnian Rough-coated Hound and Bosnian Coarse-haired Hound.  These names refer to the texture of the shaggy coat, usually called broken-haired or hard in English dog fancier jargon.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe former name given to the breed was Illyrian Hound, referring to a pre-Slavic people of the area. Today's breed is descended from indigenous dog types, crossed with an Italian gun dog in the 1890s. \"Local hunters, wanting to produce an efficient scent hound, developed this breed in the nineteenth century, using the available stock of dogs.\" The early type of today's smaller Istrian Shorthaired Hound may also have contributed to the Bosnian Coarse-haired Hound.\nThe Bosnian Coarse-haired Hound was first recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1965 under the name of \"Illyrian Hound\". The name was changed to more accurately describe its area of origin in Bosnia. The breed is in Group 6, Scenthounds, Section 1.1 Large-sized Hounds, and is breed number 155. It is also recognised by the United Kennel Club (US) as the \"Barak\", in the Scenthound Group. The breed is not recognised by any other major kennel clubs in the English speaking world, although many minor kennel clubs, internet dog registry businesses, and rare breed registries promote and register it as a unique pet.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe most striking feature of the Bosnian Coarse-haired Hound is its shaggy, hard coat of yellowish (wheaten or red) or greyish colours, often with a white blaze on its head along with other white marks. The standard calls for a body length ten percent greater than height; these proportions are given to differentiate the Bosnian Coarse-haired Hound from other hounds of the area which are \"a bit low on leg\" Height ranges from 43\u201355 cm (17\u201322 in) at the withers, and weight is between 16\u201327 kg (35\u201360 lb). The dog normally carries its tail curved slightly upward, and its face has a bushy moustache and beard.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe breed standard describes its behaviour as lively, as well as courageous and persistent.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 90, "name": "Boston Terrier", "country": "United States", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog90", "description": "The Boston Terrier is a breed of dog originating in the United States of America. This \"American Gentleman\" was accepted in 1893 by the American Kennel Club as a non-sporting breed. Color and markings are important when distinguishing this breed to the AKC standard. They should be either black, brindle or seal with white markings. Bostons are small and compact with a short tail and erect ears. The AKC says they are highly intelligent and very easily trained. They are friendly and can be stubborn at times. The average life span of a Boston is around 11 to 13 years, though some can live well into their teens.The American Kennel Club ranked the Boston Terrier as the 21st most popular breed in 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Boston terrier breed originated around 1870, when Robert C. Hooper of Boston, purchased from Edward Burnett a dog named Judge (known later as Hooper's Judge), which was of a Bull and Terrier type lineage. Hooper's Judge is either directly related to the original Bull and Terrier breeds of the 19th and early 20th centuries, or Judge is the result of modern English Bulldogs being crossed into terriers created in the 1860s for show purposes, like the White English Terrier. The American Kennel Club cites Hooper's Judge as the ancestor of almost all true modern Boston Terriers.Judge weighed over 27.5 pounds (12.5 kg).  The offspring interbred with one or more French Bulldogs, providing the foundation for the Boston Terrier. Bred down in size from fighting dogs of the Bull and Terrier types, the Boston Terrier originally weighed up to 44 pounds (20 kg) (Olde Boston Bulldogge). \nThe breed was first shown in Boston in 1870. By 1889 the breed had become sufficiently popular in Boston that fanciers formed the American Bull Terrier Club, the breed's nickname, \"roundheads\". Shortly after, at the suggestion of James Watson (a noted writer and authority), the club changed its name to the Boston Terrier Club and in 1893 it was admitted to membership in the American Kennel Club, thus making it the first US breed to be recognized. It is one of a small number of breeds to have originated in the United States. The Boston Terrier was the first non-sporting dog bred in the US.\nIn the early years, the color and markings were not very important. By the 20th century the breed's distinctive markings and color were written into the standard, becoming an essential feature. The Boston Terrier has lost most of its aggressive nature, preferring the company of humans, although some males will still challenge other dogs if they feel their territory is being invaded. \nBoston University's mascot is Rhett the Boston Terrier. The Boston Terrier is also the mascot of Wofford College in Spartanburg, S.C.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Boston Terrier is a compactly built, well-proportioned dog. It has a square-looking head with erect ears and a slightly arched neck. The muzzle is short and generally wrinkle-free, with an even or a slightly undershot bite.  The chest is broad and the tail is short. According to international breed standards, the dog should weigh no more than 25 pounds (11 kg). Boston Terriers usually stand up to 15-17 inches at the withers.The American Kennel Club divides the breed into three classes: under 15 pounds, 15 pounds and under 20 pounds, 20 pounds and not exceeding 25 pounds.\n\n\n=== Coat and color ===\nThe Boston Terrier is characteristically marked with white in proportion to either black, brindle, seal (color of a wet seal, a very dark brown that looks black except in the bright sun), or a combination of the three. Any other color is not accepted as a Boston Terrier by the American Kennel Club, as they are usually obtained by crossbreeding with other breeds and the dog loses its characteristic \"tuxedo\" appearance.According to the American Kennel Club, an ideal Boston Terrier should have white that covers its chest, muzzle, band around the neck, halfway up the forelegs, up to the hocks on the rear legs, and a white blaze between (but not touching) the eyes. For conformation showing, symmetrical markings are preferred. Due to the Boston Terrier's markings resembling formal wear, in addition to its refined and pleasant personality, the breed is commonly referred to as the \"American Gentleman.\"\n\n\n=== Notable features ===\nThe Boston Terrier's large, prominent pair of eyes is a distinguishable feature. The breed's round eyes are set widely apart, are large in size, and located squarely in the skull.The breed's genetic makeup produces a short tail. These short tails can take the shape of a corkscrew, or curl, or they can be straight. Generally, Boston Terriers' tails do not exceed two inches in length.\n\n\n== Behavior ==\nBoston is a gentle breed that typically has a strong, happy-go-lucky, and friendly personality with a merry sense of humour. Bostons are generally eager to please their owner and can be easily trained. They can be very protective of their owners, which may result in aggressive and territorial behavior toward other pets and strangers. The breed requires only a minimal amount of grooming.While originally bred for fighting as well as hunting rats in garment factories, they were later down bred for companionship. They are not considered terriers by the American Kennel Club, however, but are part of the non-sporting group.Both females and males are generally quiet and bark only when necessary, though early training in this regard is essential. Their usually sensible attitude towards barking makes them excellent choices for apartment dwellers. They enjoy being around people, get along well with children, the elderly, other canines, and non-canine pets, if properly socialized.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nCurvature of the back, called roaching, might be caused by patella problems with the rear legs, which in turn causes the dog to lean forward onto the forelegs. This might also just be a structural fault with little consequence to the dog.  Due to their shortened muzzles, many Boston Terriers cannot tolerate excessively hot or cold weather and demanding exercise under such conditions can cause them harm. A sensitive digestive system is also typical of Boston Terriers with flatulence commonly being associated with poor diet in the breed.Their large and prominent eyes make Boston Terriers prone to corneal ulcers. Due to the breed being characterized by a short muzzle paired with a large pair of eyes, their eyes are susceptible to injury when making contact with sand, dust, debris, or sharp objects, such as plants with thorns.Bostons are brachycephalic breeds. The word comes from Greek roots \"Brachy,\" meaning short and \"cephalic,\" meaning head. This anatomy can cause tiny nostrils, long palates and a narrow trachea. Bostons may be prone to snoring and reverse sneeze\u2014a rapid and repeated forced inhalation through the nose\u2014accompanied by snorting or gagging sounds used to clear the palate of mucus, which does not harm the dog in any way. Brachycephalic dogs may be prone to complications with general anesthesia.\nBostons frequently require caesarean section to give birth, with over 90% of litters in a UK Kennel Club survey delivered this way.\n\n\n== Grooming ==\nWith a short, shiny, smooth coat, Boston Terriers require few grooming needs.  Bostons produce light shedding, and weekly brushing of their fine coat is effective at removing loose hair. Brushing promotes the health of the coat because it distributes skin oils, and it also encourages new hair growth. Occasional bathing is suitable for the low-maintenance breed.The nails of Boston Terriers require regular trimming. Overgrown nails not only have the potential to inflict pain on the breed, but they can also make walking difficult or tear off after getting snagged on something.Similarly to nail trimming, teeth brushing should also be done regularly to promote good oral health. The risk of the breed developing oral pain, gum infection, or bad breath can be decreased with regular teeth brushing that removes plaque buildup and other bacteria.\n\n\n== Purposes beyond companionship ==\nIn the past, Bostons were primarily pit-fighting dogs, but with their friendly and happy temperament, they became companion dogs.In modern days, aside from being an excellent companion, the Boston Terrier also excels in all sorts of canine sports.  The breed is increasingly popular in dog agility competitions, obedience training, rally obedience, tracking, dock diving, flyball, weight-pulling, barn hunt and lure coursing. Being such a versatile breed and with their outgoing personality and eagerness to meet new acquaintances, the Boston Terrier is a popular therapy dog.\n\n\n== Popular Boston Terriers ==\nIn 2012, a high school student named Victoria Reed took the advice of her veterinarian and submitted a photo of her Boston Terrier, Bruschi, to Guinness World Records. With each eye being 1.1 inches, or 28 mm, in diameter, Bruschi is recognized by Guinness to be the dog with the largest eyes.In 1921 at a ceremony to commemorate the United States' 102nd Infantry, the U.S. Army awarded a gold medal to an honorable war dog: Sergeant Stubby. The Bull Terrier, possessing three service stripes and one wound stripe, was given rank in the U.S. Army-making him the first dog to ever earn it. The comforting, protective war dog was also rewarded a medal by France. Sergeant Stubby died in 1926 with the legacy of being the United States' \"greatest war dog.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nOlde Boston Bulldogge\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBulanda, Susan (1994).

Originating in the Ardennes region these dogs were used to herd cattle. The loss of farms in the area led to serious decline in the numbers of these dogs until 1985 when some breeders found a few dogs and used the original breed standard as their guide in re-introducing the dog.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the past, all the dogs that worked with cattle were called Bouvier (bovine herder). Each region throughout the area had its own type. From ancient rough-coated stock, these dogs were prized guardians and drovers. As the motorized age arrived, the need for driving cattle to the market was gone and so was the call that helped with the drives. \nThe Bouviers were almost eliminated after the bloody fighting of World War I. Many of the rarer types were lost altogether. The breeds that are a memory include: Bouvier de Roulers, Bouvier de Moerman, and Bouvier de Paret. Still remaining are the Bouvier de Ardennes and Bouvier des Flandres.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Bouvier De Ardennes can come in any colour except white. It is usually found in brindled or peppered variety. It has medium length, coarse, wiry hair, with a \"beard\" and \"eyebrows\". This dog can be naturally short tails and long tails (both allowed, the ideal of natural short), high ears and a keen eye\n\n\n== Size ==\nThe Ardennes Cattle Dog has an ideal height for males of 55 to 63 centimetres (22 to 25 inches), and 51 to 57 centimetres (20 to 22 inches) for females. The ideal weight is 28 to 35 kilograms (62 to 77 pounds) for males with females being 22\u201328 kilograms (49\u201362 pounds).\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 92, "name": "Bouvier des Flandres", "country": "Belgium", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog92", "description": "The Bouvier des Flandres is a herding dog breed originating in Flanders, Belgium. They were originally used for general farm work including cattle droving, sheep herding, and cart pulling, and nowadays as guard dogs and police dogs, as well as being kept as pets. The French name of the breed means, literally, \"Cow Herder of Flanders\", referring to the Flemish origin of the breed. Other names for the breed are Toucheur de Boeuf (cattle driver), Vlaamse Koehond (Flemish cow dog), and Vuilbaard (dirty beard).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe monks at the Ter Duinen monastery in Flanders were among the earliest known breeders of Flanders. The bouviers bred by them are recorded as having been bred from imports such as Irish wolfhounds and Scottish deerhounds with local farm dogs, until a breed considered to be the predecessor of the modern Bouvier des Flandres was obtained. This became a working dog able to perform tirelessly, herding and guarding cattle and even pulling cargo carts, thanks to its strength and temperament, and to withstand the local weather conditions due to its thick coat.Historically, the ear cropping and tail docking could have been done for practical reasons, avoiding accidental amputations in the course of work, or to indicate the dog was working stock and not a pet subject to taxation.\n\nUp until the early 20th century, the breed was not completely defined, with three variants: Paret, Moerman or Roeselare, and Briard. Conflict between the proponents of these three variants held the breed's development back. In 1912 and 1913, several local kennel clubs recognized standards for Bouviers; however they usually had different standards for the Roeselare and other variants.World War I nearly caused the breed to disappear, due to the devastation that came over its region of origin and the fact that the dogs were used for military purposes. Indeed, Nic, a male trained as a trench dog who served during the war and was a perennial winner at dog shows after the war, is considered to be the founder of the early Bouvier des Flandres breed.A unified Bouvier des Flandres standard was created in 1936 by a joint French-Belgian committee. However, World War II again endangered the breed's existence. Due to these setbacks, progress was slowed, and it was not until 1965 that the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) breed standard, as agreed to by several minor kennel clubs, was adopted.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Bouvier is a powerfully built, compact, rough-coated dog of rugged appearance. It gives the impression of size and strength without clumsiness or heaviness. Perhaps its most notable feature is the impressive head which is accentuated by a heavy beard and mustache. Although the practice of cropping both ears and tail are now mostly cosmetic, tails were originally docked to prevent injuries caused by herding and cart-pulling. The practice of cosmetic docking is currently opposed by the American Veterinary Medical Association. In the area of origin (Flanders, Belgium) cropping was made illegal in 2006. The weight of males ranges from 80 to 120 pounds or 36 to 54 kilograms, slightly smaller for females. They are powerfully built, with a thick double coat, which can be fawn, black, grey brindle, or \"pepper and salt\" in color. Bouviers are sometimes considered non-shedding, but in fact do lose hair, like all dogs. Most of the hair that they lose is caught within the double coat which results in matting. They require weekly brushing and combing to maintain the coat. In addition to weekly brushing, the coat should be trimmed approximately every 3\u20135 weeks if it is to be a show dog. Trimming requires practice to achieve the proper look.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nBouviers des Flandres are rational, gentle, loyal, and protective by nature. The breed's particular blend of characteristics makes them good family pets, as well as keen guard dogs. Unlike some animals bred for aggressive nature and power, the Bouvier possesses sophisticated traits, such as complex control, intelligence, and accountability.\nThe Bouvier des Flandres is an obedient dog with a pleasant nature. They look intimidating, but are actually calm and gentle. They are enthusiastic, responsible, even-tempered, and fearless, and are excellent guard and watchdogs that are easy to train. This breed learns commands relatively fast. However, Bouviers get bored easily and learn best when repetition is limited.\nThey require well-balanced training that remains consistent in nature. Without being harsh, it is important to consistently make the dog aware that the owner will remain the boss. This breed needs an experienced owner to prevent dominance and over-protectiveness problems. These dogs poorly trained can become inappropriately dominant towards humans. An un-socialized Bouvier can become fearful and pose a problem when introduced to new situations in which they do not feel comfortable.\nBouviers should be socialized well, preferably starting at an early age, to avoid shyness, suspiciousness, and being overly reserved with strangers (although the breed is naturally aloof with strangers). Protection of the family when danger is present is not something that needs to be taught, nor is it something one can train out of them. The dog will rise to the occasion if needed. A good family dog, the Bouvier likes, and is excellent with, children. The Bouvier is very adaptable and goes about its business quietly and calmly. Obedience training starts when they are young. Their behavior depends on the owner's ability to communicate what is expected, and on the individual dominance level of the dog. They are usually good with other dogs if they are raised with them from puppyhood. Dominant individuals can be dog-aggressive if the owners are not assertive and do not communicate to the dog that fighting is unwanted. Slow to mature both in body and mind, the Bouvier does not fully mature until the age of 2\u20133 years.\n\n\n=== Activities ===\nBouviers des Flandres can compete in dog agility trials, carting, obedience, dog showmanship, Schutzhund, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Bouviers exhibiting basic herding instincts can then be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== Notable Bouviers des Flandres ==\n\nBelco, the dog that accompanied Edmee Bowles to America when she fled occupied Belgium and who was the foundation stud of her kennel Clos du Cereberes at Belco Farm in Pennsylvania.\nSoprano de la Thudinie, the post-war foundation stud of Justin Chastel's de la Thudinie kennel in Belgium and the most prominent ancestor of the modern type of Bouvier des Flandres.\nLucky, owned by United States President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan.\nPatrasche, the dog found by a boy named Nello in A Dog of Flanders, is often asserted to be a Bouvier des Flandres.\nMax and his mate Madchen and their puppies, fictional characters featured in W.E.B.

The coat is smooth and tight-fitting; colors are fawn or brindled, with or without white markings, and white. Boxers are brachycephalic (they have broad, short skulls), have a square muzzle, mandibular prognathism (an underbite), very strong jaws, and a powerful bite ideal for hanging on to large prey. The Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed. The purpose of the crossbreeding was the wish to eliminate the excessive white color of the breed, and the necessity of producing thousands of dogs for one of the most popular breeds in the world. The Boxer is part of the Molosser group. This group is a category of solidly built, large dog breeds that all descend from the same common ancestor, the large shepherd dog known as a Molossus. The Boxer is a member of the Working Group.The first Boxer club was founded in 1895, with Boxers being first exhibited in a dog show for St. Bernards in Munich the next year. Based on 2013 American Kennel Club statistics, Boxers held steady as the seventh-most popular breed of dog in the United States for the fourth consecutive year. However, according to the AKC's website, the boxer is now the eighth-most popular dog breed in the United States.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe head is the most distinctive feature of the Boxer. The breed standard dictates that it must be in perfect proportion to the body and above all it must never be too light. The greatest value is to be placed on the muzzle being of correct form and in absolute proportion to the skull. The length of the muzzle to the whole of the head should be a ratio of 1:3. Folds are always present from the root of the nose running downwards on both sides of the muzzle, and the tip of the nose should lie somewhat higher than the root of the muzzle. In addition a Boxer should be slightly prognathous, i.e., the lower jaw should protrude beyond the upper jaw and bend slightly upwards in what is commonly called an underbite or \"undershot bite\".Boxers were originally a docked and cropped breed, and this is still done in some countries. However, due to pressure from veterinary associations, animal rights groups, and the general public, both cropping of the ears and docking of the tail have been prohibited in many countries around the world. A line of naturally short-tailed (bobtail) Boxers was developed in the United Kingdom in anticipation of a tail docking ban there; after several generations of controlled breeding, these dogs were accepted in the Kennel Club (UK) registry in 1998, and today representatives of the bobtail line can be found in many countries around the world. However, in 2008 the FCI added a \"naturally stumpy tail\" as a disqualifying fault in their breed standard, meaning those Boxers born with a bobtail can no longer be shown in FCI member countries. In the United States and Canada as of 2012, cropped ears are still more common in show dogs, even though the practice of cosmetic cropping is currently opposed by the American Veterinary Medical Association. In March 2005 the AKC breed standard was changed to include a description of the uncropped ear, but to severely penalize an undocked tail. The tail of a boxer is typically docked before the cartilage is fully formed, between 3\u20135 days old. This procedure does not require any anesthesia or sutures when performed at this young age.\n\n\n=== Coat and colors ===\nThe Boxer is a short-haired breed, with a shiny, smooth coat that lies tight to the body. The recognized colors are fawn and brindle, frequently with a white underbelly and white on the feet. These white markings, called flash, often extend onto the neck or face, and dogs that have these markings are known as \"flashy\". \"Fawn\" denotes a range of color, the tones of which may be described variously as light tan or yellow, reddish tan, mahogany or stag/deer red, and dark honey-blonde. In the UK and Europe, fawn Boxers are typically rich in color and are often called \"red\". \"Brindle\" refers to a dog with black stripes on a fawn background. Some brindle Boxers are so heavily striped that they give the appearance of \"reverse brindling\", fawn stripes on a black body; these dogs are conventionally called \"reverse brindles\", but that is actually a misnomer\u2014they are still fawn dogs with black stripes. In addition, the breed standards state that the fawn background must clearly contrast with or show through the brindling.\nThe Boxer does not carry the gene for a solid black coat color and therefore purebred black Boxers do not exist.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== White Boxers ===\nBoxers with white markings covering more than one-third of their coat \u2013 conventionally called \"white\" Boxers \u2013 are neither albino nor rare; approximately 20\u201325% of all Boxers born are white.  Genetically, these dogs are either fawn or brindle, with excessive white markings overlying the base coat color. Like fair-skinned humans, white Boxers have a higher risk of sunburn and associated skin cancers than colored Boxers. The extreme piebald gene, which is responsible for white markings in Boxers, is linked to congenital sensorineural deafness in dogs. It is estimated that about 18% of white Boxers are deaf in one or both ears, though Boxer rescue organizations see about double that number.In the past, breeders often euthanized white puppies at birth. A 1998 study of Boxers in the Netherlands showed that 17% of Boxer pups were euthanized because they were white. Previously, the American Boxer Club \"unofficially recommended euthanasia for these animals.\" Reasons for euthanizing white pups includes the view that it is unethical to sell a dog with \"faults\" and the perception that white Boxers are at higher risk of ending up abandoned in rescues. Today, breeders are increasingly reluctant to euthanize healthy pups and may choose to neuter and place them in pet homes instead.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n The character of the Boxer is of the greatest importance and demands the most solicitous attention. He is renowned from olden times for his great love and faithfulness to his master and household. He is harmless in the family, but can be distrustful of strangers, bright and friendly of temperament at play, but brave and determined when aroused. His intelligence and willing tractability, his modesty and cleanliness make him a highly desirable family dog and cheerful companion. He is the soul of honesty and loyalty, and is never false or treacherous even in his old age. \n\nBoxers are a bright, energetic and playful breed and tend to be very good with children. They are patient and spirited with children but also protective, making them a popular choice for families. They are active, strong dogs and require adequate exercise to prevent boredom-associated behaviors such as chewing, digging, or licking. Boxers have earned a slight reputation of being \"headstrong,\" which can be related to inappropriate obedience training. Owing to their intelligence and working breed characteristics, training based on corrections often has limited usefulness. Boxers, like other animals, typically respond better to positive reinforcement techniques such as clicker training, an approach based on operant conditioning and behaviorism, which offers the dog an opportunity to think independently and to problem-solve. Stanley Coren's survey of obedience trainers, summarized in his book The Intelligence of Dogs, ranked Boxers at #48 \u2013 average working/obedience intelligence. Many who have worked with Boxers disagree quite strongly with Coren's survey results, and maintain that a skilled trainer who uses reward-based methods will find Boxers have far above-average intelligence and working ability.The Boxer by nature is not an aggressive or vicious breed. It is an instinctive guardian and can become very attached to its family. Like all dogs, it requires proper socialization. Boxers are generally patient with smaller dogs and puppies, but difficulties with larger adult dogs, especially those of the same sex, may occur. Boxers are generally more comfortable with companionship, in either human or canine form.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Boxer is part of the Molosser dog group, developed in Germany in the late 19th century from the now extinct Bullenbeisser, a dog of Mastiff descent, and Bulldogs brought in from Great Britain. The Bullenbeisser had been working as a hunting dog for centuries, employed in the pursuit of bear, wild boar, and deer. Its task was to seize the prey and hold it until the hunters arrived. In later years, faster dogs were favored and a smaller Bullenbeisser was bred in Brabant, in northern Belgium. It is generally accepted that the Brabanter Bullenbeisser was a direct ancestor of today's Boxer.\nIn 1894, three Germans by the names of Friedrich Robert, Elard K\u00f6nig, and R. H\u00f6pner decided to stabilize the breed and put it on exhibition at a dog show. This was done in Munich in 1896, and the year before they founded the first Boxer Club, the Deutscher Boxer Club. The Club went on to publish the first Boxer breed standard in 1904, a detailed document that has not been changed much to this day.\n\nThe breed was introduced to other parts of Europe in the late 19th century and to the United States around the turn of the 20th century. The American Kennel Club (AKC) registered the first Boxer in 1904, and recognized the first Boxer champion, Dampf vom Dom, in 1915. During World War I, the Boxer was co-opted for military work, acting as a valuable messenger dog, pack-carrier, attack dog, and guard dog. It was not until after World War II that the Boxer became popular around the world. Taken home by returning soldiers, they introduced the dog to a wider audience and soon became a favorite as a companion, a show dog, and a guard dog.\n\n\n=== Early genealogy ===\n\nThe German citizen George Alt, a Munich resident, mated a brindle-colored female dog imported from France named Flora with a local dog of unknown ancestry, known simply as \"Boxer\", resulting in a fawn-and-white male, named \"Lechner's Box\" after its owner.  This dog was mated with his own dam Flora, and one of its offspring was a female dog called Alt's Schecken. George Alt mated Schecken with a Bulldog named Dr. Toneissen's Tom to produce the historically significant dog M\u00fchlbauer's Flocki. Flocki was the first Boxer to enter the German Stud Book after winning the aforementioned show for St. Bernards in Munich 1896, which was the first event to have a class specific for Boxers.The white female dog Ch. Blanka von Angertor, Flocki's sister, was even more influential when mated with Piccolo von Angertor (Lechner's Box grandson) to produce the predominantly white (parti-colored) female dog Meta von der Passage, which, even bearing little resemblance with the modern Boxer standard (early photographs depict her as too long, weak-backed and down-faced), is considered the mother of the breed. John Wagner, in The Boxer (first published in 1939) said the following regarding this female dog:\n Meta von der Passage played the most important role of the five original ancestors. Our great line of sires all trace directly back to this female. She was a substantially built, low to the ground, brindle and white parti-color, lacking in underjaw and exceedingly lippy. As a producing female few in any breed can match her record. She consistently whelped puppies of marvelous type and rare quality. Those of her offspring sired by Flock St. Salvator and Wotan dominate all present-day pedigrees. Combined with Wotan and Mirzl children, they made the Boxer. \n\n\n=== Breed name ===\n\nThe name \"Boxer\" is supposedly derived from the breed's tendency to play by standing on its hind legs and \"boxing\" with its front paws. According to Andrew H. Brace's Pet owner's guide to the Boxer, this theory is the least plausible explanation. He claims \"it's unlikely that a nation so permeated with nationalism would give to one of its most famous breeds a name so obviously anglicised\".\nGerman linguistic and historical evidence find the earliest written source for the word Boxer in the 18th century, where it is found in a text in the Deutsches Fremdw\u00f6rterbuch (The German Dictionary of Foreign Words), which cites an author named Mus\u00e4us of 1782 writing \"da\u00df er aus Furcht vor dem gro\u00dfen Baxer Salmonet ... sich auf einige Tage in ein ger\u00e4umiges Packfa\u00df ... absentiret hatte\". At that time the spelling \"baxer\" equalled \"boxer\". Both the verb (boxen [English \"to box, to punch, to jab\"]) and the noun (Boxer) were common German words as early as the late 18th century. The term Boxl, also written Buxn or Buchsen in the Bavarian dialect, means \"short (leather) trousers\" or \"underwear\". The very similar-sounding term Boxerl, also from the Bavarian dialect, is an endearing term for Boxer. More in line with historical facts, Brace states that there exist many other theories to explain the origin of the breed name, from which he favors the one claiming the smaller Bullenbeisser (Brabanter) were also known as \"Boxl\" and that Boxer is just a corruption of that word.In the same vein runs a theory based on the fact that there were a group of dogs known as Bierboxer in Munich by the time of the breed's development. These dogs were the result from mixes of Bullenbeisser and other similar breeds. Bier (beer) probably refers to the Biergarten, the typical Munich beergarden, an open-air restaurant where people used to take their dogs along. The nickname \"Deutscher Boxer\" was derived from bierboxer and Boxer could also be a corruption of the former or a contraction of the latter.A passage from the book \"The Complete Boxer\" by Milo G Denlinger states:\n\n It has been claimed that the name \"Boxer\" was jokingly applied by an English traveler who noted a tendency of the dog to use its paws in fighting. This seems improbable. Any such action would likely result in a badly bitten if not broken leg. On the other hand, a German breeder of forty years' experience states positively that the Boxer does not use his feet, except to try and extinguish a small flame such as a burning match. But a Boxer does box with his head. He will hit (not bite) a cat with his muzzle hard enough to knock it out and he will box a ball with his nose. Or perhaps, since the German dictionary translates 'boxer' as 'prize-fighter' the name was bestowed in appreciation of the fighting qualities of the breed rather than its technique. \n\nBoxer is also the name of a dog owned by John Peerybingle, the main character in the best-selling 1845 book The Cricket on the Hearth by Charles Dickens, which is evidence that \"Boxer\" was commonly used as a dog name by the early 19th century, before the establishment of the breed by the end of that same century.\nThe name of the breed could also be simply due to the names of the very first known specimens of the breed (Lechner's Box, for instance).\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nLeading health issues to which Boxers are prone include cancers, heart conditions such as aortic stenosis and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (the so-called \"Boxer cardiomyopathy\"), hypothyroidism, hip dysplasia, and degenerative myelopathy and epilepsy; other conditions that may be seen are gastric dilatation volvulus (also known as bloat), intestinal problems, and allergies (although these may be more related to diet than breed). Entropion, a malformation of the eyelid requiring surgical correction, is occasionally seen, and some lines have a tendency toward spondylosis deformans, a fusing of the spine, or dystocia. Other conditions that are less common but occur more often in Boxers than other breeds are hystiocytic ulcerative colitis (sometimes called Boxer colitis), an invasive E. coli infection, and indolent corneal ulcers, often called Boxer eye ulcers.\nAbout 22% of puppies die before reaching 7 weeks of age.  Stillbirth is the most frequent cause of death, followed by infection.  Mortality due to infection increases significantly with increases in inbreeding.According to a UK Kennel Club health survey, cancer accounts for 38.5% of Boxer deaths, followed by old age (21.5%), cardiac (6.9%) and gastrointestinal (6.9%) related issues. The breed is particularly predisposed to mast cell tumours, a cancer of the immune system. Median lifespan was 10.25 years. Responsible breeders use available tests to screen their breeding stock before breeding, and in some cases throughout the life of the dog, in an attempt to minimize the occurrence of these diseases in future generations.Boxers are known to be very sensitive to the hypotensive and bradycardiac effects of a commonly used veterinary sedative, acepromazine. It is recommended that the drug be avoided in the Boxer breed.As an athletic breed, proper exercise and conditioning is important for the continued health and longevity of the Boxer. Care must be taken not to over-exercise young dogs, as this may damage growing bones; however, once mature, Boxers can be excellent jogging or running companions. Because of their brachycephalic head, they do not do well with high heat or humidity, and common sense should prevail when exercising a Boxer in these conditions.\n\n\n== Nutrition ==\n\nBoxer are very energetic even at old ages. They need plenty of exercise which means their diet should be high in quality calories. The main source of these calories should be lean animal protein, which include lean chicken, turkey, lamb and fish. While on a high calorie diet, owners should be thoughtful of the amount of treats given as this tends to cause obesity. Owners should be mindful of the food to snack ratio being consumed by the Boxer when determining how many treats are acceptable. Some healthy snacks include raw fruits and vegetables.Boxers are also prone to dental problems, increasing their susceptibility for bad breath; dry dog food that is large and difficult for them to chew improves the likelihood for plaque removal. Plaque can also be removed by crude fiber in kibble, which has a flexible structure that increases chewing time. Polyphosphates are often coated on the outside of dry dog food, which further reduce plaque buildup by preventing calcium production in saliva.  Odor production from the boxer's mouth is likely to be reduced if its teeth and oral cavity are kept in healthy conditions.\n\n\n== Uses ==\n\nBoxers are friendly, lively companions that are popular as family dogs. Their suspicion of strangers, alertness, agility, and strength make them formidable guard dogs. As puppies, Boxers demonstrate a fascinating combination of mood-mirroring expressions, energetic curiosity, flexible attention spans and charming characteristics. They sometimes appear at dog agility or dog obedience trials and flyball events. These strong and intelligent animals have also been used as service dogs, guide dogs for the blind, therapy dogs, police dogs in K9 units, and occasionally herding cattle or sheep. The versatility of Boxers was recognized early on by the military, which has used them as valuable messenger dogs, pack carriers, and attack and guard dogs in times of war.\n\n\n== Notable Boxers ==\nPunch and Judy, awarded the Dickin Medal for conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving in military conflict.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nBoxer at Curlie"}, {"id": 94, "name": "Boykin Spaniel", "country": "United States", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog94", "description": "The Boykin Spaniel is a medium-sized breed of dog, a Spaniel bred for hunting wild turkeys and ducks in the Wateree River Swamp of South Carolina, in the United States. It is the state dog of South Carolina, where it was discovered and further developed by hunters in the 1900s. 1 September is Boykin Spaniel Day in South Carolina.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Boykin Spaniel is only slightly larger than the English Cocker Spaniel but much heavier through the body width. Height at the withers for males ranges from 15.5\u201317 in (39\u201343 cm) and weight 30\u201340 lb (14\u201318 kg). Females are smaller, 14\u201316.5 in (36\u201342 cm) and 25\u201335 lb (11\u201316 kg). Buyers should be aware of the size and weight in the puppy's pedigree before choosing a breeder if size is a factor in their choice of dog. Traditionally, its tail is docked at the age of three days, leaving 1/3 length. Eyes are engaging and bright. The color ranges from brilliant gold to a dark amber. Puppies will have milky bluish-gold to amber eyes until a few months old. The coat color comes in liver or chocolate (shades of brown.)\nCoat length and density vary widely due to the variety of breeds that make up the recent background of this breed. The coat is flat to moderately curly with medium length, fine hair with light feathering acceptable on the legs, feet, ears, chest, and belly. Length is normally 1-2 inches throughout the body. A few bloodlines throw shorter, straight coats much like a Labrador Retriever. Feathering on the ears, chest, through the tuck-up and along the legs can be very little to moderate in density and length. Feathering may take on a sun-bleached golden to tawny color especially on the ears and should not be penalized. Groomed dogs should have a minimal of stripping or clipping, with slight shaping around the head and topline. Some individuals have a topknot like a Llewellin Setter. Field types are often shaved down and should not be penalized as long as it is of appropriate length to protect the skin. Improper shaving will result in some coats growing back in with excessive discoloration, fading or graying. White markings other than a mark on the chest, or a white mark on the chest that is more than 60% of the width of the chest, disqualify puppies from being registered with the Boykin Spaniel Society, although the American Kennel Club and United Kennel Club do not allow denial of registration for conformation reasons. White on the toes or chest is purely a cosmetic trait and will not affect the ability or health of the dog.\n\n\n== Hunting use ==\nThe Boykin Spaniel is a versatile hunter, working as a retriever and upland hunter, flushing birds into flight. Pointing is not in character with the Boykin's hunting style, but many confuse the inherent characteristic of a \"hesitant flush\" with pointing. Of the six or eight different breeds used to create the current breed, three are pointing breeds for this reason. The field Boykin spaniel wants to be 100% precise when she flushes her bird, and as a dutiful partner she knows to wait until her hunter is positioned for the shot. Their stamina in hot weather and eagerness make them good for dove hunts, but also for pheasant and other upland game. They can be used in driving deer or in tracking wounded game. Their small size makes them easy to carry in a canoe or other small boat, and they are described as \"the dog that doesn't rock the boat.\"  However, an unacceptably high percentage of Boykin spaniels are not able to internally produce the proteins necessary to keep their muscles working during sustained work in warm temperatures, and can be fatal. As of 2017, Exercise Induced Collapse syndrome appears in about 10% of all Boykin spaniels due to inattentive breeding practices. Screening for the presence of the gene which causes EIC is done by simple DNA sample collection and analysis.  Prospective buyers of Boykin spaniel puppies are advised to obtain verified proof of DNA testing from all breeders before buying.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Boykin Spaniel is a friendly, social dog that is considered a good family pet. It is easily trained and eager to work. It is good with, and extremely stable around children and other dogs. They can sometimes be described as energetic with great endurance. They are extremely adaptable to different environments as long as they are given ample opportunity for social interaction and plenty of time to burn off excess energy reserves. They are not easily angered and tend to be eager to please and friendly, but they love attention.\n\n\n== Care ==\nAs with all dogs, the Boykin Spaniels require daily exercise and regular grooming. Clipping the coat regularly is recommended especially if the dog is in the field, as the soft coat collects foxtails and briars. Spraying the dog with cooking spray is also recommended to help defend against tangles in the long fur.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first Boykin Spaniel, or the precursor of today's breed, was reportedly a small, stray spaniel type dog that befriended a banker walking from his home to the First Presbyterian Church in Spartanburg, South Carolina around 1900. Alexander L. White (1860-1942) liked the little dog and took it home. After the dog showed some aptitude for retrieving, White sent the dog called \"Dumpy\" to his longtime friend and hunting partner Lemuel Whitaker Boykin near Camden, South Carolina.  \"Whit\" Boykin (1861\u20131932) experimented with crossbreeding different breeds, and the resulting dog is named after him. This breed is only one of two US-made breeds named for the family responsible for their creation. In Boykin's hands the little stray developed into a superb turkey dog and waterfowl retriever. This dog became the foundation stock for the Boykin spaniel. The dogs had to be small enough to ride in the small boats used by hunters in the swamps. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever, Springer Spaniel, Cocker Spaniel, American Water Spaniel and various pointing breeds were used in the development of the breed, according to Whit Boykin's grandson Dr. Baynard Boykin. The area in which the breed developed, around Camden, South Carolina, was a resort and hunting area, and the breed was noticed by visitors and so spread around the United States.  In 1977 the Boykin Spaniel Society\u00ae was formed by the Boykin family and began maintaining a studbook  in 1979. The BSS studbook has been \"closed\" since 1980, meaning that only dogs from BSS registered parents may be registered with the BSS.\nThe Boykin Spaniel was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1985. UKC does not close its studbooks so dogs from the BSS or the AKC may be registered into the UKC studbook at any time. In the 1990s a group of fanciers formed the Boykin Spaniel Club And Breeders Association of America in order to achieve AKC recognition of the breed and to gain access to the AKC Spaniel Hunt Tests held throughout the nation.  In 2007 the Boykin Spaniel Club And Breeders Association of America was recognized by the AKC as the parent club for the breed.In January 2006 the breed became eligible to compete in AKC Spaniel Hunt tests for official AKC titles. In July 2006 the Boykin Spaniel was eligible to earn AKC titles in AKC agility, tracking, rally obedience, and regular obedience.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nAccording to statistics developed and maintained by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) since 1985, adult Boykin Spaniels have an alarmingly high incidence rate (> 30%) of hip dysplasia, although the rate is declining in the past 7 years due to the emphasis placed by the Boykin Spaniel Foundation. Canine hip dysplasia is considered by scientists to be both hereditary and acquired (due to diet, too strenuous exercise, spay/neuter.)\nThe breed also has a susceptibility toward inherited heart disease, eye disease and patella luxation.   Skin and coat problems do exist and may be linked to thyroid or endocrine disorders; most, however, are due to mites and other vermin which are acquired as puppies when raised in unsanitary conditions. Elbow dysplasia, Cushing's disease and hypothyroidism are known in the breed.\nIn early 2010 exercise-induced collapse was positively identified in the breed by the University of Minnesota's Veterinary Diagnostics Laboratory. In 2013, the Boykin Spaniel Foundation in conjunction with Cornell University's Optigen laboratory did a random sampling of 180+ adult Boykin spaniels for Collie Eye Anomaly, an inherited disease of the eye which causes malformation of eye components and impaired vision, including partial-to-full blindness. A year later, the Boykin Spaniel Foundation did another 180-dog random sample for Degenerative Myelopathy, another inheritable disease which causes adult dogs to develop gradual, fatal deterioration of the spinal cord and results in death when the afflicted dogs are middle age. DNA testing of these three autosomal recessive diseases can absolutely identify genetic carriers (one copy of the gene) and at-risk (2 copies of the gene) individuals.\nBefore being used for breeding dogs should be tested for hips, hereditary eye disease, and heart/cardiac (specifically pulmonary stenosis), hereditary patella luxation, and hereditary exercise-induced collapse, DM and CEA. Eye examinations should be done annually.\n\n\n== References ==\nBoykin Spaniel dog breed.\n\n\n== External links ==\nBoykin Spaniel at Curlie"}, {"id": 95, "name": "Bracco Italiano", "country": "Italy", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog95", "description": "The Bracco Italiano [\u02c8brakko ita\u02c8lja\u02d0no] is a breed of dog developed in Italy as a versatile gun dog.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Bracco - or Italian Pointer- should be athletic and powerful in appearance, most resembling a cross between a German Shorthaired Pointer and a Bloodhound, although it is nothing like them in character.   It has pendulous upper lips and long ears that create a serious expression. It should be \"almost square\", meaning that its height at the withers should be almost the same as the length of its body.  It should not however be actually square as this would render its famous rear driving push off and front/rear extension to be compromised, thus losing much of its powerful grace. The tail has historically been docked, mostly due to the strong possibility of injury in rough/dense terrain when hunting, however there has been a sea-change in the European Union, with some now working the breed with full tail.\n\n\n=== Coat and colour ===\n\nThe coat is short, dense, and glossy. The texture should be fairly hard, though somewhat shorter and softer on the head, throat, ears, legs, and feet.  Shedding happens a couple of times a year, and a hound glove really helps in removing dead coat.\nThe most common colours are Bianco-Arancio - White-Orange and Roano-Marrone - Roano-Brown, chestnut, or amber coloured patches on the face, ears, base of tail, and body.\nBlack on the coat is a fault, as are \"three-color\" dogs, such as orange/white with chestnut spottings above the eyes, on the muzzle and legs, such as the pattern of a Doberman or Rottweiler.\nweight is 25\u201340 kilograms (55\u201388 lb).\n\n\n=== Movement ===\nThe gait, when hunting, starts out as a gallop, but slows to a long trot as the dog comes into scent.  This trot should be long and fluid, with plenty of reach and drive (the 'almost square' body contributes to this).  As a Bracco comes closer and closer to scent, the gait slows to a creep, and settles into a  \"point\", with a front leg usually held up in the classic pointing dog position.  The point may be held (no movement) or the dog can \"creep\" along with the bird's movement - especially convenient with birds that run, like the pheasant.  Either is acceptable in Italy.  The head should be held above the topline, which facilitates the air scenting for which this breed is known.  A well-built Bracco, with a full and developed musculature covering, is an attractive mover and covers a lot of ground.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nBraccos are very much a people-loving dog and thrive on human companionship, having a strong need to be close to their people.  They are a particularly good family dog, and many have a strong love of children.  They get along well with other dogs and pets, if trained to do so - it is, afterall, a hunting breed - and must be taught what to chase and what not to.  They are very willing to please as long as they have decided that your idea is better than theirs.   Obedience training is a must for a Bracco, and the more is asked of them, the better they do.  Harsh reprimands do not work with this breed unless the reprimand is a fair one - and harshness must occasionally be used with some dogs to remind them who is actually in charge.  Although not an aggressive breed, many Braccos will alert if there is a reason, and some will bark or growl if there's a good reason.\nThe breed loves to hunt, and they excel at it - in fact, a non-hunting Bracco is not a happy Bracco, and will act out in various other ways.  Hunting without a gun  is an area in which the Bracco can excel and this can be a great opportunity for training the dog to connect with the owner.  They are an active breed, but require more mental exercise than physical exercise to keep them happy.  A Bracco owner can teach games like hide-and-seek (an object or person) which fits into the breed's original and current usage, and keeps them mentally active.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Bracco Italiano originated in Italy, and there are writings concerning the breed that date back to the 4th and 5th centuries BC.  It is believed to be a cross between a Segugio Italiano (a coursing hound) and the Asiatic Mastiff. Others claim the breed goes back to the St. Hubert Hound. Undoubtedly, both hounds and gundogs are in the breed's ancestry for there was an old practice of mating these together to produce a dog capable of pointing, but with more stamina.There are two variations of the breed. The first originated in Piedmont, and was for that reason known as the Piedmontese Pointer. The other originated in Lombardy, and was known as the Lombard Pointer. The Bracco from Piedmont is lighter in color and build than the Lombard variety, probably due to the mountainous terrain there. It was well established by the Middle Ages. The Bracco thrived during the Renaissance and was bred by both the Medici and Gonzaga families.\nThey were sought out by the aristocracy and used to hunt feathered game. At the end of the 19th century and the early 20th century the breed nearly became extinct. Later, it was saved primarily by the combined efforts of the Italian breeder Ferdinando Delor de Ferrabouc and - during the later World Wars - of a few staunch Italian breeders whose families had already dedicated themselves to the Bracco over several centuries.The Italian standard for the breed was released in 1949 from the S.A.B.I. (Societ\u00e1 Amatori Bracco Italiano) in Lodi, Lombardy. It came to England in 1989.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPointing breed\nSpinone Italiano\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBracco Italiano at Curlie"}, {"id": 96, "name": "Braque d'Auvergne", "country": "France", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog96", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 97, "name": "Braque du Bourbonnais", "country": "France", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog97", "description": "The Braque du Bourbonnais is a breed of gundog, of rustic appearance, sometimes born with a short tail, with a coat ticked with liver or fawn.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nIt had been described for the first time during the Renaissance (Natural History from Aldrovandi, Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Paris).\nIn danger of disappearing, it thrived again after World War I with the creation of the first club, in 1925.\n\n\n=== Disappearance ===\nAfter World War II, the number of births decreased and the club became less active until it ceased to function. From 1963 to 1973, there were no dogs registered in the LOF (French studbook). The reason for this is probably a selection on secondary characteristics (color of the coat, short tail) instead of the hunting capabilities and general construction of the dog; this led to have a Bourbonnais less suitable for hunting than other breeds.\n\n\n=== Recreation ===\nIn 1970, Michel Comte decided to look for the last dog that had some Bourbonnais blood. He found only mixed breed dogs, which had some characteristics of the Braque du Bourbonnais (size, shape of the head, short tail). After some more or less inbred litters, he registered his first Bourbonnais on the LOF (under Titre Initial procedure) in 1973, 1974, and 1975; from then, several breeders joined him, who, from those dogs, created their own lines, and the number of births increased.,In 1981, the Club du Braque du Bourbonnais was recreated. Michel Comte was its president until 2001. From this moment, the successes of the Bourbonnais in field trials made the breed thrive.\nIn 1988, the first Bourbonnais was introduced in the USA. Since then the breed has been growing in that country, which became the second producer of Bourbonnais pointers after France.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\n\n==== Head ====\nRounded in every direction, with lateral sides rounded, with parietal bones and zygomatic arches well developed. The axes of the skull and muzzle are parallel, or slightly divergent towards the front.\n\n\n==== Coat ====\nTwo coat colors exist in the Bourbonnais, each of them having specific name because the color is specific to the breed:\n-Liver, also called \u00ab wine dregs \u00bb or \u00ab faded lilac \u00bb.\n-Fawn, also called \u00ab peach blossom \u00bb.\nBig spots are tolerated on the body if they are not bigger than the palm of a hand. On the head, the two eyes must not be inside the same spot.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Differences sire/Female ====\nThe females are generally thinner, more elegant and longer than the sires (see pictures above).\n\n\n==== Short tail ====\nIn the past called \"short-tail pointer\", the braque du Bourbonnais is sometimes born with a short tail (brachyury) or no tail at all (anury).\nThe gene responsible for this characteristic has been identified as being the same as the Brittany Spaniel one, of autosomal dominant type.\n\n\n==== Head position ====\nHigh or prolonging the shoulder.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThey have  a good temper and can be a good agreement dog. But it is mostly a hunter. It is a continental dog, and must be judged as such.\n\n\n==== Allure and style ====\nThey show a lot of activity, even if he does not go very far. Their natural pace is gallop, but under cover he can use trot. They can change direction quickly, like polo. \n\n\n=== Pointing ===\nThey must point with authority, in a classical position.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFull genealogy, standards, photos, drawings, and genetics of the breed"}, {"id": 98, "name": "Braque du Puy", "country": "France", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog98", "description": "The Braque du Puy was an old breed of hunting dog in France, bred for hunting in the lowlands and known for being fast and flexible. The breed was created in Poitou in the 19th century by crossing other Braques with greyhound-type dogs. One story is that two brothers named du Puy crossed their Braque Francais dog with a Sloughi brought back from Africa by a French soldier.\nColour of the Braque du Puy was white with orange or liver coloured marks, and was a medium to large size. The breed has now either died out or has died out in its original form, although the type may be reconstituted from other breeds and called Braque du Puy (or variants of the name) for the rare breed pet market in various parts of the world. The Braque du Puy was known for its refined, sight hound-like appearance and its skill as a hunting companion. The Braque du Puy was relatively popular at one point although it never achieved the numbers or fame of some other French Braques. The Braque du Puy is now generally considered extinct, although a few fanciers insist that the breed continues to exist in remote regions of Europe, and Braque du Puys are even occasionally offered for sale through rare breed dealers although these dogs are likely recreations rather than the original breed. The Braque du Puy is also known as the Braque Dupuy, the Dupuy Pointer, and the Du Puy Pointer.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBraque de l'Ari\u00e8ge (Ariege Pointing Dog)\nBraque d'Auvergne (Auvergne Pointing Dog)\nBraque du Bourbonnais (Bourbonnais Pointing Dog)\nBraque Francais, type Gascogne (French Pointing Dog - Gascogne type)\nBraque Francais, type Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es (French Pointing Dog - Pyrenean type)\nBraque Saint-Germain (St. Germain Pointing Dog)\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 99, "name": "Braque Francais", "country": "France", "type": "Gun Dog (Grande Taille, Petite Taille)", "picture": "dog99", "description": "The Braques fran\u00e7ais are hunting dogs, from a very old type of gun dog used for pointing the location of game birds for a hunter. There are two breeds of Braque fran\u00e7ais, both from the south of France,  the Braque fran\u00e7ais, type Gascogne  (French Pointing Dog - Gascogne type, larger size) and the Braque fran\u00e7ais, type Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es (French Pointing Dog - Pyrenean type, smaller size) They are popular hunting dogs in France, but are seldom seen elsewhere.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe original Braque fran\u00e7ais type of pointing dog has existed since the fifteenth century. Over the centuries the dogs were taken to other countries and were crossed with other breeds. When a search was made at the end of the nineteenth century to find the original dogs, two separate regional varieties were found. They may be descended from the Old Spanish Pointer or Pachon Navarro, and the now extinct Southern Hound.\nThe first breed club was formed in 1850, and the standards for both breeds were written in 1880. It is recognised in its home country by the French Kennel Club (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine, S.C.C) and internationally by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale. The S.C.C. prohibits inbreeding or linebreeding and will not register any dog with common ancestors in the first three generations of its pedigree. Of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world, only the Canadian Kennel Club in Canada and the United Kennel Club in the U.S. recognise them. The Canadian Kennel Club recognises one breed, the Braque Fran\u00e7ais (Gascogne) in its Sporting Dogs Group and the United Kennel Club recognises both breeds, in its Gundog Group, with the names Braque Francais De Grande Taille and Braque Francais, De Petite Taille - petite taille (smaller size) means the Pyrenean is smaller than the Gascogne, and does not mean that it is a little dog. The breeds are also recognized by many minor registries, hunting clubs, and internet-based dog registry businesses under various versions of the names, and promoted as rare breeds for those seeking unique pets.\n\n\n== Hunting use ==\nThe Braque fran\u00e7ais breeds are not just pointers, but versatile hunting dogs that can retrieve, flush, and even trail game in all sorts of terrain. The Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es is a quick dog that can move fast without sprinting, while the Gascogne is a slower moving dog.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nBoth breeds of Braque fran\u00e7ais are medium to large sized dogs with long legs and long drop ears. The coat is short, and chestnut brown or white speckled with brown in colour, often with one or more large brown spots. The head is usually brown.  The Gascogne is about 10 centimetres (3.9 in) taller at the withers than the Pyrenean.\n\n\n=== Differences ===\nThe Braque fran\u00e7ais, type Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es dogs are 47\u201358 centimetres (19\u201323 in) at the withers, females slightly smaller), giving the impression of \"a German shorthaired pointer shrunk down to Brittany size\". The larger Braque fran\u00e7ais, type Gascogne dogs are 58\u201369 centimetres (23\u201327 in) (females smaller)\nThe coat of the Gascogne is thick, while that of the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es is described as \"finer and shorter\" than the Gascogne. The Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es is usually more mottled brown on the body.\nThe head of the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es is slightly broader, and the ears are not as long. On the Gascogne, if the ears are pulled forward, they will reach the tip of the nose. The Gascogne has slightly pendulous lips, making the muzzle appear square; the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es muzzle looks more narrow.Faults (elements of appearance that indicate that the dog should not be bred) in both breeds include no tail (anury), split nose or depigmented nose, syndactyly (toes grown together), surplus toes, or absence of toes.\n\n\n== Health ==\nNo specific diseases or claims of extraordinary health have been documented for this breed.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nIdeal Braque Francais temperament is described as \"friendly, sociable, gentle and submissive\" and, as a soft breed, should not be subjected to harsh training methods. Temperament of individual dogs can vary, and all dogs must be well socialized with people and other animals at an early age in order to be a good pet.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBraque d'Ari\u00e8ge\nBraque d'Auvergne\nBraque du Bourbonnais\nBraque du Puy\nBraque Saint-Germain\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nThe Encyclopedia of the Dog by Bruce Fogle, D.V.M.

It is neither recognized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) nor the American Kennel Club (AKC). However, it has the official brazilian recognition of the CBKC(Brazilian Confederation of Cynophilia) where it belongs to the Group  11 - Breeds not recognized by the FCI.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe original developer of the breed was a Bull Terrier breeder Pedro Pessoa Ribeiro Dantas from Caxias do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul. In 1978, his neighbor asked him to cross one of his Bull Terrier males with the neighbor's female Boxer. Pedro took one of the female puppies from this mating, and named her Tigresa after the brindle markings on her coat. As Tigresa grew, she turned out to be a very pleasant and promising individual: she was extremely affectionate, obedient, quick-to-learn, physically balanced, strong, and vigorous. Moreover, she lacked the extreme characteristics typical to the modern Bull Terrier, being much more functional and agile. She was also physically stronger than both an average Bull Terrier and an average Boxer. At the same time she was an excellent guard and very tolerant towards Pedro's Bull Terriers: when they tried to provoke her, she rather eluded the attacks by her better physical agility and balance than by using aggression.\nAfter noticing the great qualities of Tigresa, Pedro started to gather information from other people who had purchased a puppy from the same litter. The response was that the dogs had become physically vigorous and excellent guards, at the same time being gentle and affectionate towards their families. Therefore, another mating between a different Bull Terrier and a Boxer. Because the results turned out to be as positive as in the first litter, a new breeding line was decided to be established and was originally named Bull Boxer (which should not be confused with the English designer breed with the same name based on a Staffordshire Bull Terrier x Boxer cross).\nAfter the first generation of Bull Terrier x Boxer crosses consisting of 80 individuals, Pedro continued by occasional matings between these crosses. The qualities and health of the new puppies were followed during their growth. It was noticed that a vast majority of them possessed the following characteristics:\nExtremely efficient guardian\nBalanced temper and extremely attached to his family\nPhysically balanced and powerful, with the extreme pain tolerance of the Bull Terrier\nLongevity, lifespan being approximately 13 yearsAlthough the results were promising, Pedro was not yet sure if the same results could also be achieved by using other similar kinds of breeds. Therefore, he crossed several Bull Boxers with the American Staffordshire Terrier and noticed that at least in the first generation, the characteristics remained the same. However, no more American Bull Terrier crosses were made in the following generations and soon the studbook was closed in order to continue the breeding solely by using already existing Bull Boxers.\nThe Brazilian Bull Boxer Club was founded in 1986 and its president is Pedro Ribeiro Dantas himself. The breed was officially accepted by the CBKC in 1999 and the today's version of the breed standard was published in 2007. Nowadays there are 2000 pure-bred dogs in the official registry of the Bull Boxer Club - however, the number also includes many dogs that have already died. There are breeders in many different states of Brazil and the breed has grown popularity since the 1990s. Although the Brazilian Dogo is not recognized by the FCI, it does not bother Brazilian breeders and fanciers of the breed: actually, the president of the Bull Boxer Club has stated that the FCI's current principles do not meet with the breeding philosophy of the Dogue Brasileiro.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Brazilian Dogo represents the Dogo subtype of Molossers. It is a medium-sized, strong, agile and muscular dog, being massive without creating heavy or stocky impression. Males are 54 \u2013 60 cm tall (ideal height 58 cm) and weigh 29 \u2013 43 kg (ideal weight 39 kg); females 50 \u2013 58 cm tall (ideal height 56 cm) and weigh 23 \u2013 39 kg (ideal weight 33 kg). The breed is therefore lighter and athletic, which is equally tall but significantly heavier. There are two coat variants: short (less than 2.5 cm) and medium-length (from 2.5 to 4.7 cm). The texture of the shiny coat is harsh and dense. All the colours and combinations are accepted.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Behavior ==\nThe Brazilian Dogo is an active and balanced, yet alert, fearless, and watchful dog with a strong guarding instinct. Towards its family, it is obedient, gentle, and affectionate. However, it is serious towards strangers and will be ready to attack if provoked. It should not demonstrate aggressive behaviour without a clear reason - such as purposeful provocation - not even with other dogs. Instead of the more common working trial, a specific character trial is demanded for the breed to reach championship in Brazilian dog shows.\n\n\n== Utilization ==\nThe Brazilian Dogo is mainly used as a guard dog. known as The Urban Guardian, the Brazilian Dogo is strong and compact, adapted to the modern urban environment. The breed was created to be a great working guard dog. \n\n\n== External links ==\nStandard (portuguese)\nBull Boxer Club Dogue brasileiro Blog (portuguese)\nBull Boxer Club Official page\n\n\n== See also ==\nDogo (dog type)\nFila Brasileiro (Brazilian mastiff)\nBrazilian Terrier\nCampeiro Bulldog\nGaucho sheepdog\nBullbras\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 102, "name": "Brazilian Terrier", "country": "Brazil", "type": "", "picture": "dog102", "description": "The Brazilian Terrier is a breed of dog developed in Brazil. It is one of several terriers and one of the two worldwide recognized native breeds of Brazil.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nThe earliest speculation about the origin of the breed theorizes that Jack Russell Terriers, Parson Russell Terriers and Fox Terriers were brought to Brazil from Europe in the 1800s and served as the nearest ancestor of the Brazilian Terrier. And perhaps other breeds such as Miniature Pinschers and large Chihuahuas were also crossed with Jack Russell Terriers to develop this dog.However the most plausible theory is that the breed is derived from spanish breeds such as the Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz and Ratonero valenciano brought to Brazil in vessels during the period of the Iberian Union.It is said that this kind of breed is rarely found outside Brazil.\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThis terrier stands between 13-16 in (35.5-40.5 cm) at the withers. Its coat is always tri-color (white, tan and black or white, tan and blue or white, tan and brown). A docked tail, narrow chest, flat triangular skull and a well balanced body are the most common characteristics. The ears are half-pricked and folded, with the tip falling down.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe temperament of this breed is very similar to a Jack Russell Terrier, very alert, perky and intelligent. Very friendly, loves to play and dig holes. Spirited and obedient but fearless, as watchdogs they will only bark to get your attention and then leave the rest up to you.\nThis breed needs fair and consistent training, otherwise, they can become destructive. Their hunting instinct is the strongest among average terriers and should not be trusted with other small animals.\n\n\n=== Living conditions, exercise, and grooming ===\nSmall apartments or spaces are not good for this type of dog, because they are very active, an average-size yard is highly recommended.\nIt also needs both physical and mental activities to be happy, a common tendency is for it to become destructive and restless if kept indoors, therefore long daily walks are the best option.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of dog breeds\nJapanese Terrier\nFila Brasileiro\nCampeiro Bulldog\nRatonero Bodeguero Andaluz\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFCI - Brazilian Terrier breed standard"}, {"id": 103, "name": "Briard", "country": "France", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog103", "description": "The Briard  is an ancient breed of large herding dog, originally from France. A Briard-like dog appears in Gaston Febus' Livre de chasse (\"Book of the Hunt\"), written in the late 14th century. According to legend, about the same time, a Briard fought a judicial duel with Robert Macaire to avenge the murder of its owner, Aubry of Montdidier. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson, and Lafayette are all said to have owned Briards. The breed became popular after the Paris dog show of 1863, after having been fixed with crosses with the Beauceron and the Barbet. During the First World War, the Briard was used, almost to the point of extinction, by the French army as a sentry, messenger, and to search for wounded soldiers. The Briard's modern-day roles  include police, military and search-and-rescue work, as well as companion dog.\n\n\n== History ==\nThey were originally bred to herd as well as guard flocks of sheep. And they were often left to their own devices in order to accomplish their assigned tasks. This makes the Briard different from those breeds that only guard and those that only herd. The breeds that just herd are often smaller in size, agile, and swift of foot. Those breeds that just guard are usually larger and heavier. Briards were used in all types of herding situations, having the ability to learn many commands and fulfill the jobs expected of them. The Briard was most commonly used as a farm dog in the more crowded farming valleys of France, where row crops were grown. Sheep were allowed to graze the grass strips between crops and Briards were responsible for keeping the sheep moving along these strips, and preventing the sheep from eating the crops. The Briard moved the sheep daily from the farm to the graze areas and back again at night. At the farm, the Briard was the shepherd's partner, helping with livestock chores. The Briard was also used to move large flocks of sheep in areas of France that had wide grazing pastures and mountain pastures in summer. The Briards were usually worked beside one or two other breeds to keep the sheep from straying and herd the sheep to the proper areas. At night, they were alert and vigilant watchdogs, protecting the shepherds and flock from wolves and thieves.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Briard can be tawny, black, grey or blue however there are variations in each color. Briards stand 58 to 69 cm (22 to 27 inches) at the withers.  Ear cropping has been common in the breed, although more breeders are leaving the ears in their natural state since ear cropping is becoming illegal in most European countries, including the Briard's land of origin, France. When cropped, the ears should stand erect and parallel with the base being wide and tapering to a rounded point with hair covering the opening. Their long coat requires an extensive amount of grooming. The outer coat is coarse, hard and dry (making a dry rasping sound between the fingers). It lies down flat, falling naturally in long, slightly waving locks, having the sheen of good health. On the shoulders the length of the hair is generally six inches or more. The undercoat is fine and tight on all the body. The head is well covered with hair which lies down, forming a natural part in the center. The eyebrows do not lie flat but, instead, arch up and out in a curve that lightly veils the eyes. The hair is never so abundant that it masks the form of the head or completely covers the eyes. Briards come in a variety from different colors.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe breed characteristics of the Briard, are of a medium-sized, rugged, agile dog, having harsh coat and double dewclaws mounted low on each rear leg, resembling additional toes. Each double dew claw should have bone substance and nail, giving the appearance of a wider rear foot. Bred for centuries to herd, the additional digits on each rear foot give the Briard the ability of pivoting on one foot for quick turns and complete turn-arounds, which are necessary when herding and guarding their flocks.\nThroughout history, the Briard has retained an appropriate balance of size and build that is required for both herding and protection of their flocks. They are not too large to tire during herding yet large enough to fend off predators such as foxes and wolves.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe Briard is a very loyal and protective breed, and is sometimes called \"a heart of gold wrapped in fur\". Once they have bonded to their family members, they will be very protective. They can be aloof with strangers - new introductions should be on the dog's terms, including furniture or the addition of a new baby into the household. They require showing that the new intrusion is friendly and free of conflict. They must be taught that it is a good thing and not harmful. They have proven to be a very good breed to have around children of all ages. Indeed, these dogs rapidly develop an affection to their owners. They are very emotional, capable of crying for a long time after their owners' departure and celebrate their return in a very enthusiastic way.\nIt is also important that the Briard be introduced to several different individuals of all ages and in all types of situations. Socialization starting at a very young age is mandatory. Briards should be walked as often as possible, to many different places, and they will develop into a well rounded animal. Pet stores, city parks and malls are a good place to start.\n\nThe Briard has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect their flocks. To domesticated briards, their family is the flock and all strangers may appear to be predators. Letting them know that the public in general are friendly and not harmful will help them establish a lifelong socialization pattern which will result in an outgoing and happy dog. This socialization with the public in general will not diminish their capacity for protecting and guarding their family.\n\nThe Briard has a very good memory. Once a lesson is learned, good or bad, the knowledge will be retained for a long time to come. Sometimes they may appear to be strong minded and stubborn but these are a few of the Briard's characteristics. They were bred for centuries to think for themselves and to act upon their conclusions, sometimes to the point of thinking what the \"flock\" will do ahead of time.\nThese are some of the traits that the Briard has retained throughout history. Even if a Briard is a city dweller, they have a degree of herding ability within them. If ever, during their lifetime, they are introduced to sheep or cattle, they will automatically start doing what they were bred to do, herding. They will even herd humans by nibbling on their ankles or guiding with their heads and guide them to his master if ordered.\n\n\n=== Service and therapy roles ===\nBriards have been used in a variety of service and therapy roles to help those with disabilities and comfort those in hospitals, schools and retirement communities.  Briards are also being trained as autism service dogs and PTSD service dogs for both adults and children.  With their keen intelligence, tactile coat interaction, and loyalty, they can make a difference in the quality of life for those with disabilities or in recovery. \nWith their breed tendency toward a dominant working temperament, aggression, and high prey drive due to their history as a working guardian type dog, they also can be very problematic, even dangerous, used for service or therapy work in the public setting. Some bloodlines have more issues with temperament than others. One needs to exercise caution. If inappropriately trained they have a higher potential to attack other dogs (including other service dogs) or strangers around them  so careful selection, thorough training, and appropriate pairing of the individual dog with a handler appropriate to that particular dog is extremely important for success as a service dog with this breed. \nThe potential for aggression, especially towards other dogs and strangers is something that one who is training them for service work or similar pursuits needs to be aware of (and truthfully educate potential handlers about if placing in another home). While a small portion of Briards certainly have the proper temperament needed to participate in service work and similar, a larger portion are only suited for, and will do fine with an experienced handler and another portion not even then. Being a dog tending to a dominant temperament, and a powerful working breed, with often a high prey drive, any pairing with the inexperienced, small children, the physically fragile and the like should be undertaken with caution for the safety of the handler and the public around them . \nThis is not a breed, among others, that most trainers or service dog training establishments would choose or recommend for public service work with handlers that lack experience with these types of dogs. Potential handlers need to do their homework on a breed before committing to it.\n\"Breeds classified as Guard Dogs, Flock Guardians or Fighting Dogs have aggression related breed traits that are particularly worrisome.  Assistance dog partners who do not have previous experience handling a dog with a strong Protection drive, a fierce Territorial instinct or a hereditary dog aggression problem should not attempt a partnership with one of these breeds.  Those who do choose to work with one of these breeds must respect the darker side of its nature, learn how to avoid triggering it and never ignore the potential for a misunderstanding.This accurately describes the Briard and many other working breeds perfectly.\n\"The Briard is probably not the breed for you if you lack leadership skills, believe in giving in to every wish and desire of your pets or don't have the time, energy or commitment to bring out the best in a new Briard puppy.\"\n\n\n=== Activities ===\nBriards can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, Schutzhund, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Briards exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n=== Study on blindness using Briards ===\nThis breed is also commonly screened for congenital stationary night blindness (SNB) with a DNA test. SNB is inherited through recessive genes.\nProgressive retinal atrophy PRA, is a disease that causes nerve cells at the back of the eye to degenerate. The condition usually begins in older pets and can lead to blindness. Progressive retinal degeneration or atrophy (PRD/PRA) represents a group of inherited eye diseases characterized by abnormal development or premature degeneration of the retina. There are two types of photoreceptors in the retina and these are the light-sensitive rods and cones. They are responsible for detecting light and converting it into an electrical signal that travels to the brain. When the photoreceptor cells deteriorate, vision is lost because the animal has no way to generate an image from the light reaching the retina. Puppies are usually blind before one year of age.\nFor the first time ever, animals (Briards) that were born blind gained the ability to see after undergoing gene therapy, according to research from the University of Florida, Cornell University and the University of Pennsylvania.\nUF researchers had established that the apparently harmless adeno-associated virus can carry healthy copies of a gene into the cells of the retina, which is composed of layers of light-sensitive nerve cells. The healthy gene's mission: to produce a protein critical to translating light waves into nerve impulses that can be interpreted as images by the brain. The study was successful and the puppies could see in the eye that was treated. Officials from the Foundation Fighting Blindness, which supported the study with grant funds, said the success in reversing blindness in dogs is an important advance.\n\n\n== Briards in popular culture ==\n\nKiss Kiss Bang Bang - \"Stevie\"\nMy Three Sons - \"Tramp\"\nBachelor Father - \"Jasper\" (played by Briard mix \"Red\" 2nd Jasper 1960\u201362)\nGet Smart - Agent K-13 \"Fang\" (played by Briard mix \"Red\" 1965\u201366)\nMarried... with Children - \"Buck\" (played by Briard \"Michael\")\nDharma & Greg - \"Stinky\" (played by Briard mix \"Chewy\")\nAddams Family - \"Them\" (played by Briard mix \"Mayhem\")\nTop Dog - (film starring Chuck Norris - 1995) - \"Reno\"\nDennis the Menace (1993) - \"Rosie\"\nBuddy (Starring Rene Russo - motion picture about a gorilla named Buddy) (1997)\nThe Karate Dog (made-for-TV movie) - (voiced by Chevy Chase) (2004)\nTell No One (Ne le dis \u00e0 personne) \u2013 (played by \"O P'tit Loup\") (2006)\nEasy A\nSam Sheepdog of Looney Tunes fame\nDinky Dog\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links =="}, {"id": 104, "name": "Briquet Griffon Vend\u00e9en", "country": "France", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog104", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 105, "name": "Brittany dog", "country": "France", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog105", "description": "The Brittany is a breed of gun dog bred primarily for bird hunting.  Although it is often referred to as a spaniel, the breed's working characteristics are more akin to those of a pointer or setter. Brittanys were developed in the Brittany province of France between the 17th and 19th centuries, becoming officially recognized early in the 20th.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe name \"Brittany\" is taken from the Brittany region in northwestern France where the dog originated. Images of orange and white Brittany-like dogs hunting and retrieving game were first seen on tapestries and paintings from the 17th century. The first written and verifiable record of Brittanys comes from a hunting description written by Reverend Davies in 1850. He described hunting with small \"bobtailed\" dogs who pointed and were excellent retrievers. It was around the same time that the modern Brittany is rumored to have been bred by mating with English Setters. The Brittany was first shown at the Paris Dog Show in 1900.The Brittany was first recognized as a breed in 1907 when an orange and white male named Boy was registered in France. As a result, the first standards were outlined in the same year. America recognized the Brittany in 1931 and the breed was approved by the American Kennel Club in 1934. In 1982 the \"Spaniel\" was officially dropped from the name.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Brittany is typically quite athletic, compact, energetic, and solidly built without being heavy.  Their heads are of average size with floppy ears, expressions usually of intelligence, vigour, and alertness, and gait elastic, long, and free.\nMost Brittanys are born with naturally short tails, yet others are rarely born with long tails, which are docked to a length of 3\u201310 centimetres (1.2\u20133.9 in)\nThe breed's coat color is varied: orange and white coat or liver and white are most common in the American Brittany; other colors include orange roan and liver roan, all of which are acceptable in the show ring. The American Brittany Standard specifies an acceptable tri-color of liver, orange, and white with very specific color placement.\n\n\n=== Size ===\nBrittanys are medium-sized dogs, with American lines (17.5\u201320.5 inches (44\u201352 cm) at the withers according to an AKC standard adopted in 1990) tending to be larger and have a blockier head than French (17\u201320.5 inches (43\u201352 cm)), and females at the lower end. A properly constructed and healthy Brittany maintains a weight between 30\u201345 pounds (14\u201320 kg), depending upon height.\n\n\n==== Types ====\nMany breeders differentiate between \"American\" Brittanys and \"French\" style dogs.  Although generally recognized as sub-sets of the same breed, there are recognizable differences between the two. The \"American Brittany\" is typically larger than the \"French Brittany\"  and a bigger running dog while the smaller French Brittany generally works more closely to the guns, but will work according to the local terrain. However, some breeders consider these \"differences\" to be unsound generalizations and that American standards should be updated to reflect the breed's standard in its country of origin, i.e. France, where black has become an acceptable coat color since 1956 while it is still considered a fault in America.\nThough it resembles a Spaniel-like dog used for flushing game, such as Springers and Cockers, Brittanys are more akin to pointers and all-purpose sporting dogs. Known in the United Kingdom as an HPR breed (Hunt, point, and retrieve), they are expected to point and retrieve all birds and ground game up to and including hare. These unique qualities have given the Brittany more Dual Champions than any other AKC Sporting Breed, a landmark reached with the 500th in 2006.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Brittany was originally bred as a hunting dog and noted for being easy to train and sweet-natured. The breed is generally more sensitive to correction than other hunters, and harsh corrections are often unnecessary.  Brittanys can become very shy if not thoroughly socialized at a young age, and even among well-socialized dogs there is significant variation in levels of friendliness.\nWhen well socialized, Brittanys are all around sound dogs, excelling  as companions, family pets, and field dogs. Eager to please and friendly, they generally learn quickly and are loyal and attached to their owners.  They are energetic and need at least an hour of vigorous exercise every day, with many needing more than this. Some animals will be over-active or hyper-sensitive, but these problems are almost invariably due to lack of exercise and training, and are not characteristics of well cared-for dogs.With more American dual champions (dogs with titles in both conformation shows and field trials) than any other breed, the Brittany maintains strong hunting instincts in all bloodlines.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nBrittanys are generally healthy and hardy dogs. The median lifespan for Brittanys in France is 12.6 years. A UK Kennel Club survey puts the breed's median lifespan at 12 years 11 months, with about 1 in 5 dogs dying of old age at an average of 14\u201315 years.  Brittanys have no undercoat and need minimal grooming or bathing. However, their floppy ears tend to trap moisture in the ear canal and should be cleaned regularly.\nDiseases found in the breed include hip dysplasia, with 14.9% of Brittanys tested between 1974 and 2009 by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals displaying the condition, and a lesser rate of 10.3% for dogs born 2003-2004.

It has been employed as a guard dog in the homes of the wealthy. The breed's numbers dwindled severely during World War II, but the dog made a successful return in the 1970s.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Denmark Broholmer is a dog that strongly resembles a Mastiff. It is large and powerful, with a loud, impressive bark and dominant walk.\nA well trained Broholmer should be calm, good tempered, and friendly, yet watchful towards strangers. Females stand about 27.5 inches (70 cm) and weigh in at 90\u2013130 pounds (41\u201359 kg).  Males stand about 29.5 inches (75 cm) and weigh in at 110\u2013150 pounds (50\u201368 kg). The body is built square and rectangular with a large and massive head. The width and length of the skull and the length of the nose should be of equal length. The head is generally not carried very high. The coat is short and harsh, and the color can be light or brownish yellow, or black. Some white markings on the coat are permitted, and a black mask may be found.  The average life span is around 7\u201312 years.\n\n\n== Historical note ==\nThe Broholmer breed was generated from a cross between English Mastiffs and local dogs in Germany, and was named after Sehested of Broholm, a game-keeper who lived in the 18th century. During the Second World War, the Broholmer became a victim of the strife and almost became extinct, but was saved by a group of Danish enthusiasts after isolated members were found in the 1970s. King Frederick VII and his consort, Countess Danner were owners of several Broholmers and one of their portraits depicts them with one of their dogs.  The breed was established in the early 19th century and was moderately popular, especially as a guard dog in the homes of wealthy Danes.The Breed was imported to the UK in 2009 with a view to being put on the UK kennel clubs import list.  \nIt was discovered in the recent years (2016) that the Broholmers that were imported into the USA were all afflicted with Degenerative Myelopathy (DM), a spontaneously occurring, adult-onset spinal cord disorder that affects dogs, and is similar to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease in humans (1). With DM, there is degeneration of the \u201cwhite matter\u201d of the spinal cord and the peripheral nerves. The white matter tracts of the spinal cord contain fibers that transmit movement commands from the brain to the limbs and sensory information from the limbs to the brain. The breed is, to this day, going to die out in the USA due to the unethical breeding practices and lack of health testing of the Europeans. The first Broholmer to ever be imported into the United States passed away in 2018 due to DM, and all other dogs imported have DM as well.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBroholmer at Curlie\nBROHOLMER-315 at F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale"}, {"id": 107, "name": "Bruno Jura Hound", "country": "Switzerland, France", "type": "", "picture": "dog107", "description": "The Bruno Jura hound is a domestic dog, developed in the Middle Ages for hunting in the Jura Mountains on the Swiss-French border.They are found in a variety of colors and have a broad head and heavy wrinkles, which differentiate them from the other Swiss hounds.

It was developed over many centuries by shepherds in the Carpathian Mountains. The race was developed in Bucovina, a region in the north of Romania.\nThere are three types of Romanian shepherd dogs: the Mioritic (old name Barac), the Carpatin (old name Z\u0103vod) and the Bucovina Shepherd. In the FCI, this particular breed is known as the Southeastern European Shepherd.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt is a natural breed with its origin in the Carpathian Mountains (Romania and Serbia) and the South of Danube (some regions of Bulgaria). Special attention for the development of the breed arose in the regions of northeastern Romania, in the county of Bucovina, as well as in northeastern Serbia - the well-known transhumance areas of the shepherds since immemorial times. Selection and improvement have\nled to the actual type. The breed is successfully used both for defending the flocks and herds and as watchdogs for households in the mentioned regions.The first standard was written in 1982 and updated in 2001 by the Asociatia Chinologica Romana (Romanian Kennel Club). The present standard, dating from March 29, 2002, was written and updated according to the model established in 1987 by the FCI General Assembly in Jerusalem.The Bucovina Shepherd is only provisionally accepted by the FCI, while its cousins have already been officially recognized.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Bucovina Shepherd dog was bred to protect sheep flocks and cattle herds, and proves courageous and very combative when potential predators are afoot. It is an excellent watchdog, having a very deep, powerful bark and being very alert when strangers enter its territory. During the night, it patrols around the property or herds. An adult Bucovina Sheepdog needs plenty of space to run around with a large back yard.\nThis breed is balanced, calm, very devoted, and loves children. It strongly mistrusts strangers.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nLarge sized dog; commanding, haughty and proud. The breed has an obvious sexual dimorphism.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nHead and the front part of the legs are covered with short hair. On the body, hair is abundant, long (6-9 cm), flat, straight and\nrough. Undercoat is shorter, very dense and supple, and of a lighter colour. At the neck region, hair is much longer forming a mane; on the backside of the forequarters, the hair forms fringes; on the backside of hindquarters, the hair is longer and forms culottes. The tail is bushy.\n\n\n=== Color ===\nMain colour of coat is a clear white or white-beige with distinct patches of grey, black or black with red-fawn reflections. Black or grey ticks can appear on the legs. Brindle aspect of patches to be rejected.\n\n\n=== Size ===\nThe male Bucovina Shepherd is 68\u201378 centimetres (27\u201331 in) tall. The females are close in size, at 64\u201372 centimetres (25\u201328 in).\n\n\n=== Conformation ===\nThe Bucovina Shepherd's head is massive, slightly elevated with respect to the back line. The skull is moderately wide. The stop is slightly marked. The nose is black well developed and wide. The muzzle has the shape of a truncated cone, of the same length as the skull, well developed. It becomes progressively narrow towards the extremity but it is never pointed.\nThe lips are thick, well applied, with strong pigmentation. This breed should have strong jaws, with healthy white teeth and a scissors bite. Level bite is allowed.\nThe cheeks are not prominent. The eyes are small in comparison with the dimensions of the skull, almond-shaped and slanting, chestnut colored or slightly lighter, never yellow.\n\n Its eyelids are well pigmented. The ears are high, \u201cV\u201d shaped, with rounded tips, fallen, and very close to the cheeks. The neck is moderately long, bulky and strong, without dewlap.\nThe muscular body is massive with a well supported back. The chest is wide and tall, reaching the level of the elbows with well arched ribs. The skin is thick and dark gray. The hair is short on the head and forelegs. On the body, the hair is abundant, straight, thicker and harder, 2\u00bd- 3\u00bd inches (6\u20139 cm.) long. The next layer of hair is shorter and thick, with a lighter color. On the neck, the hair is longer and forms a mane. On the backside of the legs, the hair forms fringes of moderate length.\nThe tail is bushy, covered with longer and thicker hair. When the dog is relaxed it tends to hold the tail low, reaching the point of the hock or even lower. When the dog is alert and is paying attention or is in action, the tail is elevated. In this case it may rise above the level of the back, sickle shaped.\n\n\n=== Gait ===\nHarmonious, elastic, well coordinated, giving the impression of effortless power. Preferred gait is the trot.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Carpathian Shepherd\n Mioritic Shepherd\n Romanian Raven Shepherd\nMountain dog\nGuard dog\nLivestock guardian dog\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Bucovina Shepherd Dog's page at ciobanesc.ro\nBucovina Shepherd Dogs' Breeders"}, {"id": 109, "name": "Bull and Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog109", "description": "The Bull and Terrier is an extinct type of dog that was the progenitor of the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, Bull Terrier, Miniature Bull Terrier and Staffordshire Bull Terrier.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Bull and Terrier is a cross between the Old English Bulldog and a variety of Old English Terriers.There were several varieties of this combination between bulldog and terrier, depending on the location (town or country) and the dogs chosen for the crossing. In Ireland, they used the old Irish bulldog with different terriers and some insertion of hunting sighthound/terrier crosses. In England, there were several varieties, among which three became known and survived until the 1930s. These were the Walsall type, that had some influence from Whippet; the Darlaston type, that had the major influence of terrier blood; and the Cradley Heath type, that had more Bulldog blood. Phil Drabble reported that among these three types of bull and terrier, the type of Cradley Heath was recognized as a separate breed under name of Staffordshire Bull Terrier in 1935, and the other types gradually disappeared because they did not meet the imposed standard. But decades earlier, in the 19th century, at least the Walsall type was carried by immigrants to the United States, where it served as an important component for the genetic basis of the American Pit Bull Terrier breed, through specimens such as the dog Lloyd's Pilot and the Colby bloodline, strongly combined with Irish strains.The anatomy of the Bull and Terrier is the result of selective breeding for the purpose of hunting, dog fighting and baiting.\n\n\n=== Hunting ===\nMost terriers, of the past and present, carried or carry a quarter to an eighth Old English Bulldog blood in them in order, allegedly, to give courage to bear the bites of the prey they are meant to attack. Terriers who were not developed from crosses between the Old English Bulldog and earth-working dogs were of inferior quality and were valued far less.\n\nThere are earth-working dogs who by default and definition are called terriers because they have the ability to go to ground; however, the best earth-working and hunting terriers are the progeny of bulldogs bred to earth-working dogs (terriers), also known as the 'Bull-Terrier' or 'half-bred' dog.John Henry Walsh wrote in 'The dog, in health and disease, by Stonehenge' (1859):\n\nThe terrier as used for hunting is a strong useful little dog, with great endurance and courage, and with nearly as good a nose as the Beagle or Harrier. From his superior courage when crossed with the Bulldog, as most vermin-terriers are, he has generally been kept for killing vermin whose bite would deter the Spaniel or the Beagle, but would only render the terrier more determined in his pursuit of them.\n\nWalsh also wrote of the Fox Terrier:\n\nThe field fox-terrier, used for bolting the fox when gone to ground, was of this breed (bull and terrier).\n\nNot only is the Fox Terrier the progeny of the Bull and Terrier, but so is the Airedale Terrier, rat-working terriers, working black and tan terriers, and most all other vermin-hunting terriers.James Rodwell described in his book titled The rat: its history and destructive nature, that the great object, among the various breeders of Bull and Terrier dogs for hunting vermin and rats, was to have them as nearly thorough-bred bull as possible, but at the same time preserving all the outward appearances of the terrier as to size, shape, and colour.\n\n\n=== Dog fighting ===\n\nThe Old English Bulldog was bred for bull-baiting.  Its life depended on \"Go Low, Pin and Hold\".  Such a breed was unsuitable for dog fighting in the pit.  Once an Old English Bulldog got a good grip, there would be little left for the spectators to see, except for two dogs gripping each other, closing their jaws tighter and tighter.\nRequired were quick attacks, new grips, and tricks, which made up the drama of a dog fight that appealed to spectators, gamblers, and dog owners.  The introduction of English Terrier blood provided longer legs, fiery temperament, and speed, which provided entertaining fights.\nThe crossing of bulldog and terrier produced a dog that no longer belonged to either foundation breed.  The new breed was called the Bull and Terrier.   With attributes such as ferociousness, aggressiveness, and intelligence, there were few fighting tasks it could not perform better than other breeds of those times.\nIn 1835, with the banning of baiting the breed was placed in jeopardy of extinction; however, while bull-baiting and bear-baiting laws were enforced, dog fighting flourished, so the Bull and Terrier lived on.  Around 1860, the Bull and Terrier breed split into two branches, the pure white Bull Terrier and the coloured forms that lived on for another seventy years in the dog pit until they finally were recognized as a legitimate dog breed called the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Around the same time, many lower class Irish and Englishmen were emigrating to America with their proto-Staffordshire Bull Terriers.  Over time, the descendants of these dogs became taller and heavier. Their masters opted for a dog that was both an aggressive warrior in the gambling dens of the cities and saloons but also was a working dog, its terrier and bulldog blood from Ireland and the UK proving to be very useful in farm work and in hunting. The breed was officially recognized as the  American Pit Bull Terrier, in 1898 and later its close kin the American Staffordshire Terrier in 1936.\n\n\n== Famous Bull and Terriers ==\n\n\n=== Billy ===\nA celebrated Bull and Terrier named \"Billy\", weighing approximately 26 pounds, set a world record for rat-baiting on April 22, 1823 by killing 100 rats in five-and-a-half minutes.\n\n\n=== Dustman ===\nIn 1812, Sporting Magazine described \"Dustman\" as a very famous and talented fighting dog, which represented the optimal Bull and Terrier type.\n\n\n=== Trusty ===\nAccording to accounts in the Sporting Magazine from the year 1804, a Bull and Terrier named \"Trusty\" was just as famous throughout England as the Emperor Napoleon.  Trusty went undefeated in one hundred and four dog fights.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBulldog Information"}, {"id": 110, "name": "Bull Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog110", "description": "The Bull Terrier is a breed of dog in the terrier family. There is also a miniature version of this breed which is officially known as the Miniature Bull Terrier.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Bull Terrier's most recognizable feature is its head, described as 'shark-head-shaped' (sometimes confused with egg-shaped) when viewed from the front; the top of the skull is almost flat. The profile curves gently downwards from the top of the skull to the tip of the nose, which is black and bent downwards at the tip, with well developed nostrils. The under-jaw is deep and strong. The unique triangular eyes are small, dark, and deep-set. Bull Terriers are the only dogs that have triangular eyes. The body is full and round, with strong, muscular shoulders. The tail is carried horizontally. They are either white, red, fawn, black, brindle, or a combination of these.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nBull Terriers can be both independent and stubborn and for this reason are not considered suitable for an inexperienced dog owner. A Bull Terrier has an even temperament and is amenable to discipline. Although obstinate, they are particularly good with people. Early socialisation will ensure that the dog will get along with other dogs and animals. Their personality is described as courageous, full of spirit, with a fun-loving attitude, a children-loving dog and a perfect family member. Although the breed has been a target of breed-specific legislation, a 2008 study in Germany didn't find that Bull Terriers have any significant temperament difference from Golden retrievers in overall temperament researches.\n\n\n== Health ==\nAll puppies should be checked for deafness, which occurs in 20.4% of pure white Bull Terriers and 1.3% of colored Bull Terriers and is difficult to notice, especially in a relatively young puppy. Many Bull Terriers have a tendency to develop skin allergies. Insect bites, such as those from fleas, and sometimes mosquitoes and mites, can produce a generalised allergic response of hives, rash, and itching. This problem can be stopped by keeping the dog free of contact from these insects, but this is definitely a consideration in climates or circumstances where exposure to these insects is inevitable. A UK breed survey puts their median lifespan at 10 years and their mean at 9 years (1 s.f., RSE = 13.87% 2 d. p.), with a good number of dogs living to 10\u201315 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAt the start of the 19th century the \"Bull and Terrier\" breeds were developed to satisfy the needs for vermin control and animal-based blood sports.  The Bull and Terriers were based on the Old English Bulldog (now extinct) and Old English Terriers with possible other terriers. This new breed combined the speed and dexterity of lightly built terriers with the dour tenacity of the Bulldog, which was a poor performer in most combat situations, having been bred almost exclusively for fighting bulls and bears tied to a post. Many breeders began to breed bulldogs with terriers, arguing that such a mixture enhances the quality of fighting. Despite the fact that a cross between a bulldog and a terrier was of high value, very little or nothing was done to preserve the breed in its original form. Due to the lack of breed standards\u2014breeding was for performance, not appearance\u2014the \"Bull and Terrier\" eventually divided into the ancestors of \"Bull Terriers\" and \"Staffordshire Bull Terriers\", both smaller and easier to handle than the progenitor.In the mid-19th century James Hinks started breeding Bull and Terriers with \"English White Terriers\" (now extinct), looking for a cleaner appearance with better legs and nicer head.  In 1862, Hinks entered a dam called \"Puss\" sired by his white Bulldog called \"Madman\" into the Bull Terrier Class at the dog show held at the Cremorne Gardens in Chelsea.  Originally known as the \"Hinks Breed\" and \"The White Cavalier\", these dogs did not yet have the now-familiar \"egg face\", but kept the stop in the skull profile.\nThe dog was immediately popular and breeding continued, using Dalmatian, Spanish Pointer, and Whippet to increase elegance and agility; and Borzoi and Rough Collie to reduce the stop.  Hinks wanted his dogs white, and bred specifically for this. The first modern Bull Terrier is now recognised as \"Lord Gladiator\", from 1917, being the first dog with no stop at all.Due to medical problems associated with all-white breeding, Ted Lyon among others began introducing colour, using Staffordshire Bull Terriers in the early 20th century.  Coloured Bull Terriers were recognised as a separate variety (at least by the AKC) in 1936.  Brindle is the preferred colour, but other colours are welcome.Along with conformation, specific behaviour traits were sought. The epithet \"White Cavalier\", harking back to an age of chivalry, was bestowed on a breed which while never seeking to start a fight was well able to finish one, while socialising well with its \"pack\", including children and pups. Hinks himself had always aimed at a \"gentleman's companion\" dog rather than a pit-fighter\u2014though Bullies were often entered in the pits, with some success.\n\nBull Terrier\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nGeneral George S.

It is a muscular, hefty dog with a wrinkled face and a distinctive pushed-in nose. The American Kennel Club (AKC), The Kennel Club (UK), and the United Kennel Club (UKC) oversee breeding records. Bulldogs were the fourth most popular purebred in the US in 2016 according to the American Kennel Club.Bulldogs have a longstanding association with English culture, as the BBC wrote: \"to many the Bulldog is a national icon, symbolising pluck and determination.\" During World War II, Bulldogs were often likened to Prime Minister Winston Churchill and his defiance of Nazi Germany.  When the English settled in the Americas, their Bulldogs came with them. A few dedicated bulldog fanciers formed the Bulldog Club of America in 1890 and it was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York on November 29, 1904.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nBulldogs have characteristically wide heads and shoulders along with a pronounced mandibular prognathism. There are generally thick folds of skin on the brow; round, black, wide-set eyes; a short muzzle with characteristic folds called a rope or nose roll above the nose; hanging skin under the neck; drooping lips and pointed teeth, and an underbite with an upturned jaw. The coat is short, flat, and sleek with colours of red, fawn, white, brindle, and piebald.In the United Kingdom, the breed standards are 55 lb (25 kg) for a male and 50 lb (23 kg) for a female. In the United States, a typical mature male weighs 50 lb (23 kg), while mature females weigh about 40 lb (18 kg). The Bulldog Club of America recommends the average weight of a bulldog to be 40\u201350 lb (18\u201323 kg).Bulldogs are one of the few breeds whose tail is naturally short and either straight or screwed and thus is not cut or docked as with some other breeds. A straight tail is a more desirable tail according to the breed standard set forth by the BCA if it is facing downward, not upwards.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nAccording to the American Kennel Club (AKC), a Bulldog's disposition should be \"equable and kind, resolute, and courageous (not vicious or aggressive), and demeanor should be pacific and dignified. These attributes should be countenanced by the expression and behavior\".\n Breeders have worked to reduce/remove aggression from these dogs.  Most have a friendly, patient, but stubborn nature. Bulldogs are recognized as excellent family pets because of their tendency to form strong bonds with children.Generally, Bulldogs are known for getting along well with children, other dogs, and other pets.Bulldogs have been rated one of the least intelligent breeds; they were ranked 78th out of 80 by obedience experts in Working/Obedience Intelligence.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe term \"Bulldog\" was first mentioned in literature around 1500, the oldest spelling of the word being Bondogge and Bolddogge. The first reference to the word with the modern spelling is dated 1631 or 1632 in a letter by a man named Preswick Eaton where he writes: \"procuer mee two good Bulldogs, and let them be sent by ye first shipp\". \nIn 1666, English scientist Christopher Merret applied: \"Canis pugnax, a Butchers Bull or Bear Dog\", as an entry in his Pinax Rerum Naturalium Britannicarum.The designation \"bull\" was applied because of the dog's use in the sport of bull baiting. This entailed the setting of dogs (after placing wagers on each dog) onto a tethered bull. The dog that grabbed the bull by the nose and pinned it to the ground would be the victor. It was common for a bull to maim or kill several dogs at such an event, either by goring, tossing, or trampling. Over the centuries, dogs used for bull-baiting developed the stocky bodies and massive heads and jaws that typify the breed as well as a ferocious and savage temperament. Bull-baiting, along with bear-baiting, reached the peak of its popularity in England in the early 1800s until they were both made illegal by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835. This amended the existing legislation to protect animals from mistreatment and included (as \"cattle\") snakes, dogs, owls, and donkeys, so that bull and bear-baiting as well as cockfighting became prohibited. Therefore, the Old English Bulldog had outlived its usefulness in England as a sporting animal and its active or \"working\" days were numbered. However, emigrants did have a use for such dogs in the New World. In mid-17th century New York, Bulldogs were used as a part of a citywide roundup effort led by Governor Richard Nicolls. Because cornering and leading wild bulls were dangerous, Bulldogs were trained to seize a bull by its nose long enough for a rope to be secured around its neck. Bulldogs as pets were continually promoted by dog dealer Bill George.\n\nDespite slow maturation so that growing up is rarely achieved by two and a half years, Bulldogs' lives are relatively short. At five to six years of age they start to show signs of aging.\nHistorically, it was thought the original old English Bulldog was something else mixed with the Weimaraner. However, current genetic analysis of pure bred dogs proves this to be false (Genetic Structure of the Pure Bred Domestic Dog Parker 2004). In fact, the Weimaraner is not related to the bulldog. Though today's Bulldog looks tough, he cannot perform the job he was originally created for as he cannot withstand the rigors of running and being thrown by a bull, and also cannot grip with such a short muzzle.  Although not as physically capable as their ancestors, decreased levels of aggression associated with modern bulldogs have resulted in far calmer temperament while remaining physically capable guards and companions.\nThe oldest single breed specialty club is The Bulldog Club (England), which was formed in 1878. Members of this club met frequently at the Blue Post pub on Oxford Street in London. There they wrote the first standard of perfection for the breed. In 1894 the two top Bulldogs, King Orry and Dockleaf, competed in a contest to see which dog could walk 20 miles (32 km). King Orry was reminiscent of the original Bulldogs, lighter boned and very athletic. Dockleaf was smaller and heavier set, more like modern Bulldogs. King Orry was declared the winner that year, finishing the 20-mile (32 km) walk while Dockleaf collapsed. The Bulldog was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1886.At the turn of the 20th century, Ch. Rodney Stone became the first Bulldog to command a price of $5,000 when he was bought by controversial Irish American political figure Richard Croker.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nA 2004 UK survey of 180 Bulldog deaths puts the median age at death at 6 years 3 months. The leading cause of death of Bulldogs in the survey was cardiac related (20%), cancer (18%), and old age (9%). Those that died of old age had an average lifespan of 10 to 11 years. A 2013 UK vet clinic survey of 26 Bulldogs puts the median lifespan at 8.4 years with an interquartile range of 3.2\u201311.3 years. The UK Bulldog Breed Council website lists the average life span of the breed as 8\u201310 years.Statistics from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals indicate that of the 467 Bulldogs tested between 1979 and 2009 (30 years), 73.9% were affected by hip dysplasia, the highest amongst all breeds. Similarly, the breed has the worst score in the British Veterinary Association/Kennel Club Hip Dysplasia scoring scheme, although only 22 Bulldogs were tested in the scheme. Patellar luxation affects 6.2% of Bulldogs.Some individuals of this breed are prone to interdigital cysts\u2014cysts that form between the toes. These cause the dog some discomfort, but are treatable either by vet or an experienced owner. They may also suffer from respiratory problems. Other problems can include cherry eye, a protrusion of the inner eyelid (which can be corrected by a veterinarian), allergies, and hip issues in older Bulldogs.\nOver 80% of Bulldog litters are delivered by Caesarean section because their characteristically large heads can become lodged in the mother's birth canal. The folds, or \"rope\", on a Bulldog's face should be cleaned daily to avoid infections caused by moisture accumulation. Some Bulldogs' naturally curling tails can be so tight to the body as to require regular cleaning and ointment. Due to the high volume of skin folds on the Bulldog's body, they have high prevalence of skin-fold dermatitis.Like all dogs, Bulldogs require daily exercise. If not properly exercised it is possible for a Bulldog to become overweight, which could lead to heart and lung problems, as well as stress on the joints.\n\nBulldogs have very small nasal cavities and thus have great difficulty keeping their bodies cool. Bulldogs are very sensitive to heat. Extra caution should be practiced in warmer climates and during summer months. Bulldogs must be given plenty of shade and water, and must be kept out of standing heat. Air conditioning and good ventilation are required to keep them healthy and safe. Bulldogs actually do most of their sweating through the pads on their feet and accordingly enjoy cool floors. Like all brachycephalic, or \"short faced\", breeds, Bulldogs can easily become overheated and even die from hyperthermia. Bulldog owners can keep these issues under control by staying aware and protecting their Bulldog(s) from these unsafe conditions. They can be heavy breathers, and they tend to be loud snorers. In 2014 the Dutch Kennel Club implemented some breeding rules to improve the health of the Bulldog. Among these is a fitness test where the dog has to walk 1 km (0.62 miles) in 12 minutes. Its temperature and heart rate has to recover after 15 minutes.In January 2009, after the BBC documentary Pedigree Dogs Exposed, The Kennel Club introduced revised breed standards for the British Bulldog, along with 209 other breeds, to address health concerns. Opposed by the British Bulldog Breed Council, it was speculated by the press that the changes would lead to a smaller head, fewer skin folds, a longer muzzle, and a taller thinner posture, in order to combat problems with respiration and breeding due to head size and width of shoulders.\n\n\n== As a mascot ==\n\nThe Bulldog is popularly used to represent England or the United Kingdom. It has been associated with Winston Churchill's defiance of Nazi Germany.English professional wrestler Davey Boy Smith was nicknamed \"The British Bulldog\", and often brought a Bulldog named Matilda to the ring with him.A Bulldog is the official mascot of the United States Marine Corps, and many bases have their own mascot on base.\nMack Trucks use the bulldog as their hood emblem.\nThirty-nine American universities use a Bulldog as their mascot including Georgetown, Butler, CSU Fresno State, Drake, Gonzaga, North Carolina A&T, Mississippi State, Louisiana Tech, Yale, The Citadel South Carolina State, Georgia, and the University of Redlands.The Bulldog is an official mascot of the Croatian ultras group Bad Blue Boys, which supports the football club GNK Dinamo Zagreb.\nThe Australian Rugby League team Canterbury-Bankstown has a Bulldog as its emblem and mascot. \nThe Western Bulldogs Australian rules football club has a real-life bulldog mascot named Caesar.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCompanion dog\nCompanion Dog Group\nMolosser\nNon-Sporting Group\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBulldog at Curlie"}, {"id": 112, "name": "Bullenbeisser", "country": "Germany", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog112", "description": "The Bullenbeisser, also known as the German Bulldog, was a breed of dog known for its strength and agility. The breed was closely related to the B\u00e4renbeisser (some believe that  the two breeds were the same; the names mean \"bull-biter\" and \"bear-biter,\" respectively), and was an ancestor to the modern Boxer breed. It was, in all its aspects, similar to the present Alano Espa\u00f1ol (Spanish Bulldog) and very alike to the Dogo Argentino, not only in aspect, but also in usage. There were two regional varieties, the Brabanter Bullenbeisser and the Danziger Bullenbeisser. The breed is now extinct.\n\n\n== Extinction ==\n\nThe Bullenbeisser (\"bull biter\") became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed, as happened with the Old English Bulldog, for instance. The size of the Bull Biters varied from about 40 to 70 cm by 1850; the smaller lines lived in what today is the Netherlands and Belgium, with larger dogs in Germany. In the late 1870s, German breeders Roberth, Konig, and Hopner used the dog to create a new breed, today called the Boxer by crossing Bullenbeissers with Bulldogs brought from Britain. The original ancestry was 50/50. However, German owners started crossing their dogs with many Bulldog lineages, which produced an indistinguishable breed after World War II.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBoxer (dog)\nBulldog\nDogo Argentino\nGreat Dane\nAlano Espa\u00f1ol\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBanter Bulldog"}, {"id": 113, "name": "Bullmastiff", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog113", "description": "The Bullmastiff is a large-sized breed of domestic dog, with a solid build and a short muzzle. The Bullmastiff shares the characteristics of molosser dogs, and was originally developed by 19th-century gamekeepers to guard estates. The breed's bloodlines are drawn from the English Mastiff and the  extinct Old English Bulldog. It was recognized as a purebred dog by the English Kennel Club in 1924.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\n\n=== Size ===\nBullmastiff males should stand 25\u201327 inches (64\u201369 cm) tall (American Kennel Club (AKC) standard) at the withers and weigh 110\u2013130 pounds (50\u201359 kg). Females should be 24\u201326 inches (61\u201366 cm) at the withers, and 100\u2013120 pounds (45\u201354 kg). Exceeding these dimensions is discouraged by breeders.\n\n\n=== Color ===\nA Bullmastiff's coat may appear in fawn, red, or brindle. These are the only acceptable colours in the AKC standard. The fawn can range from a very light brown to a reddish brown. Red can range from a light red-fawn to a dark, rich red. Brindles are a striped overlay of the fawn or red. A Bullmastiff should have no white markings, except for on the chest where a little white is allowed.\n\n\n== History ==\nBullmastiffs are a large working breed originating in Britain in the mid 1800s as estate guardians to ward off poachers. They were bred by gamekeepers for strength, size and speed using a cross of the tough, heavy and aggressive Bulldog of the 19th century with the large, strong, less aggressive Mastiff. As a result, the Bullmastiff is known as the Gamekeeper's Night Dog. The preferred color, by gamekeepers, was brindle, as this color works as a more effective camouflage, especially at night.The Bullmastiff breed was deemed pure by the English Kennel Club in 1924, with a genetic background of approximately 60% Mastiff and 40% Bulldog. In 1934, the AKC recognized the Bullmastiff. The first standard for the breed was approved in 1935. The standard has undergone several revisions since then; the most current version is available on the AKC website.In 1928, the diamond mining company De Beers imported Bullmastiffs to South Africa to guard the mines.\n\n\n== Trainability ==\nBullmastiffs are strong, powerful, but sensitive dogs. For a Bullmastiff to become a well-behaved family member, consistency is needed. Training and socialization is of high importance, as the breed can be independent. Dogs of this breed are natural guardians of their home and owners. No special guard training is needed for a Bullmastiff to react appropriately if its family is endangered. During training, a Bullmastiff requires a special approach, because these dogs do not like to repeat the same actions again and again. Activities Bullmastiffs enjoy include obedience, agility, tracking, and carting.\n\n\n== Health ==\nA UK survey based on the lifespan of 96 Bullmastiffs found a median age of 7.5 years. A Bullmastiff does not stop growing until their second birthday.\nHealth concerns within the breed include hip and elbow dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy, bloat, and cancer, with a relatively high incidence of lymphoma and mast cell tumours. Bullmastiffs are prone to certain hereditary diseases, including:\n\nHip dysplasia, affecting 24.5% of individuals \nElbow dysplasia, affecting 13.8% of individuals,\nEntropion, hypothyroidism affecting 2.8% of individuals,\nLymphoma\nProgressive retinal atrophy is a particular problem, since the trait is an autosomal dominant one. (This has recently been called into question by another medical team and has been proven that some Bullmastiffs have autosomal recessive PRA genes. In America, this is being investigated by the American Bullmastiff Health and Research Committee, and the DNA Optigen test only works for dominant genes, so it is considered inadequate at this time.)\nArthritis\nGastric dilatation volvulus, also known as bloat.Cosmetic genetic problems include longhairs and \"Dudleys\". Both are recessives and not common. The Dudley, named after a notable Bulldog breeder of the 19th century, the Earl of Dudley, is a lack of pigment in the mask. It can be liver colored or simply not present.\n\n\n== Famous Bullmastiffs ==\nRocky \u2013 Roloff family dog (Little People Big World)\nSwagger \u2013 the live mascot of the Cleveland Browns\nButkus \u2013 actual pet of actor Sylvester Stallone and featured in the movie Rocky\n\n\n== See also ==\nMastiff (disambiguation)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBullmastiff at Curlie"}, {"id": 114, "name": "Bully Kutta", "country": "Pakistan, India", "type": "", "picture": "dog114", "description": "The Bully Dog or Pakistani Mastiff (locally called as Bully Kutta, translation: Heavily Wrinkled Dog) is a breed of large-sized guard dog that originated in the Sindh province of Pakistan, dating back to 16th century.

Originating from Castile, especially in the  province of Burgos, this hardy breed is used for hunting and has some outstanding features for small game.\n\n\n== History and origin of the breed ==\nIt is an ancient breed dating back to the 16th century and originating in the Castilian plateau, which is very widespread. It is very probable that the breed participated in the creation of other races of this group.The breed is believed to have descended from a mix of the Sabueso Espa\u00f1ol and the Pachon Navarra (also known as the Perros de Punta Ibericos).\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe figure of the Burgos Pointer is perhaps not so style crystallized as other breeds in their group (such as the English Pointer), but conveys a clear sense of robustness thanks to its port square. Things to note are their long ears and two folded sheets in the form of double chin. The tail is usually cut off a third of its original length.\nColour: It has two color variations: one where the basic color is stained and/or combined with other brown and brown, where the basic color is brown which is, in this case, white spotted.\nCoat: The fur is short, bushy and smooth.\nHeight: Males from  62 to 67 centimetres (24 to 26 inches)  and females from 59 to 64 centimetres (23 to 25 inches).\nWeight:  25 to 30 kilograms (55 to 66 pounds).\n\n\n== Care ==\nIf kept in its natural environment of care that requests are rare, given its perfect adaptation to its environment. Like so many other breeds of hunting dogs require daily exercise and large doses of wide open spaces where they run.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nIt is a gentle and quiet dog who is rarely easily startled. It is not a dog that fits well in urban environments.\n\n\n== Training ==\nIt is intelligent and learns easily it comes to their job hunting.\n\n\n== Utility ==\nLike many other breeds of this group, this is a dog hunter, used in exclusive countryside environments, and has not been used in other purposes. Within this hunting breed is described as \"trace and shows\" (by its smell so). It is used for both hunting hair (rabbits, hares, etc.). and feather (birds). It is perfect for hunting in any terrain (hard as it is) because it has an enviable physical endurance and speed.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 116, "name": "Cairn Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom, Scotland", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog116", "description": "The Cairn Terrier is one of the oldest terrier breeds, originating in the Scottish Highlands and recognized as one of Scotland's earliest working dogs. The breed was given the name Cairn, because the breed's function was to hunt and chase quarry between the cairns in the Scottish highlands.Although the breed had existed long before, the name 'Cairn Terrier' was a compromise suggestion after the breed was originally brought to official shows in the United Kingdom in 1909 under the name Short-haired Skye terriers. This name was not acceptable to The Kennel Club due to opposition from Skye Terrier breeders, and the name 'Cairn Terrier' was suggested as an alternative. They are usually left-pawed, which has been shown in dogs to correlate to superior performance in tasks related to scent. Cairn terriers are ratters.\n\n\n== History ==\nCairns originated in the Highlands of Scotland and the Isle of Skye, initially grouped in the \"Skye Terrier\" class alongside the Scottish and West Highland White terriers. In the early 1900s, the three breeds began to be bred separately.\nThe Kennel Club of the United Kingdom gave the Cairn Terrier a separate register in 1912; the first year of recognition, 134 were registered and it was in that year that the breed was also given Championship status.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Cairn Terrier has a harsh weather-resistant outer coat that can be black, cream, wheaten, red, sandy, gray, or brindled in any of these colors. Pure black, black and tan, and white are not permitted by many kennel clubs. While registration of white Cairns was once permitted, after 1917, the American Kennel Club required them to be registered as West Highland White Terriers. A notable characteristic of Cairns is that brindled Cairns frequently change colour throughout their lifetimes. It is not uncommon for a brindled Cairn to become progressively more black or silver as it ages. The Cairn is double-coated, with a soft, dense undercoat and a harsh outer coat. A well-groomed Cairn has a rough-and-ready appearance, free of artifice or exaggeration. The Cairn Terrier was registered into the American Kennel Club in 1903.\n\nCairn terriers tend to look similar to a Norwich Terrier, but with some differences (for example the shaggy fur). Their outer layer of fur is shaggy, but they have a soft, downy undercoat. Their ideal weight is also 4.5-7.3 kg (10-16 lb), and the height 9\u201313 in (23\u201333 cm).\n\n\n== Grooming ==\n\nCairn terriers shed very little, but should always be hand stripped. Using scissors or shears can ruin the dog's rugged outer coat after one grooming. Hand stripping involves pulling the old dead hair out by the roots. If done incorrectly, this can cause discomfort to the dog, causing it to shy away from future hand stripping. Removing the dead hair in this manner allows new growth to come in. This new growth helps protect the dog from water and dirt.\nCairn terrier ancestors are from Scotland, where the wire coat repels water and keeps the dog dry even in rainy or damp climates.  Keeping the Cairn terrier coat in its original state will prevent possible skin irritations.  As dead hair is removed by stripping the coat, new growth comes in and the skin and coat remain healthy. Clipper-cutting a Cairn might destroy the protective wire coat unique to this breed.\nIt is wise to have a pet examined to rule out heritable skin diseases if a Cairn is obtained from unknown sources (i.e. pet stores, rescues, or puppy mills).\n\n\n== Health ==\nThese dogs are generally healthy and live on average about 12 to 17 years.\n\n\n=== Survey ===\nBreeders, owners, and veterinarians have identified several health problems that are significant for Cairns. Some of these diseases are hereditary, while others occur as a result of nonspecific factors (i.e. infections, toxins, injuries, or advanced age).\nCurrently, the Cairn Terrier Club of America, along with the Institute for Genetic Disease Control in Animals, maintains an open registry for Cairn terriers in hopes of reducing the occurrence of hereditary diseases within the breed. Breeders voluntarily submit their dogs' test results for research purposes, as well as for use by individuals who seek to make sound breeding decisions.\nSome of the more common hereditary health problems found in the Cairn are:\nBronchoesophageal fistula\nCataracts\nCorneal dystrophy\nCraniomandibular osteopathy (lion jaw)\nDiabetes mellitus\nEntropion\nHip dysplasia\nHypothyroidism\nKrabbe disease (globoid cell leukodystrophy)\nLegg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes syndrome\nLens luxation\nLuxating patella\nOcular melanosis\nPortosystemic shunt\nProgressive retinal atrophy\nSoft tissue sarcoma\nVon Willebrand disease\n\n\n== Living conditions ==\n\nCairn terriers exist happily in an apartment if sufficiently exercised. They are very active indoors and suffice even without a yard.  Daily walks  help keep Cairn terriers happy and healthy. Fenced-in yards are strongly recommended for safety and well being as well as being kept on leash when not in the yard.\nCairn terriers are particularly easily trained; ethical breeders  strongly suggest obedience school or some other type of training to direct Cairn terrier's focus on the owner as the one in command if they are going to be used for hunting. If allowed to take control of the household, behavior problems may develop that can only be resolved by hiring a professional dog trainer.  Many breeders only sell puppies to dedicated dog owners who agree to basic obedience school.\n\n\n== Exercise ==\nCairns are active dogs, thus need a daily walk.  Play takes care of a lot of their exercise needs; however, as with all breeds, play will not fulfill their primal instinct to walk. Dogs which do not get to go on daily walks are more likely to display behavior problems. They also enjoy a good romp in a safe open area off leash, such as a large fenced yard.\nAccording to Temple Grandin in her book Animals Make Us Human, dogs need 45 minutes to one hour per day of playing and seeking. Being a new owner of one, play time is more like 2 hours a day for this feisty lovable little breed.  After fulfilling this, dogs become balanced and well-mannered. Obedience school is often a good start to creating interactive play using words or commands for a dog to perform specific actions on cue.  Teaching a Cairn terrier tricks is also a clever way to direct their active energy into acceptable controlled dog games.\n\n\n== Famous Cairns ==\n\nTerry, the dog that played Toto in the 1939 screen adaptation of The Wizard of Oz, was a brindle Cairn terrier. Due to the identification of the State of Kansas with the original story The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, a resident of Wichita has begun a drive to make the Cairn terrier the official dog of Kansas. Terry also had a role in the Shirley Temple film Bright Eyes, and 12 other films.\n\n\n=== In media ===\nIn I Love Lucy,  Little Ricky had a Cairn terrier named Fred.\nIn Pal Joey, the character played by Frank Sinatra had a Cairn terrier named Snuffy. Snuffy was played by a dog named Danny; Danny also starred as Fred, the Ricardo's dog referenced above.\nJ. Edgar Hoover notably bred Cairn terriers and gifted them to high ranking government officials during his career.\nUK TV presenter Paul O'Grady often features a Cairn terrier called Olga on his primetime chat show; dark in colour, Olga is a rescue dog.\nAlso in the UK, Pauline Fowler actress Wendy Richard in the BBC TV show EastEnders had a Cairn she fondly named Betty.  Betty made an appearance as Toto on BBC's \"Strictly Come Dancing\" (series 10) after Vincent Simone and his celebrity partner Dani Harmer danced a waltz to \"Over the Rainbow\" from The Wizard of Oz.\nGeorge Lopez's family dog on the ABC TV series George Lopez, is a Cairn terrier named Mr. Needles, named by the son, Max, for the extremely high number of shots that the incredibly sick former stray received from the veterinarian.\nPortrait of a Lady, Nicole Kidman, Cairn Terrier throughout movie \nAustralian television soap series Neighbours had a Cairn terrier named Audrey which belonged to the character Libby Kennedy.\nThe character of Romulus, owned by Ray Milland's character, Steven Tolliver, in Cecil B.

There are 2,000 to 3,000 Canaan dogs across the world, mostly in Europe and North America.\n\n\n== History ==\nExcavations in Ashkelon unearthed the Ashkelon dog cemetery, the largest known animal cemetery in the ancient world, containing 700 dog skeletons all of which were anatomically similar to the Canaan dog of modern times. Archaeologists hypothesize that the dogs were revered as sacred animals.According to tradition, the Canaan dog was the guard and herd dog of the ancient Israelites, guarding their camps and flocks. At the time of the Diaspora, this tradition continues, the Israelites were forcefully removed from their land and had to leave behind their dogs. These dogs reverted to the wild. Avoiding extinction, they remained undomesticated for the most part, although some lived with the Bedouins and earned their keep by guarding the herds and camps. Some were also guards for the Druze on Mount Carmel.\nDr. Rudolphina Menzel (1891\u20131973) used these intelligent scavenger dogs mainly found in the desert as guard dogs. In the 1930s Menzel was asked by the Haganah to build up a service dog organization. She captured a select group of semi-wild individuals, tamed, trained and bred them. Menzel found the dogs highly adaptable, trainable, and easy to domesticate. It took her about six months to capture her first dog, Dugma, and within a few weeks she was able to take him into town and on buses.She began a breeding program in 1934, providing working dogs for the military and she gave pups to be pets and home guard dogs. She initiated a selective breeding program to produce the breed known today as the Canaan dog.\n\nIn 1949 Menzel founded The Institute for Orientation and Mobility of the Blind, and in 1953, she started to train Canaan dogs as guide dogs for the blind. Although she was able to train several dogs, she found that the breed was too independent and too small for general guide dog use, although some of her dogs were used successfully by children.\nHer breeding program was concentrated with the Institute, where a foundation of kennel-raised Canaan dogs was established, carrying the name \"B'nei Habitachon\". She later supplied breeding stock to Shaar Hagai Kennels which continued in the breeding of the Canaan dog. After her death in 1973, Shaar Hagai Kennels, managed by Dvora Ben Shaul and Myrna Shiboleth, continued the breeding program according to her instructions. In addition, a controlled collection of dogs of the original type was continued, primarily from the Bedouin of the Negev.Collection of wild Canaan dogs has become very difficult. Many of the Canaan dogs living in the open were destroyed by the Israeli government in the fight against rabies. The spread of the human population into areas that were formerly isolated, along with their pet dogs, has resulted in the loss of the natural habitat of the Canaan. Even the majority of Bedouin dogs today, other than those of tribes still living a traditional and isolated life style, are mixed with other breeds. Myrna Shiboleth visits the Negev regularly, looking for good specimens living by the Bedouin camps, that she can breed with her dogs and use to strengthen the gene pool.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Canaan dog is a typical primitive dog in appearance. It is a medium-sized square built dog, with a wedge-shaped head, erect and low set ears with a broad base and rounded tips. Its outer coat is dense, harsh and straight of short to medium-length. The undercoat should be close and profuse according to season. Color ranges from black to cream and all shades of brown and red between, usually with small white markings, or all white with colour patches. Spotting of all kinds is permitted, as well as white or black masks.\nRudolphina Menzel, an immigrant to Mandate Palestine from Austria, having studied the desert free living dogs and the variations in appearances, classified these canines into four types: 1) heavy, sheepdog appearance, 2) dingo-like appearance, 3) Border Collie appearance,  4) Greyhound appearance. Menzel concluded that the Canaan dog is a derivative of the Type III pariah \u2014 the collie type (referring to the type of farm collie found in the 1930s which was a medium dog of moderate head type more similar to today's Border Collie, not the modern Rough Collie).\nIn writing the first official standard for the Canaan dog, Menzel wrote: \"Special importance must be placed on the points that differentiate the Canaan-dog from the German Shepard [sic] dog, whose highly bred form he sometimes resembles: the Canaan-dog is square, the loin region short, the forequarters highly erect, the hindquarters less angular, the neck as noble as possible, the tail curled over the back when excited, the trot is short (see also differences in head and color)\".\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nCanaan dogs have a strong survival instinct. They are quick to react and wary of strangers, and will alert to any disturbances with prompt barking, thus making them excellent watchdogs. Though defensive, they are not aggressive and are very good with children within the family, but may be wary of other children or defensive when your child is playing with another child. They are intelligent and learn quickly, but may get bored with repetitive exercises or ignore commands if they find something of more interest.\n\n\n== Skills ==\nCanaan dogs can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Canaans exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn general, the Canaan dog does not suffer from known hereditary problems. Although the breed is one of the healthiest, George A. Padgett, DVM, listed diseases that have been seen, at one time or another, in the Canaan dog: hypothyroidism, epilepsy, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), cryptorchidism, hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, luxating patella, and osteochondritis dissecans (OCD).\n\n\n== Breed recognition ==\nThe Canaan dog was first recognized by the Israel Kennel Club in 1953 and by the FCI (Federation Cynologique Internationale) in 1966. The first accepted standard was written by Dr. Menzel.\nIn 1986, the first Canaan dogs were brought to Finland from Sha'ar Hagai Kennel, in Israel.\nThe Canaan Dog is today recognized by all the world's kennel clubs and is being bred in many countries.  There are breed clubs in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Finland, Germany, Israel and France.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nThe first Canaan dog came to Canada May 16, 1970.  The dogs came from a kennel in Delaware.\nThe Canadian Canaan Club was formed in 1972, and the first executive of the Club was elected on March 15, 1973. The club has since been dissolved.\nThe Canaan dog obtained entry into the Miscellaneous Class of the Canadian Kennel Club on December 1, 1975. In January 1993, the breed was accepted in the Working Group, as the Canadian Kennel Club did not have a Herding group at that time.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe first Canaan Dog was brought to the UK from Lebanon in 1965, before they were a recognized breed.\nIn December 1970, they were recognized by the Kennel Club, and the breed was placed in the Utility Group.\nIn May 1992 the inaugural meeting of the Canaan Dog Club of the United Kingdom took place. Since 1996 the breed has begun to grow in numbers in the UK, though it is still quite numerically small.\n\n\n=== United States ===\nOn September 7, 1965, Menzel sent four dogs to Ursula Berkowitz of Oxnard, California, the first Canaan dogs in the United States. The Canaan Dog Club of America was formed the same year, and stud book records were kept from these first reports. In June 1989, the Canaan dog entered the American Kennel Club (AKC) Miscellaneous Class. Its profile was raised when John F. Kennedy Jr. purchased a Canaan dog in the 1990s. Canaan dogs were registered in the AKC Stud Book as of June 1, 1997. The dogs began competing in conformation on August 12, 1997.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWildlife of Israel\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"The Israel Canaan Dog\" (paperback) by Myrna Shiboleth (Hendelmade, 2012) www.icdb.org.il\nThe Israel Canaan Dog (2nd edition, paperback), by Myrna Shiboleth (Alpine Publications: 1996) ISBN 0-931866-71-5\nPariahunde - Pariah Dogs, by Rudolf Menzel & Rudolphina Menzel, translated by Bryna Comsky\nCanaan Dog (Kennel Club Dog Breed Series, Special Rare-breed Edition), by Joy Levine (Kennel Club Books, 2003), ISBN 1-59378-349-3\nCanaan Dog (Complete Handbook), by Lee Boyd and Victor Kaftal (Tfh Publications, 1995), ISBN 0-7938-0800-6\nControl of Canine Genetic Diseases, by Dr. George A.

Other names include qimmiq or qimmit (Inuit language word for \"dog\"). They were brought from Siberia to North America by the Thule people 1,000 years ago, along with the Greenland Dog that is genetically identical.\nThe breed is currently threatened with extinction, with a 2008 estimate of only 300 purebred dogs. Although once used as the preferred method of transportation by Inuit in the Canadian Arctic, by the 1960s traditional working dog teams became increasingly rare in the North. Contributing factors to the breed's decline include the increasing popularity of snowmobiles for transportation and the spread of infectious canine diseases. Controversy surrounds the intentional killings of a debated number of Inuit sled dogs between 1950 and 1970 by The Royal Canadian Mounted Police as well as recent efforts to increase the breed's population.\n\n\n== Lineage ==\nThe first dogs arrived in the Americas 12,000 years ago. However, people and their dogs did not settle in the Arctic until the arrival of two groups from Siberia, the Paleo-Eskimo people 4,500 years ago and the Thule people 1,000 years ago. The Inuit dogs from Canada (Canadian Eskimo Dog) and Greenland (Greenland Dog) descended from dogs associated with the Thule people, who relied on them for transportation from Siberia.\nIn 2015, a study using a number of genetic markers indicated that these were both the same dog and should not be treated as separate breeds, that they maintain an indigenous heritage that predates colonization and the timing of which corresponds with the arrival of the Thule people, and that they were distinct from Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Huskies and Malamutes. The maternal mitochondrial DNA sequences of the Inuit dogs were classified as haplotype A31 that indicates a common female ancestor. This haplotype could not be found in other modern dogs; the nearest match was with a 1,000 year\u2013old dog from Florida.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Canadian Eskimo Dog should always be powerfully built, athletic, and imposing in appearance. It should be of \"powerful physique giving the impression that he is not built for speed but rather for hard work.\" As is typical of spitz breeds, it has erect, triangular ears, and a heavily feathered tail that is carried over its back. Males should be distinctly more masculine than females, who are finer boned, smaller, and often have a slightly shorter coat.\nIts superficial similarity to wolves was often noted by explorers during the Coppermine Expedition of 1819\u20131822. They noted that the ears of the Eskimo dogs they encountered were similar to those of American wolves, and their forelegs lacked the black mark above the wrist characteristic of European wolves. The most sure way to distinguish the two species was said to be through the length and posture of the tail, which was shorter and more curved in the dog.\n\n\n==== Coat and colour ====\n\nThe coat is very thick and dense, with a soft undercoat and stiff, coarse guard hairs. The Eskimo Dog has a mane of thick fur around its neck, which is quite impressive in the males and adds an illusion of additional size. This mane is smaller in females. Eskimo Dogs can be almost any colour, and no one colour or colour pattern should dominate. Solid white dogs are often seen, as well as white dogs with patches of another colour on the head or both body and head. Solid silver or black coloured dogs are common as well. Many of the solid coloured dogs have white mask-like markings on the face, sometimes with spots over the eyes. Others might have white socks and nose stripes with no eye spots or mask.\n\n\n==== Size ====\nThe size of Canadian Eskimo dogs depends on their sex. Males weigh 30\u201340 kg (66\u201388 lb) and stand 58\u201370 cm (23\u201328 in) at the shoulder. Females weigh 18\u201330 kg (40\u201366 lb) and stand 50\u201360 cm (20\u201324 in).\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Canadian Eskimo Dog's temperament reflects its original work and environment. It is loyal, tough, brave, intelligent, and alert. It is affectionate and gentle, and develops a deep bond with its owner and is intensely loyal. When used as sled dogs, they were often required to forage and hunt for their own food. Consequently, many Canadian Eskimo Dogs have stronger prey drive than some other breeds. Owing to their original environment, they take pure delight in cold weather, often preferring to sleep outside in winter. Like most spitz breeds they can be very vocal.\n\n\n== Care and training ==\nCanadian Eskimo Dogs need a very large amount of exercise. They cannot just be walked, they need higher intensity work, requiring more exercise than many dog owners can give. This need for work and stimulation makes them well-suited for dog sports, such as carting, mushing, and skijoring. They are very trainable and submissive, unlike many spitz breeds, as well as intelligent. The Canadian Eskimo Dog is best kept in a cold climate, and is prone to heatstroke. Its coat is fairly easy to care for most times of the year, needing brushing only one or two times a week. However, when it sheds (which happens once a year) it will need grooming every day.\nHistorically, Inuit would put their dogs to the harness as soon as they could walk, and would acquire the habit of pulling sledges in their attempts to break free. At the age of two months, the pups would be placed with adult dogs. Sometimes, ten pups would be put under the lead of an older animal, coupled with frequent beatings from their masters, which would educate the pups.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nInuit never considered the dog as part of the animal kingdom (uumajuit), but merely as a tool for human existence. It was, and still is (to a very limited extent), used by the Canadian Inuit as multi-purpose dogs, often put to work hunting seals and other Arctic game, and hauling supplies and people. Explorers noted that the dogs were capable of tracking a seal hole from a great distance, and were occasionally used to hunt polar bears. The dogs were reported to be so enthusiastic in hunting bears that, sometimes, their handlers shouted \"nanuq\" (Inuktitut name for the bear) to encourage them when pulling sledges.\nThe dogs however would not pursue wolves, and would howl fearfully at their approach. Frozen dog urine was used by Inuit as a medicine, and their fur was more prized than that of wolves, due to its greater resistance to wear. In times of famine, the dogs would be used as an emergency food source. Though once assumed to be a tamed wolf or wolf-dog hybrid by explorers, including Charles Darwin due to similarities in appearance and vocalisations, genetic testing has shown that the Eskimo dog has no recent wolf ancestry.\n\nThe breed is currently threatened with extinction. In the 19th century and early 20th century, this breed was still in demand for polar expeditions, and approximately 20,000 dogs lived in the Canadian Arctic in the 1920s. However, the breed had declined significantly by the 1960s. The breed had once been accepted for showing by both the American Kennel Club (AKC) and the Canadian Kennel Club (CKC), however in 1959 the AKC dropped the breed from its registry because of extremely low numbers. The Canadian Eskimo Dog and Greenland Greenland Dog are sometimes considered the same breed by authorities, although the Greenland Dog can be criticized for lacking any proper breeding program, questioning its validity as a pure breed.Since the 1970s, the Eskimo Dog Research Foundation (EDRF) and Brian Ladoon have worked to increase the breed's numbers. The EDRF was founded in 1972 by William Carpenter and John McGrath and was largely funded by the Canadian Government and the Northwest Territories Government, with some support from the CKC. The EDRF purchased dogs from the small (about 200 dogs) population remaining in the Canadian Arctic from remote Inuit camps on Baffin Island, Boothia Peninsula, and Melville Peninsula. The EDRF then began breeding dogs in order to increase numbers. \n\nBrian Ladoon also bought dogs in the 1970s from the northern communities of Canada and started breeding after being given the mission of saving them by Bishop Omer Alfred Robidoux of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Churchill-Baie d'Hudson. He switched from Malamutes and Huskies to the CED, and after breeding for 30 years still has the largest genetic stock colony of Canadian Eskimo Dogs in the world. The modern breed originated from a relatively high number of founders, thus ensuring sufficient genetic variability to avoid inbreeding.\nThe Canadian Eskimo Dog is currently used in sled dog teams that entertain tourists and for commercial polar bear hunting.  By law, polar bear hunting in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut must be conducted by dog team or on foot. The requirement is partly for safety reasons; the working dog can better sense when a polar bear is around, whereas the sound of a snowmobile motor masks any sign of a polar bear. On May 1, 2000, the Canadian territory of Nunavut officially adopted the \"Canadian Inuit Dog\" as the animal symbol of the territory, thus sealing the name of their traditional dog (qimmiq) in the Inuktitut language.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== RCMP dog killings ===\nBetween 1950 and 1970, The Royal Canadian Mounted Police intentionally killed Inuit sled dogs. Estimates of the number of dogs killed range from 1,200 to 20,000.  In some communities elders have alleged that this destruction was conducted in order to intimidate the Inuit and to intentionally disrupt their way of life. In response to these allegations, in 2005 the RCMP conducted an internal investigation on the killings.  Its report concluded that dogs were indeed killed, but for public health purposes - to remove sick, dangerous, and suffering animals. However, the report also acknowledged that the RCMP rarely followed ordinances that required dogs to first be captured and owners to be notified before killings, that owners had no recourse against unreasonable killings, and that the justification for killings were not always explained to the Inuit. The report denies that any dogs were killed as part of a plot against the Inuit. The Qikiqtani Inuit Association denounced the report as \"biased, flawed and incomplete.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nGreenland Dog\nAmerican Eskimo Dog\nNorthern Breed Group\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n[2]\nCanadian Eskimo Dog Club of Great Britain\nCanadian Inuit/Eskimo Dog Network\nInuit Sled Dog International\nCanadian Inuit (Eskimo) Dog\nThe Fan Hitch, Website and Journal of the Inuit Sled Dog\nThe Inuit Dog: Its Provenance, Environment and History"}, {"id": 119, "name": "Cane Corso", "country": "Italy", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog119", "description": "The Cane Corso (pronounced kah-neh kor-so [\u02c8ka\u02d0ne \u02c8k\u0254rso]) from Italian cane (dog) and \"corso\" from the Latin \"Cohors\" meaning \"protector\",  also known as the Italian Mastiff, is a large Italian breed of dog, for years valued highly in Italy as a companion and guard dog.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Cane Corso is a large Italian Molosser, which is closely related to the Neapolitan Mastiff. In name and form the Cane Corso predates its cousin the Neapolitan Mastiff. It is well muscled and less bulky than most other Mastiff breeds. The breed is known as a true and quite possibly the last of the coursing Mastiffs. The official F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) standard expects ideal dogs to stand 58\u201370 cm (23\u201328 in) at the withers, with females in the lower range  (58\u201366 cm (23\u201326 in)) and males in the higher (62\u201370 cm (24\u201328 in)). Weight should be in keeping with the size and stature of these dogs, ranging from 45\u201350 kilograms (99\u2013110 lb) for males and from 40\u201345 kilograms (88\u201399 lb) for females. The overall impression should be of power, balanced with athleticism. A Corso should be moderately tight skinned; however, some dewlap on the neck is normal, and the bottom of the jawline should be defined by the hanging lip.The head of the Cane Corso is arguably its most important feature. It is large and imposing.  The forehead should be flat and convergent to the muzzle. The muzzle is flat, rectangular (when viewed from above), and generally as wide as it is long; approximately 33% the total length of the skull (a ratio of 2:1). The eyes are almond in shape, set straight and when viewed from the front, set slightly above the line of the muzzle. Darker eyes are preferred, however, the color of the eyes tends to emulate the shade of brindling in the coat. Traditionally the ears are  cropped short in equilateral triangles that stand erect. However, as cropping is no longer legal in many jurisdictions, Cane Corso with ears are becoming more common, and should hang smoothly against the head, coming to at or slightly below the level of the eyes.The tail of the Corso is traditionally docked fairly long, at the 4th vertebra.  Again, with trends in cosmetic surgeries for dogs changing, many Corsos now have full tails, which should be carried erect, but never curled over the back.Cane Corso appear in two basic coat colours: black and fawn. This is further modified by genetic pigment dilution to create \"blue\" (grey, from black) and frumentino or formentino (from fawn, where the mask is blue/grey) colours. Brindling of varying intensity is common on both basic coat colours as well, creating Tigrato (black brindle), and Grigio Tigrato (blue brindle).  White markings are common on the chest, tips of toes, the chin, and the bridge of the nose. Large white patches are not desirable.A 2017 study of 232 Cane Corso dogs across 25 countries found an average life span of 9.3 years, varying with different coat colours. The longest living were black brindle dogs (10.3 years) followed by brindle dogs (10.1 years), grey brindle dogs (9.8 years), fawn dogs (9.0 years), black dogs (9.0 years), grey dogs (9.0 years) and other colour dogs (8.1 years).\n\n\n=== Behavior ===\nThese dogs are docile and affectionate to their owners, loving with children and family, and easily trained. They are an unequalled protector of the owners and their property.\n\n\n=== Birth and Reproduction ===\nThe average litter size of Cane Corso is 4 to 6 puppies.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Cane Corso is a descendant of the old Roman molosser.. Its name derives from cane da corso, an old term for those catch dogs used in rural activities for cattle and swine, as distinct from cane da camera which indicates the catch dog kept as a bodyguard. In the recent past, its distribution was limited to some regions of Southern Italy, especially in Basilicata, Campania, and Apulia.Cane Corso were used to guard property, livestock, and families, and some continue to be used for this purpose today. Historically it has also been used by night watchmen, keepers, and, in the past, by carters and drovers.  In the more distant past this breed was common all over Italy, as an ample iconography and historiography testify.As life changed in the southern Italian rural farms in the 20th century, the Corso began to become rare.  A group of enthusiasts began recovery activities designed to bring the dog back from near extinction in the late 1970s.  By 1994, the breed was fully accepted by the Italian Kennel Club (ENCI) as the 14th Italian breed of dog.  The FCI provisionally accepted the Corso in 1997, and ten years later was fully recognised internationally.  In the US, the American Kennel Club first recognized the Cane Corso in 2010. The popularity of the breed continues to grow, ranking in 40th place in the United States in 2016, a jump from 50th place in 2013 and 60th in 2012  Today the breed is used as a guardian, protection, tracking and police dog.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCane Corso at Curlie"}, {"id": 120, "name": "Cantabrian Water Dog", "country": "Spain", "type": "", "picture": "dog120", "description": "The Cantabrian Water Dog (Spanish: perro de agua cant\u00e1brico) is a landrace breed of dog developed in the coast of Cantabria, northern Spain, as an assistant to fishermen. The breed was classified and recognized by the Breeds Committee of the Spanish Ministry of Environment on 22 March 2011.\n\n\n== History of the variety ==\n\nThe Cantabrian Water Dog is an ancestral population in the north of the Iberian Peninsula, whose origins seem to be common to Barbet. The breed is socially, culturally and historically rooted in the towns and villages of the whole coast of Cantabria and eastern Asturias. The work of this breed has been traditionally related to fishing work: collecting fishes that fell into the water, watching the ships when they were moored in port, taking the rope between ships and to the dock, or acting like a lifeguard.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe population of Cantabrian Water Dog shows a clear morphological and genetic differentiation that allows discrimination from other dog populations in the same group with close geographic distribution. Genetic studies place it as close to the Spanish Water Dog as to the Barbet or Caniche.These animals are lighter and shorter than those of the Spanish breed, where they were previously included. Thus, 75% of males and 38% of females would be excluded from the breed standard for height at the withers, while using the criterion of weight, 91% of males and 80% females would be excluded.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCantabrian Water Dog Association (in Spanish)"}, {"id": 121, "name": "C\u00e3o da Serra de Aires", "country": "Portugal", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog121", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 122, "name": "C\u00e3o de Castro Laboreiro", "country": "Portugal", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog122", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 123, "name": "C\u00e3o de Gado Transmontano", "country": "Portugal", "type": "", "picture": "dog123", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 124, "name": "C\u00e3o Fila de S\u00e3o Miguel", "country": "Portugal", "type": "", "picture": "dog124", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 125, "name": "Carolina Dog", "country": "United States", "type": "Sighthound and Pariah", "picture": "dog125", "description": "The Carolina dog, also known as a yellow dog, yaller dog, American Dingo, or Dixie Dingo, is a breed of medium-sized, feral dog that lives mostly in the Southeastern United States, especially in isolated stretches of longleaf pines and cypress swamps. Rehoming of Carolina dogs has recently become popular, and they can make good domestic pets with proper socialization.  Since 2008, artificial selection efforts to establish them as a standardized breed (usually capitalized as Carolina Dog) has made some progress, with recognition in two smaller national kennel clubs, and acceptance into the breed-establishment program of a major one.\nOriginally a landrace breed, the Carolina dog was rediscovered living as free-roaming population by I. Lehr Brisbin Jr., though originally documented in American dog-related publications in the 1920s. Carolina dogs show admixture with other dog breeds from Eurasia.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nOne of the earliest publications to document the \"Indian\" dogs of North America was the article \"Dogs of the American Aborigines\" by Glover Morrill Allen, published in 1920 by the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College.  Allen postulated that these \"Larger or Common Indian Dogs\" were descended from Asian primitive dogs: \"The probability therefore is, that the Domestic Dog originated in Asia and was carried by primitive man both east and west into all parts of the inhabited world. That this migration began in late Pleistocene times seems highly probable.\" Allen cites late nineteenth-century studies of skeletal remains of dogs that could be found from Alaska to Florida to the Greater Antilles and westward to the Great Plains, and were excavated from Indian mounds as well:\n\nCope (1893) was the first to describe the jaw of this dog from a specimen collected by Moore from a shell-mound on St. John's River, Florida. He was struck by the fact that the first lower premolar was missing and appeared not to have developed. He also noticed strong development of the entoconid of the carnassial.Moore, in the course of various explorations in Florida and Georgia discovered many remains of dogs, apparently of this type. In a large mound on Ossabaw Island, Georgia, he (1897) found several interments of human and dog-skeletons, the latter always buried separately and entire, showing that the dogs had not been used as food. Other dog-skeletons of a similar sort were found by Moore (1899) in aboriginal mounds on the South Carolina coast ... Putnam considered them the same as the larger Madisonville (Ohio) dogs.\n\nThese dogs were publicized by I. Lehr Brisbin Jr., a senior research ecologist at the University of Georgia's Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, who first came across a Carolina dog while working at the Savannah River Site, which by design was depopulated and secured of all trespass and traffic for decades beginning in 1950.\n\n\n== Establishment and recognition of the Carolina Dog as a standardized breed ==\n\nSince 1996, Carolinas can be registered with the United Kennel Club (UKC), which has published a detailed, formal Carolina Dog breed standard.. UKC focuses on hunting dogs and other working dogs, and categorizes the Carolina in their \"Sighthound and Pariah\" group, along with other breeds such as the Basenji of Africa and the Thai Ridgeback. A breed standard has also been issued by the American Rare Breed Association (ARBA). ARBA includes the Carolina in their Group 5 along with the Canaan dog and the New Guinea singing dog.In July 2017, the American Kennel Club (AKC, the largest dog breed registry in the United States) accepted the Carolina Dog breeding program into its Foundation Stock Service (FSS), the first step toward official AKC breed recognition. AKC has the dog listed under their \"Hound\" group.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nCarolina dogs are a medium sized; height ranges from 17 to 24 inches (45\u201361 cm), and weight from 30 to 65 pounds (15\u201320 kg). The ears are characteristic and are erect, very long, and moderately slender, tapering way up to elegantly pointed tips and they can be individually turned to the direction of any sound, providing extremely sensitive hearing.\nThe dog ranges in build from muscular yet slender and graceful to somewhat stockier animals. The dogs legs are also graceful but strong. The hind midsection is firm and narrow. The overall build in a healthy, properly fed Carolina dog is svelte to somewhat stockier, strong and athletic. Paws are relatively large. The snout and the notably elongated, fox-like ears are spitz-like. The tail is usually upturned and often has a hooked kink in it. The coat is usually short and smooth, characteristic of a warm-climate dog.\nColors vary, and may include reddish ginger, buff, fawn, black-and-tan, or piebald with or without white areas on toes, chest, tail tip and muzzle. The eyes are at an oblique angle and almond shaped. The eyes vary in color, but are usually dark brown or medium to dark orange. The area along the edges of the eyes is often (but not always) a distinctive black \"eyeliner\" coloration which becomes more pronounced by contrast in lighter-colored dogs. The lips are often black, even in light-colored dogs. Frequently, puppies have a melanistic mask that usually fades as the adult coat comes in.\n\n\n== Behavior and temperament ==\n\n\n=== Breeding in the wild ===\nFemale Carolina dogs have three estrus cycles in quick succession, which settle into seasonal reproductive cycles when there is an abundance of puppies. This is thought to ensure quick breeding in the wild before diseases, like heartworm, take their toll.Some pregnant dogs also dig dens in which to give birth. Unlike domesticated dogs, wolves, or coyotes, pregnant female Carolina dogs may dig elaborate dens. After giving birth or while pregnant, the dog carefully pushes sand with her snout to cover her excrement. This also helps to evade wolves and coyotes, showing further behavioral adaptation to the wild. Brisbin noted that only the Australian dingo and one ancient Korean breed of dog exhibit this behavior.\n\n\n=== Hunting ===\nThe Carolina dog is highly proficient at locating prey with its elongated, swiveling, radar-like ears, and is equally proficient at catching small mammals, such as shrews and mice, using a pouncing technique similar to foxes. The dog also digs \"snout pits\" or \"nose holes\" \u2013 numerous of tiny holes in the dirt that perfectly fit its muzzle \u2013 usually for hunting small rodents, insects, or grubs, or to eat soil minerals. (More female dogs dig these than males.)\n\n\n== DNA evidence ==\n\nIn 2013, a study looked at the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes associated with samples of the Carolina dog.\nThe study showed that 58% of the dogs carried universal haplotypes that could be found around the world (haplotypes A16, A18, A19, and B1), 5% carried haplotypes associated with Korea and Japan (A39), and 37% carried a unique haplotype that was not recorded before (A184) and that relates to the a5 mtDNA sub-haplogroup that originated in East Asia. As the Australian dingo and the New Guinea singing dog belong to haplotype A29 that relates to the a2 sub-haplogroup, there is no genetic relationship in the mtDNA. Also in 2013, another study of several dog breeds in the Americas \u2014 among them the Carolina dog, the  Peruvian Hairless Dog and the Chihuahua indicated an ancient migration from Asia.In 2015, a study was conducted using mitochondrial (female lineage marker), Y-chromosome (male lineage marker), and autosomal genetic markers in 4,676 purebred dogs from 161 breeds and 549 village dogs from 38 countries. The study tested for the degree of admixture with European breed dogs. The study found no yDNA haplotypes that were indigenous to North American dogs outside of the Arctic. However, the mtDNA of Carolina dogs contained between 10% and 35% pre-Columbian ancestry (mtDNA haplotype A184) that clustered with East Asian dogs.Brisbin proposed that the some of the Carolina dog's ancestors arrived with the first, prehistoric Americans.\nIn 2018, a study compared sequences of fossil North American dogs with fossil Siberian dogs and modern dogs. The study indicates that dogs entered North America from Siberia 4,500 years after humans did, were isolated for 9,000 years, and after contact with Europeans these no longer exist because they were replaced with Eurasian dogs. The pre-contact dogs exhibit a unique genetic signature that is also now gone, with their nearest genetic relatives being the arctic breed dogs. Three Carolina dogs in the study exhibited up to 33% pre-contact/arctic lineage, however the study could not rule out this being the result of admixture with modern Arctic breed dogs.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFree-ranging dog\nPariah dog\nNative American dogs\nRare breed (dog)\nRez dog\nYellow dog Democrat\nNureongi\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial United Kennel Club site, Breed information on Carolina dog"}, {"id": 126, "name": "Carpathian Shepherd Dog", "country": "Romania", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog126", "description": "The Carpathian Shepherd Dog (Ciob\u0103nesc Rom\u00e2nesc Carpatin) is a breed of large sheep dogs that originated in the Carpathian Mountains of Romania.\n\n\n== History ==\nAlfred Edmund Brehm (1829-1885) in (Animal's Life) wrote about these dogs. The first data regarding the Romanian Carpathian Shepherd Dog was recorded in the Veterinary Science Magazine, year XV, No. 2.\nIn March 1998, a group of fans of the Carpathian Shepherd Dog founded the Carpathian Shepherd Dogs Club. The club was later renamed the National Club of Carpathian Shepherd Dog Breeders.  The club observed that there many Carpathians in Ruc\u0103r, Arge\u015f County that are considered ancestors of today's Carpathians.\nIn March 2003, at Bistri\u0163a, an important conference of the factors involved in the Romanian breeds took place.

Also known as the Catahoula Leopard Dog or Louisiana Catahoula, it became the state dog of Louisiana in 1979. The breed is sometimes referred to as the \"Catahoula Hound\" or \"Catahoula Leopard Hound\" because of its spots, although it is not a true hound but a cur. It is also called the \"Catahoula Hog Dog\", reflecting its traditional use in hunting wild boar.\n\n\n== History ==\nBoth the Catahoula lineage and the origins of the name \"Catahoula\" are uncertain, but there are various theories.\nOne theory posits that the Catahoula is the result of Native Americans having bred their own dogs with molossers and greyhounds brought to Louisiana by Hernando de Soto in the 16th century. As for the aforementioned Native American dog breeds, for a time it was believed that they were bred with or from red wolves, but this idea is not supported by modern DNA analysis. Several recent studies have looked at the remains of prehistoric dogs from American archaeological sites and each has indicated that the genetics of prehistoric American dogs are similar to European and Asian domestic dogs rather than wild New World canids. In fact, these studies indicate that Native Americans brought several lines (breeds) of already domesticated dogs with them on their journeys from Asia to North America.Another theory suggests that the breed originated three centuries later, some time in the 19th century, after French settlers introduced the Beauceron to the North American continent. The French told of strange-looking dogs with haunting glass eyes that were used by the Indians to hunt game in the swamp, and the theory states that the Beauceron and the Red Wolf/war dog were interbred to produce the Catahoula.\nThere are two theories regarding the origin of the word 'Catahoula.' One theory is that the word is a combination of two Choctaw words 'okhata', meaning lake, and 'hullo', meaning beloved. Another possibility is that the word is a French transformation of the Choctaw Indian word for their own nation, 'Couthaougoula' pronounced 'Coot-ha-oo-goo-la'.(Don Abney)\nIn 1979, Governor Edwin Edwards signed a bill making the Catahoula the official state dog of Louisiana in recognition of their importance in the history of the region.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nAs a working dog, Catahoulas have been bred primarily for temperament and ability rather than for appearance. As a result, the physical characteristics of the Catahoula are somewhat varied.\n\n\n=== Size ===\nCatahoulas may range greatly in size with males averaging slightly larger than females. Typical height ranges from 20\u201326 inches (51\u201366 cm) and weight from 40\u2013112 pounds (18\u201351 kg).\n\n\n=== Color ===\n\nCatahoulas come in many different colors including blue merle, red merle, brindle, and solid colors. Often, solid coat Catahoulas have small splashes of other colors such as white on their face, legs or chest. The leopard-like coat of most Catahoulas is the result of the merle gene. The merle gene does not normally affect the entire coat of the dog, but dilutes the color only in areas that randomly present the characteristic of the gene. Visually, white coats seem unaffected.\n\nRed Leopard: These are various shades of brown and tan, may also have white. Known as \"red merle\" in other breeds.\nBlue Leopard: These are various shades of dark greys, black and some may also have white (generally on the feet and chest). Known as \"blue merle\" in other breeds.\nBlack or Black Leopard: These are leopards least affected by the merle gene but will display smaller patches of blue or gray.\nGray or Silver Leopard: Blue Leopards where the black color has been diluted to gray. Known as \"slate merle\" in other breeds.\nTri-color: Catahoulas with three distinct visible colors, usually white, black, and gray.\nQuad-color: These are Catahoulas with the varying body colorations and trim colors that help to designate the number of colors present on the dogs. Gray Catahoulas may be considered a Quad-color when White and Tan trim are included. This dog would display Black, Gray, White, usually around the neck, face, feet, and tail, and Tan, which may also appear around the face and feet. Most Five-colored dogs are misnamed Quad-colored dogs.\nPatchwork: These Catahoulas are predominantly white dogs with small amounts of solid and/or merle patches appearing throughout the coat. The colored patches may be black or brown. Dilution may affect those colored patches and produce gray, blue, red, or liver coloration within them.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\n\nThe texture of a Catahoula's coat may show some variance, being slick/painted-on, spotted, or coarse.  All registering bodies that recognize the Catahoula specify a short or slick-coated dog. \nSlick coat: This is the most common coat type, featuring fur that is very short and lies close to the body. Such coats dry very rapidly, and because of this, the dog can be cleaned and ready in a matter of minutes.  It is often referred to as a \"Wash n' Wear\" coat.\nCoarse coat: This coat is a little longer and fuller than others. It does not require complex maintenance; however, these dogs are not quick to dry when wet. Dogs with this type of coat will often display \"feathers\" seen on the rear legs, tail, and underbelly, giving them a \"fluffy\" appearance.\n\n\n=== Eyes ===\nThe breed may have \"cracked glass\" or \"marbled glass\" eyes (heterochromia) and occurs when both colored and glass portions are present in the same eye. Cracked glass or marbled glass eyes are blue or blue-white in color. Catahoulas with two cracked glass or marble glass eyes are often referred to as having double glass eyes. In some cases, a glass eye will have darker colored sections in it, and vice versa. Cracked glass eyes may be half of one color and half of another. They may just have a streak or spot of another color. Gray eyes are usually cracked glass eyes, made of blue and green, giving them their grayish appearance. The eyes may be of the same color or each of a different color. Eye color can also be ice blue, brown, green, gray, or amber. No particular eye color is typical of Catahoulas. Some have been known to have half of one eye marbled.\n\n\n=== Tail ===\nThe tail of the Catahoula may be long and whip-like, reaching past the hocks of the back legs, or else bobtail, which is a tail that ranges from one vertebra shorter than full length to only one vertebra in total length. The question mark tail is a common tail trait, often with a white tip. The bobtail is a rare but natural part of the Catahoula heritage.\n\n\n=== Feet ===\nThough most dogs have webbing between the toes, Catahoulas' feet have more prominent webbing which extends almost to the ends of the toes. This foot gives the Catahoula the ability to work marshy areas and gives them great swimming ability.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nCatahoulas are highly intelligent and energetic. They are assertive dogs, but can also have issues with interdog aggression and intolerance to strangers. Their original purpose of hunting hogs, controlling cattle, etc has bred in a high prey drive; small animals including cats and chickens may be injured by a Catahoula, even when raised with them.  Some do not always make a good family dog, and are better suited to a working or active performance home. Aggression, destructive behavior, and undesirable behaviors all begin when inadequate mental and physical exercise is provided. Most Catahoulas are good with children, and will protect them against aggressors, (though some are prone to mistake aggression for other emotions). Most are also good with unknown children and their contact with the dog's \"pack\"/family, but they are wary of unknown adults. Socialization and training from a young age may help lessen some undesirable behaviors, but may not completely eliminate them.  They will alert one to anything out of the ordinary. \nSometime you will have to remind them that you are the alpha, because they are incredibly smart dogs, and it might go to their heads. With this intelligence, from an old age they can still learn new tricks and behavior faster than the average dog. The majority of Catahoulas are even tempered.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\n\n=== Hunting ===\nThese dogs are outstanding bay dogs, or tracking and hunting dogs. They have been known to track animals from miles away, and have been used for hunting feral pigs, squirrel, deer, raccoon, mountain lion, and black bear. They often track silently and only begin to make their distinctive baying bark, eye to eye with the prey, once it is stopped, and hold it in position without touching the animal; using only posture, eye contact, and lateral shifts.\nCatahoulas have been introduced in the Northern Territory of Australia where they have been found to be a superior hunting dog for pigs by breeders. They have been introduced in New Zealand as well as Australia, but the number of Catahoulas there is unclear.\n\n\n=== Herding ===\nThey are used primarily for herding cattle, and pigs by a method of antagonizing and intimidation of herd animals as opposed to the method of all-day boundary patrol and restricting the animals being herded from entering or leaving the designated area. They are good with reindeer. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Catahoulas exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in cow/hog dog trials.The breed is recognized by the United Kennel Club  and the American Kennel Club under the \"herding dog\" breed group.\n\n\n== Health issues ==\n\n\n=== Deafness ===\nDeafness is one of the major genetic traits in Catahoulas and associated with individuals that are excessively white in color and deafness attributed to a lack of melanocytes. A Catahoula that is predominantly white has an 80% chance of being bi-laterally deaf or uni-laterally hearing. Hearing in one ear is referred to as \"directional deafness\". Breeders are often unwilling to allow deaf Catahoulas to leave their premises and will generally euthanize deaf pups.\nPuppies born from a litter where both parents have the \"Merle\" color pattern have a 25% chance of being born blind, deaf or blind and deaf. These puppies are often referred to as \"Double Merles\". A double merle can come from any breed, or breed mix. As long as both parents are merle, each puppy has a chance of being born with these traits.\n\n\n=== Hip dysplasia ===\nA concern with many breeds, hip dysplasia is dependent on the gene pool and good breeders. The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals and PennHIP can help determine whether a specific individual is prone to hip dysplasia through radiographs. According the OFA - roughly 20% (or 1 in 5) Catahoulas have Hip dysplasia.\n\n\n== Catahoula lines ==\nThere are three lines:\n\nThe Wright line: The Wright Line was the largest line of Catahoulas at 90 to 110 pounds (40 to 50 kg) and was developed by Mr. Preston Wright. This line represented dogs originally produced from Hernando de Soto's dogs.\nThe Fairbanks line: The Fairbanks line was the next in size at 65 to 75 pounds (30 to 35 kg) and were developed by Mr. Lovie Fairbanks. They were brindle to yellow in color.\nThe McMillin line: The McMillin line was known to be Blue Catahoulas with glass eyes the smallest in size at 50 to 60 pounds (about 25 kg) and were developed by Mr. T. A. McMillin of Sandy Lake, Louisiana. These were Blue Catahoula dogs with glass eyes.These three lines were crossed back and forth and created the variations of Catahoulas seen today.\n\n\n== Notable references to Catahoulas in history ==\nDuring the early 1900s, Theodore Roosevelt used the Catahoula when hunting.\nJim Bowie and his brother Rezin Bowie, who spent much of their youth in Catahoula Parish are reported to have owned a pair of Catahoulas. They were said to sleep with a Catahoula at their feet.\nLouisiana Governor Earl K. Long had an interest in the breed and collected them. This interest was recognized by an annual competition known as Uncle Earl's Hog Dog Trials.\nIn 2007, the Catahoula was voted to be the school mascot for Centenary College of Louisiana.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Catahoula Leopard Dog at Wikimedia Commons"}, {"id": 128, "name": "Catalan Sheepdog", "country": "Spain", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog128", "description": "The  Catalan sheepdog (Catalan: Gos d'atura catal\u00e0, Spanish: Pastor catal\u00e1n) is a breed of Catalan Pyrenean dog used as a sheepdog. This dog is bred in Europe, especially in Spain, Finland, Germany, and Sweden.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nCatalan sheepdogs range in size from 17 to 19 in (45 to 55 cm) in height and 45 to 60 lb (20 to 27 kg) in weight for males, with females being smaller. Their coat is long and either flat or slightly wavy, and ranges from fawn to dark sable and light to dark grey. There is also a short-haired variety of this breed, but it is nearly extinct.\n\n\n=== Size and weight ===\nHeight at withers: 47\u221255 cm and 20\u221225 kg for male dogs; from 45\u221253 cm and 17\u201321 kg for females.\n\n\n=== Hair and hair color ===\nLong and limp and a little curled.\nSeen from afar the dog seems to be unicolour and may have lighter shadings at the limbs. When seen close up, it is noticeable that the colour comes from a mixture of hairs of different colour shades: fawn, brown more or less reddish, grey and black.\nLong, flat, or very slightly wavy, rough with abundant undercoat on the whole posterior third of the body. On the head a beard, moustaches, tuft and eyebrows which do not affect sight can be noticed. Tail well covered with hair as are all four limbs. It is noticeable that during moulting a typical phenomenon may be observed: it occurs in two periods. First of all it affects the coat on the front part, giving the impression of two halves with different coats; then moults the hind part of the dog and everything becomes uniform again.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThis breed is used for herding and as a pet dog. Because of its intelligence, the Gos D'Atura, like most sheepdogs, is easy to train. This cheerful dog excels at dog-sports, such as agility and doggy-dance. In spite of its appearance, this courageous dog is also used as a watch-dog. An \"all-around-dog\" and great companion.\nThey guard sheep without needing instruction. Enough (outdoor) activity and distraction makes this dog a quiet and well-balanced home companion.  This breed is appropriate for people with firm techniques and who can give the dog enough exercise. Early socialization is important, particularly if the dog will be around children. The dogs defend their family and become attached to it.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe Gos d'Atura can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Catalan sheepdogs exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== Health ==\nCatalan sheepdogs are prone to hip dysplasia.

Plain dogs have a shorter coat and appear taller as they are more lightly built. Mountain dog types have a heavier coat and are more muscularly built. \nCaucasian ovcharka are large dogs. The minimum height for females is 64 centimetres (25 in), with a desirable height between 67 and 70 centimetres (26 and 28 in). The minimum weight for females is 45 kilograms (99 lb). The minimum height for males is 68 centimetres (27 in), with a desirable height between 72 and 75 centimetres (28 and 30 in). The minimum weight for males is 50 kilograms (110 lb).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Caucasus mountains are home to many of the oldest living molosser landrace dogs. During the 20th century the soviets selected one of the varieties among the caucasian dogs and created the modern Caucasian Shepherd Dog breed.Although its first official Show-Ring appearance outside the Caucasus was in the 1930s in Germany, the Caucasian Shepherd Dog (or its ascendents) has existed since ancient times. \nIn ancient times they served shepherds in the Caucasus mountains as livestock guardian dogs, defending sheep from predators, mainly wolves, jackals and bears. They also served as guard dogs, bear hunting dogs and today they work as prison guard dogs in Russia.The Caucasian Shepherd Dog is a fully standardized breed, recognized by major kennel organizations, including the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale and the United Kennel Club.The Caucasian Ovcharka Working Dog Club of America is seeking for fully American Kennel Club recognition.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Caucasian Shepherd Dog is an extremely independent, self-confident, fearless and intelligent dog. It is a highly protective dog averse to unfamiliar people.It is a low activity dog, seemingly lethargic when not working, but agile and convincing when it feels its family is threatened. Although certain strains are more vicious than others, they commonly are very territorial and dog-aggressive, needing early and careful broad socialization, as well as consistent, but never forceful, handling. This breed can be a family dog, if well trained and socialized.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Caucasian Shepherd Dog is generally healthy and long-lived, averaging a life span of 10\u201312 years. Some dogs may have health issues in the form of hip dysplasia, obesity and occasional heart problems, but the majority of these dogs are healthy if taken care of correctly. Good dog breeders use genetic testing of their breeding stock to reduce the chances of diseases in the puppies.\nThe ears of the Caucasian Shepherd Dog are traditionally cropped, although some modern dogs are unaltered, as many people believe that this practice is unethical and cruel. If brought up by someone with extensive knowledge on the needs of a Caucasian Shepherd Dog, the chances of health problems should lower dramatically.\nExercise and play time are a crucial part of the Caucasian Shepherd Dog's life to help prevent obesity. Outdoor activities such as hiking, chasing balls and retrieving flying discs can be a good outlet of releasing energy.\n\n\n== Training ==\nCaucasian Shepherd Dogs require very specific and detailed training. From the ages of 0\u20139 months the obedience of the dog has already been formed. It is recommended that an expert begins to train the dog from the ages of 7\u20138 months old. The training that is involved in this early stage should be light guidance on the teaching of obedience.Puppy school has been described as a bad option for the Caucasian Shepherd Dog. They do not tolerate other dogs very well and get out of control easily. This can be difficult to manage even if they are still young. After the early stages and training of a Caucasian Shepherd Dogs life, they can move on to learn about how to herd different types of livestock and defend them if the situation arises.It is important to expose the dog to extensive amounts of socialization to teach it that not all humans are enemies, starting this routine from a young age could be helpful. Caucasian Shepherd Dogs are not recommended to be adopted into families with young children because of their guardian instinct and powerful bodies.\n\n\n== Variants and co-existing Molosser breeds ==\nAstrakhan type is found in the Kabardino-Balkarian region and is believed to be a cross between the Russian show type and the old Balkarian and Georgian mountain dogs, but Balkarian Molossers are also rooted in the Sarmatian Mastiff.\nA variant of the Circassian sheepdog (also called shepherd or mountain dog) was also introduced to the Ottoman Empire after the Russo-Circassian wars. As a result of crossing Ottoman, Kangals with the Circassian mountain dog (not to be confused with the Circassian wolfhound), the mixed Cherkes dogs emerged.\nDagestan dogs are tall, wide-headed and athletic, short-haired and multi-colored.\nThe Armenian Gampr dog is a breed different from the Caucasian Shepherd Dog. In general, Armenian dogs are divided into the large, short-haired and often solid-colored type and the slightly smaller wolf-grey or multi-colored dogs of medium-length coat with longer muzzles.\nThe Georgian Shepherd is a related dog breed. It is muscular and athletic and is divided into two types: the short-haired Kazbegian dog, also known as \"Nagazi\", and the long-haired Georgian mountain dog. However, the Georgian Shepherd is not recognized as a standardized breed by any major kennel club.\nThe large, short-muzzled, shorthaired fawn, brown, red, with or without white markings and extremely vicious Garban (Gorban) was developed from the Kars and the Kangal, as well as other Turkish dogs,  being crossed with Armenian and Georgian dogs. The Georgian Akhaltsihnske type was created from Garban crosses with the Georgian Nagazi variant and gomik Turkey, resulting in longhaired, lightly built solid fawn, gray, and white dogs.\nA result of matings between the dogs of southern Kavkaz with Iranian Sarabi and Sage Mazandarani and the Kars Dog of Turkey, the impure Sage Ghafghazi is a lean, powerful and richly coated Mastiff, used as a caravan protector of the Shahsavan nomads who have been breeding it since the 17th century. These dogs come in a variety of colors, both solid and bicolored. A short-haired version of this dog with a very aggressive attitude towards anyone other than the caretaker is called a Sage Gorgy (Wolfdog). Its color is usually black or mixed with black and yellow. This dog is used for home protection, farm animal protection, and other efforts. This dog is often kept as a solitary dog because of its aggressive temper.\nThe Volkodav variant also comes in two types, with the longhaired mountain and short-coated steppe dogs, always having black masks.\nThere is also a rare short-haired Kavkaz Mastiff, known as the North-Caucasian Volkodav, which is on its way to receiving a separate breed recognition.\n\n\n== Aggression ==\nThe aggressive nature of the Caucasian Ovcharka makes it one of the most risky dog breeds to own for if not trained properly it will routinely snap at strangers or anyone they perceive as a threat.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSouth Russian Ovcharka\nMountain dog\nGeorgian Shepherd\nCentral Asian Shepherd Dog\nArmenian Gampr dog\nEast European Shepherd\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCaucasian Ovcharka Club of America\nCaucasian Shepherd Dog Club of America"}, {"id": 130, "name": "Cavalier King Charles Spaniel", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog130", "description": "The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a small spaniel classed as a toy dog by The Kennel Club and the American Kennel Club, that originated in the United Kingdom. Since 2000, it has grown in popularity in the United States and ranks as the 18th most popular pure-breed in the United States (2013 Registration Statistics).   It has a silky, smooth coat and commonly a smooth undocked tail. The breed standard recognises four colours: Blenheim (chestnut and white), Tricolour (black/white/tan), Black and Tan, and Ruby. The breed is generally friendly, affectionate and good with both children and other animals; however,  they require a lot of human interaction. Since they are a family dog, it is recommended to not leave them alone for long periods at a time. The expected average lifespan of a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is under ten years.The Cavalier King Charles changed dramatically in the late 17th century, when it was interbred with flat-nosed breeds. Until the 1920s, the Cavalier shared the same history as the smaller King Charles Spaniel. Breeders attempted to recreate what they considered to be the original configuration of the breed, a dog resembling Charles II's King Charles Spaniel of the Restoration. Various health issues affect this particular breed.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nDuring the early part of the 18th century, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, kept red and white King Charles type spaniels for hunting. The duke recorded that they were able to keep up with a trotting horse. His estate was named Blenheim in honour of his victory at the Battle of Blenheim. Because of this influence, the red and white variety of the King Charles Spaniel and thus the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel became known as the Blenheim.Attempts were made to recreate the original Cavalier King Charles Spaniel as early as the turn of the 20th century, using the now extinct Toy Trawler Spaniels. These attempts were documented by Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth, in the book \"Toy Dogs and Their Ancestors Including the History And Management of Toy Spaniels, Pekingese, Japanese and Pomeranians\" published under the name of the \"Hon. Mrs Neville Lytton\" in 1911.\n\n\n=== Divergence from King Charles Spaniel ===\nIn 1926, the American Roswell Eldridge offered a dog show class prize of twenty-five pounds each as a prize for the best male and females of \"Blenheim Spaniels of the old type, as shown in pictures of Charles II of England's time, long face, no stop, flat skull, not inclined to be domed, with spot in centre of skull.\" The breeders of the era were appalled, although several entered what they considered to be sub-par Cavalier King Charles Spaniels in the competition. Eldridge died before seeing his plan come to fruition, but several breeders believed in what he said and in 1928 the first Cavalier club was formed. The first standard was created, based on a dog named \"Ann's Son\" owned by Mostyn Walker, and the Kennel Club recognised the variety as \"King Charles Spaniels, Cavalier type\".The Second World War caused a drastic setback to the emerging breed, with the vast majority of breeding stock destroyed because of wartime hardship and food shortages. For instance, in the Ttiweh Cavalier Kennel, the population of sixty dogs dropped to three during the 1940s. Following the war, just six dogs would survive as the new beginning from which all present-day Cavaliers descend. These dogs were Ann's Son, his litter brother Wizbang Timothy, Carlo of Ttiweh, Duce of Braemore, Kobba of Kuranda and Aristide of Ttiweh. The numbers increased gradually, and in 1945 the Kennel Club first recognised the breed in its own right as the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.The history of the breed in America is relatively recent. The first recorded Cavalier living in the United States was brought from the United Kingdom in 1956 by W. Lyon Brown, together with Elizabeth Spalding and other enthusiasts, she founded the Cavalier King Charles Club USA which continues to the present day. In 1994, the American Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club was created by a group of breeders to apply for recognition by the American Kennel Club. The Cavalier would go on to be recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1995, and the ACKCSC became the parent club for Cavaliers.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nHistorically the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was a lap dog and is small for a spaniel, with fully grown adults comparable in size to adolescents of other larger spaniel breeds. Breed standards state that height of a Cavalier should be between 12 to 13 inches (30 to 33 cm) with a proportionate weight between 13 to 18 pounds (5.9 to 8.2 kg). The tail is usually not docked, and the Cavalier should have a silky coat of moderate length. Standards state that it should be free from curl, although a slight wave is allowed. Feathering can grow on their ears, feet, legs and tail in adulthood. Standards require this be kept long, with the feathering on the feet a particularly important aspect of the breed's features.The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the English Toy Spaniel can be often confused with each other. In the United Kingdom, the English Toy Spaniel is called the King Charles Spaniel while in the United States, one of the colours of the Toy Spaniel is known as King Charles. The two breeds share similar history and only diverged from each other about 100 years ago. There are several major differences between the two breeds, with the primary difference being the size. While the Cavalier weighs on average between 13 to 18 pounds (5.9 to 8.2 kg), the King Charles is smaller at 9 to 15 pounds (4.1 to 6.8 kg). In addition their facial features while similar, are different; the Cavalier's ears are set higher and its skull is flat while the King Charles's is domed. Finally the muzzle length of the Cavalier tends to be longer than that of its King Charles cousin.\n\n\n=== Colour ===\n\nThe breed has four recognized colours. Cavaliers which have rich chestnut markings on a pearly white background are known as Blenheim in honour of Blenheim Palace, where John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, raised the predecessors to the Cavalier breed in this particular colour. In some dogs there is a chestnut spot in the middle of the forehead: this is called the \"Blenheim\" spot. The Blenheim spot is also known as the mark of the \"Duchess Thumb Print\", based on the legend that Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough while awaiting news of her husband's safe return from the Battle of Blenheim, pressed the head of an expecting dam with her thumb, resulting in five puppies bearing the lucky mark after news that the battle had been won. Black and Tan are dogs with black bodies with tan highlights, particularly eyebrows, cheeks, legs and beneath the tail. Black and Tan is referred to as \"King Charles\" in the King Charles Spaniel. Ruby Cavaliers should be entirely chestnut all over, although some can have some white in their coats which is considered a fault under American Kennel Club conformation show rules. The fourth colour is known as Tricolour, which is black and white with tan markings on cheeks, inside ears,  on eyebrows, inside legs, and on underside of tail. This colour is referred to as \"Prince Charles\" in the King Charles Spaniel.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Popularity ===\nAccording to statistics released by The Kennel Club, Cavaliers were the sixth most popular dog in the United Kingdom in 2007 with 11,422 registrations in a single year. Labrador Retrievers were the most popular with 45,079 registrations in that year. Their popularity is on the rise in America; in 1998 they were the 56th most popular breed but in both 2007 and 2008 they were the 25th most popular. They ranked higher in some individual US cities in the 2008 statistics, being eighth in both Nashville and Minneapolis-St.Paul, seventh in Boston, Atlanta and Washington D.C., and sixth in both New York City and San Francisco. The breed's popularity has continued to grow, ranking in 18th place in 2013.\nIn 2009, the Cavalier was the fourth most popular breed in Australia with 3,196 registrations behind only Labrador Retrievers, German Shepherd Dogs and Staffordshire Bull Terriers. In addition, there are also national breed clubs in Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe breed is highly affectionate, playful, extremely patient and eager to please.  As such, dogs of the breed are good with children and other dogs. Cavaliers are not shy about socialising with much larger dogs. They will adapt quickly to almost any environment, family, and location and suit city and country life. Their ability to bond with larger and smaller dogs makes them ideal in houses with more than one breed of dog as long as the other dog is trained. Cavaliers rank 44th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of average intelligence in working or obedience. Cavaliers are naturally curious and playful, but also enjoy simply cuddling up on a cushion or lap, making them excellent companion or lap dogs for medical patients and the elderly.Cavaliers are active and sporting. Cavaliers are successful in conformation shows, obedience and agility and they also make wonderful therapy dogs due to their sweet, gentle natures. The breed is adaptable in their need for exercise, happy with either sleeping on the couch or taking long walks.\n\nThey have an instinct to chase most things that move including vehicles on busy streets, and so most Cavaliers will never become \"street-wise\". As they tend to regard all strangers as friends, members of the breed will usually not make good guard dogs. Spaniels have a strong hunting instinct and may endanger birds and small animals. However, owners have reported that through training their Cavaliers live happily with a variety of small animals including hamsters and gerbils.The Cavalier's coat requires weekly brushing, but no trimming. However, some owners prefer to trim their Cavalier's long feathers and slippers which can become very dirty when walking or playing outside.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nCavaliers can notably be prone to mitral valve disease, which leads to heart failure. This appears in many Cavaliers at some point in their lives and is the most common cause of death. Some serious genetic health problems, including early-onset mitral valve disease (MVD), the potentially severely painful syringomyelia (SM), hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and certain vision and hearing disorders are health problems for this breed. As today's Cavaliers all descend from only six dogs, any inheritable disease present in at least one of the original founding dogs can be passed on to a significant proportion of future generations. This is known as the founder effect and is the likely cause of the prevalence of MVD in the breed. The health problems shared with this breed include mitral valve disease, luxating patella, and hereditary eye issues such as cataracts and retinal dysplasia.\nCavaliers are also affected by ear problems, a common health problem among spaniels of various types, and they can have such other general conditions as hip dysplasia, which are common across many types of dog breeds.\n\n\n=== Mitral valve disease ===\n\nNearly all Cavaliers eventually have mitral valve disease, with heart murmurs which may progressively worsen, leading to heart failure. This condition is polygenic (affected by multiple genes), and therefore all lines of Cavaliers worldwide are susceptible. It is the leading cause of death in the breed. A survey by The Kennel Club of the United Kingdom showed that 42.8% of Cavalier deaths are cardiac related. The next most common causes are cancer (12.3%) and old age (12.2%). The condition can begin to emerge at an early age and statistically may be expected to be present in more than half of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels by age 5. It is rare for a 10-year-old Cavalier not to have a heart murmur. While heart disease is common in dogs generally \u2013 one in 10 of all dogs will eventually have heart problems \u2013 mitral valve disease is generally (as in humans) a disease of old age. The \"hinge\" on the heart's mitral valve loosens and can gradually deteriorate, along with the valve's flaps, causing a heart murmur (as blood seeps through the valve between heartbeats) then congestive heart failure. The Cavalier is particularly susceptible to early-onset heart disease, which may be evident in dogs as young as one or two years of age.Veterinary geneticists and cardiologists have developed breeding guidelines to eliminate early-onset mitral valve disease in the breed, but it is unclear if a statistically significant number of breeders follow these guidelines. The chairperson of the UK CKCS Club said in 2009: \"There are many members who are still not prepared to health check their breeding stock, and of those who do, it would appear that many would not hesitate to breed from affected animals.\" The MVD breeding protocol recommends that parents should be at least 2.5 years old and heart clear, and their parents (i.e., the puppy's grandparents) should be heart clear until age 5.\n\n\n=== Syringomyelia ===\n\nSyringomyelia (SM) is a condition affecting the brain and spine, causing symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis. It is caused by a malformation, commonly known as Chiari Malformation, in the lower back of the skull which reduces the space available to the brain, compressing it and often forcing it out (herniating it) through the opening into the spinal cord. This blocks the flow of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) around the brain and spine and increases the fluid's pressure, creating turbulence which in turn is believed to create fluid pockets, or syrinxes (hence the term syringomyelia), in the spinal cord. Syringomyelia is rare in most breeds but has become widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, with international research samples in the past few years consistently showing over 90% of Cavaliers have the malformation, and that between 30\u201370% have syrinxes. However, most dogs with syrinxes are not symptomatic.  Although symptoms of syringomyelia can present at any age, they typically appear between six months and four years of age in 85% of symptomatic dogs, according to Clare Rusbridge, a research scientist. Symptoms include sensitivity around the head, neck, or shoulders, often indicated by a dog whimpering or frequently scratching at the area of his neck or shoulder.  Scratching is often unilateral \u2013 restricted to one side of the body.  Scratching motions are frequently performed without actually making physical contact with the body (\"air scratching\").  The scratching behavior appears involuntary and the dog frequently scratches while walking \u2013 without stopping \u2013 in a way that is very atypical of normal scratching (\"bunny hopping\").  Scratching typical of SM is usually worse when the dog is wearing a collar, is being walked on leash, or is excited, and first thing in the morning or at night.Not all dogs with SM show scratching behavior.  Not all dogs who show scratching behavior appear to be in pain, though several leading researchers, including Dr Clare Rusbridge in the UK and Drs Curtis Dewey and Dominic Marino in the US, believe scratching in SM cavaliers is a sign of pain and discomfort and of existing neurological damage to the dorsal horn region of the spine.  If onset is at an early age, a first sign may be scratching and/or rapidly appearing scoliosis.  If the problem is severe, there is likely to be poor proprioception (awareness of body position), especially with regard to the forelimbs.  Clumsiness and falling results from this problem. Progression is variable though the majority of dogs showing symptoms by age four tend to see progression of the condition.A veterinarian will rule out basic causes of scratching or discomfort such as ear mites, fleas, and allergies, and then, primary secretory otitis media (PSOM \u2013 glue ear), as well as spinal or limb injuries, before assuming that a Cavalier has SM.  PSOM can present similar symptoms but is much easier and cheaper to treat. Episodic Falling Syndrome can also present similar symptoms. An MRI scan is normally done to confirm diagnosis of SM (and also will reveal PSOM). If a veterinarian suspects SM he or she will recommend an MRI scan.  Neurologists give scanned dogs a signed certificate noting its grade.\n\n\n=== Episodic Falling (EF) ===\n\nEpisodic Falling causes \"exercise-induced paroxysmal hypertonicity\" meaning that there is increased muscle tone in the dog and the muscles cannot relax. Previously thought to be a muscular disorder, it is now known to be neurological. EF is caused by a single recessive gene, and a genetic test is available. Except for severe cases, episodes will be in response to exercise, excitement or similar exertions. Although EF is often misdiagnosed as epilepsy, which typically results in loss of consciousness, the dog remains conscious throughout the episode. Severity of symptoms can range from mild, occasional falling to freezing to seizure-like episodes lasting hours. Episodes can become more or less severe as the dog gets older and there is no standard pattern to the attacks. The onset of symptoms usually occurs when a dog is between 4 months and 4 years of age. It is similar to Scotty Cramp, a genetic disorder in Scottish Terriers. About 1% of Cavaliers are affected by the condition, with 19% being carriers. Dogs with whole coloured coats were more likely to be affected than dogs with parti-coloured coats.\n\n\n=== Thrombocytopenia and macrothrombocytopenia ===\nAs many as half of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels may have a congenital blood disorder called idiopathic asymptomatic thrombocytopenia, an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood, according to recent studies in Denmark and the United States. Platelets, or thrombocytes, are disk-shaped blood elements which aid in blood clotting. Excessively low numbers are the most common cause of bleeding disorders in dogs. The platelets in the blood of many Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are a combination of those of normal size for dogs and others that are abnormally oversized, or macrothrombocytes. Macrothrombocytosis also is a congenital abnormality found in at least a third of CKCSs. These large platelets function normally, and the typical Cavalier does not appear to experience any health problems due to either the size or fewer numbers of its platelets.\n\n\n=== Hip and knee disorders ===\nHip dysplasia is a common genetic disease that affects Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. It is not present at birth but develops with age. Hip dysplasia is diagnosed by X-rays, but it is not usually evident in X-rays of Cavaliers until they mature. Even in adult spaniels with severe hip dysplasia, X-rays may not always indicate the disease. In a series of evaluations by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the Cavalier was ranked 78th worst out of 157 breeds. The worst affected breeds were the Bulldog, Pug and Dogue de Bordeaux.Cavaliers can be subject to a genetic defect of the femur and knee called luxating patella. This condition is most often observed when a puppy is 4 to 6 months old. In the most serious cases, surgery may be indicated. The grading system for the patella runs from 1 (a tight knee), to 4 (a knee so loose that its cap is easily displaced). If a cavalier has a grade 1\u20132, physical rehabilitation therapy and exercise may reduce the grading and potentially avoid surgery. The grades 3\u20134 are most severe where surgery will most likely be needed to correct the problem to avoid the development of arthritis and lameness in the limb.\n\n\n=== Eye problems ===\nA disorder commonly found in Cavaliers is keratoconjunctivitis sicca, colloquially known as \"dry eye\". The usual cause of this condition is an autoimmune reaction against the dog's lacrimal gland (tear gland), reducing the production of tears. According to the Canine Inherited Disorders Database, the condition requires continual treatment and if untreated may result in partial or total blindness. This disorder can decrease or heal over time.A 1999 study of Cavaliers conducted by the Canine Eye Registration Foundation showed that an average of 30% of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels evaluated had eye problems. They include hereditary cataracts, corneal dystrophy, distichiasis, entropion, microphthalmia, progressive retinal atrophy, and retinal dysplasia.\n\n\n=== Ear disorders ===\nPrimary Secretory Otitis Media (PSOM), also known as glue ear, consists of a highly viscous mucus plug which fills the dog's middle ear and may cause the tympanic membrane to bulge. PSOM has been reported almost exclusively in Cavaliers, and it may affect over half of them. Because the pain and other sensations in the head and neck areas, resulting from PSOM, are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia (SM), some examining veterinarians have mis-diagnosed SM in Cavaliers which actually have PSOM and not SM.Cavalier King Charles Spaniels may be predisposed to a form of congenital deafness, which is present at birth, due to a lack of formation or early degeneration of receptors in the inner ear, although this is relatively rare.  In addition, more recent studies have found Cavaliers that develop a progressive hearing loss, which usually begins during puppyhood and progresses until the dog is completely deaf, usually between the ages of three and five years.  The progressive nature of this form of deafness in Cavaliers is believed to be caused by degeneration of the hearing nerve rather than the lack of formation or early degeneration of the inner ear receptors.\n\n\n== Urban legend ==\nAn urban legend claims that Charles II issued a special decree granting King Charles Spaniels permission to enter any establishment in the UK, overriding \"no dog except guide dogs\" rules.  A variant of this myth relates specifically to the Houses of Parliament. This myth is sometimes instead applied to the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.The UK Parliament website states: \"Contrary to popular rumour, there is no Act of Parliament referring to King Charles spaniels being allowed anywhere in the Palace of Westminster. We are often asked this question and have thoroughly researched it.\" Similarly, there is no proof of any such law covering the wider UK.  A spokesman for the Kennel Club said: \"This law has been quoted from time to time. It is alleged in books that King Charles made this decree but our research hasn't tracked it down.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nCompanion dog\nCompanion Dog Group\nToy Group\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCavalier King Charles Spaniel at Curlie"}, {"id": 131, "name": "Central Asian Shepherd Dog", "country": "Russia", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog131", "description": "The Central Asian Shepherd Dog is an ancient breed of dog from the regions of Central Asia. Traditionally, the breed was used for guarding sheep and goat herds, as well as to protect and for guard duty.\nIt is a large breed of dog recognized by FCI as a Molossoid type dog breed of Soviet-era origin under Russian patronage. Numerous breed representatives reside in Russia, and local kennel club officials refer to Central Asians as one of the most popular dog breeds in the country, rating them as the #1 breed in the country around 2000.\n\n\n== History ==\nCentral Asians most likely originated more than four thousand years ago from natural selection in a geographical area between the Ural, Caspian Sea, Asia Minor, and the Northwest border of China. Aboriginal Central Asians as well as mixes still can be found in its countries of origin, such as Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and surrounding countries. Some serve as livestock guardians, some protect their owners, and some are used for dog fighting, which is a national tradition in many countries of that region. This breed bears a strong genetic similarity to other aboriginal breeds of Livestock Guardian dogs from that region such as Caucasian Shepherd (Nagazi), Kangal dog, and Akbash.\n\nRussian biologists and scientists have studied the local dog population since the 18th century. After the Communist revolution, the Soviet government focused on working dog breeds for the Red Army, and imported the best breed representatives to Russia as per military dogs' and guard dogs' requirements.  Over the decades, this practice harmed the local population. The introduction of new breeds to the region led to crossbreeding. Eventually, purebred dogs only remained with herders, breed enthusiasts and farms, with a surfeit of crosses elsewhere. However, the Central Asian Shepherd Dog population is still stable in general, reproducing some true quality dogs praised for working abilities, regardless of country of origin. Trading bloodlines and purchasing unrelated breeding stock between Russia, other \"former USSR republics\"  (such as Ukraine, Belarus etc. ) and countries where CAO (Central Asian Ovtcharka) still at aboriginal stage is a common practice nowadays.\t\t\nThis breed comprises numerous breed types. They differ in size, color, head types, and hair types. Central Asians tend to form a social group, consisting of different members bearing different duties; thus puppies with different working qualities are normally born in the same litter. These breed features, as well as different traditional names for the breed, give grounds for complications with breed standard. Most important, purebred Central Asians have unique breed characteristics. Breed-specific dog anatomy includes exclusive features, such as very noticeable extremely flexible joints, false ribs, specific head set, and very strong neck with massive dewlap. Expressive, almost human eyes, revealing inimitable intelligence, finish the portrait.\n\nFor working qualities, modern Central Asians have been bred into different directions, depending on the demand for specific abilities. Traditional dog fights had always been a national tradition in places of original habitat, but they had never been cruel and destructive as pitbull-type fights. All herders from the same area annually met together, and fought their strongest sheep guardian male dogs to pick the winner. It was about dominance rather than destroying their own kind. Most dogs evaluated each other when met at the field and the weaker or more submissive dog left, taking the loss. Dogs seldom injured each other, inflicting mostly minor scratches within a short period of time. Only true leaders actually had to determine the strongest dog via a real fight; but this was minor, compared to their everyday duties, facing predators and venomous snakes.Modern commercial dog fights often differ from traditional as much as livestock guardian dogs differ from fighting dogs. There are different rules, and different breeds involved. Most Central Asians used for modern commercial fights come from fighting lines. The majority of breeders are aware of their dogs\u2019 backgrounds, and will tell whether the dog comes from lines used for fighting. One can always expect a high level of aggression toward other dogs from CAOs with a dog fighting background. It is always important to distinguish whether a dog will display aggression only toward strange, unfriendly dogs entering their territory, while establishing and maintaining the usual social relationships with other animals on the premises; or will attack regardless of whether the other dog is a member of the same social group. Promiscuity in aggression toward strangers and friends is highly atypical for the breed.\n\nCentral Asians are still in demand as livestock guardians, though not nearly as much as they used to be. These dogs, to differing degrees, are protective against human intruders; they are very territorial, safe with children; they love and respect elderly people, protect all small animals from predators, and are very gentle with family members.Dogs for personal protection or working dogs originated from livestock guardian dogs, selectively bred by Russian breed experts for working abilities. As a result, they excel in obedience, territory protection, and personal protection, and are very intelligent. As such, they make perfect house dogs. They do not need any complicated training to learn basic house rules, and treat the owner with the same great respect with which their ancestors treated the herder. These dogs were introduced to the worldwide sheep breeding community with great success. Guard dogs must be able to work as a team to protect sheep against predators; thus excessively aggressive CAOs, as with any other dogs, cannot be members of the pack, and will not pass this simple test for compliance with the breed origination purpose.\nCentral Asian Shepherd dogs can come from working lines, fighting lines, and livestock guardian lines, and behave accordingly, regardless of the country they come from. Simple pedigree research and conversation with the breeder will reveal what basic instincts one can expect from the dog. Central Asians from pure show lines are very rare, because most registries require working tests prior to breeding.Selected for centuries for their abilities to destroy predators, and praised for their power and stamina, Central Asians sometimes are called \"Volkodav\", \"The Wolf Crusher\" in Russian. It is very important to select only stable dogs for breeding purposes, and avoid starting protection training of dogs of this breed at early age.\n\n\n== General appearance ==\nThis breed presents a robust dog of greater than average size with great strength and power. They are independent, curious and alert, yet imperturbable. The dog is as long as it is tall at the withers, or slightly longer than its height. The hair is short or moderately long with a heavy undercoat. Its ears are, in practice, cropped very short, and the tail is docked moderately long (except for dogs from countries where cosmetic surgeries for dogs are illegal). Most common colors are black/white; fawn of different shades, from almost white to deep red; brindle. Some have a black mask.\nThe head is very solid, without pronounced stop or sculls. The neck is low set, short, with dewlap. The body is fairly broad, proportionate, muscles rather flat. The ribcage appears very long because of developed false ribs. The legs are straight, with heavy boning and moderate yet defined angulation. Leg bones must be in proportion, and shall never give the impression that any bone is short. The rump is broad. The typical gait is a gallop; however CAO can trot for hours without wearing themselves out.\n\n\n== Exercise ==\nThe large Central Asian Shepherd Dog may spend a considerable amount of time moving around in its native lands, and this kind of slow but steady exercise is what it likes best. With a job to do and a piece of property to protect, it will find the highest spot and keep an eye on all that happens.\n\n\n== Grooming ==\nNeither the longhaired nor shorthaired coat require a lot of grooming, but the thick undercoat results in heavy seasonal shedding twice a year.\n\n\n== Working requirements and tests ==\nThe Central Asian is a working breed of dog, and different breed fanciers organizations issue sets or rules and recommendations important to preserve dogs\u2019 abilities to perform certain duties. This includes special tests to determine a dog\u2019s inborn qualities, and training degrees or titles aimed to show what the dog can learn to do.\nThe National Breed Club in Russia developed a temperament test to  reveal a dog\u2019s willingness and ability to protect the premises, as well as titles in Obedience (such as OKD), and in Protection (such as ZKS or KS) for dogs in most pedigrees from Russia and other countries of that region. There are several other types of tests and training titles, from simple to extremely complicated.\nBreed Clubs in European countries seldom have requirements, while common dog sports such as  Schutzhund or IPO are not perfectly suitable for a Livestock Guardian dog. Some European Union Countries developed special tests for large breeds of dogs aiming to reveal a dog\u2019s overall stability, such as The Mentality Assessment test in Sweden.\nFight tests are common in countries where the breed is still in aboriginal stage, or in the process of formation. Despite adverse reputation of commercial dog fights, fight tests are aimed to reveal a dog\u2019s willingness and ability to fight predators. In countries with highly developed open field sheepherding, major livestock herd losses may be caused by predation from feral dogs and wolf-dog hybrids, and the livestock guardian dogs must be able to protect the sheep from those. The fight tests were established to maintain this important breed trait.\nAnd, finally, the real life test for the Central Asian is simply to be a farm dog, or herd protection dog, in any country. Information on Livestock Guardian dogs behavior and specifics can be found at Livestock Guardian Dog Association.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nThe CAO is a versatile, universal breed, and fits under different descriptions at a time, what is a reason for different Kennel Clubs to classify Central Asians under different dog breed groups. RKF, FCI recognized Russian Kennel Club, classified Central Asians as a working dog breed, reflecting tremendous results in obedience, protection and military-related training.  Modern breeding requirements by leading Kennel Club in Russia include mandatory temperament test and training title, besides show rating. UKC fit them together with other Flock Guardians of similar breeds, matching breed\u2019 natural sheep guarding abilities, proven by breeders and farmers in USA. FCI classified them as Molossoid dogs, sometimes described in different languages as Moloss or Molosser type dogs, likewise, reflecting the match by confirmation and common ancestry between CAO and related breeds.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPictures and video\nProtection work in Moscow, Russia.\nAboriginal Tajik Shepherd Dogs\nCentral Asians in their natural environment in country of origin"}, {"id": 132, "name": "Cesky Fousek", "country": "Czech Republic", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog132", "description": "The \u010cesk\u00fd Fousek is a Czech breed of versatile gun dog.

'Bohemian Terrier' or 'Czech Terrier') is a small terrier type dog originating in  Czechoslovakia.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Cesky Terrier was created by a Czech breeder, Franti\u0161ek Hor\u00e1k, in 1948, as a cross between a Sealyham Terrier and a Scottish Terrier, to create a terrier suitable for hunting in the forests of Bohemia. Although not a trained scientist, Hor\u00e1k worked for many years as a research assistant at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and used knowledge gained there in his dog breeding. Czechoslovakia was ruled by a communist regime at the time; when Hor\u00e1k's dogs became more popular around the world, he began to receive a large volume of mail from outside the country, which earned him the attention of the secret police. Hor\u00e1k died in 1997.\nThe Cesky Terrier was recognized for international competition by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1963 as breed number 246 in Group 3, Terriers. The breed is now recognized by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world. The Cesky Terrier is one of the six most rare dog breeds worldwide.The breed was first imported into the USA in the 1980s by a group of enthusiasts. They formed the Cesky Terrier Club of America in January 1988. As interest grew, the breed became eligible to join the American Kennel Club (AKC) Foundation Stock Service Program from January 1, 2004 allowing it to compete in AKC Earthdog tests. At this stage the American Cesky Terrier Fanciers Association was formed and recognised by the AKC. It is the club accepted as the parent club by the AKC. However, the Cesky Terrier Club of America remains active in promoting the breed in the USA.\nFrom mid-2011, the Cesky Terrier was able to compete in the terrier group in America as it was accepted for entry in the AKC Stud Book.The breed first arrived in the UK in 1989 and had to compete from the imported register. The Cesky Terrier was recognised by the Kennel Club (UK) in 1990 and on January 1, 2000 it gained rare breed status. It has since competed successfully in show competition in the UK.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Cesky Terrier is a well-muscled, short legged, well-pigmented, hunting terrier of a rectangular format. The Cesky has natural drop ears, a natural tail, and sports a long, silky with slight texture coat in shades of gray from charcoal to platinum (black pigmented) or rarely brown (liver pigmented). The Cesky is longer than it is tall and has a topline that rises slightly to the rear.\n\n\n== Size, Proportion Substance ==\nThe FCI Breed Standard gives the ideal measurements for the Cesky Terrier as:\n\nHeight \u2013 Height at withers Ideally 11.5 inches (290 mm) for a male and 10.5 inches (270 mm) for a female; no less than 9.5 inches (240 mm) and no more than 12.5 inches (320 mm).\nWeight \u2013 Weight is ideally between 13 and 22 pounds (5.9 and 10.0 kg).\nNo Cesky in good muscular condition and otherwise well balanced shall be penalized for being only Slightly outside the Ideal height or weight.\nLength \u2013 The length of body, measured from sternum to buttocks ideally between 16 and 17 inches (410 and 430 mm).

Not overdone with too much furnishings. Faults: Curly, Coarse or cotton-wool like texture. The Cesky Terrier is groomed by clipping and scissoring into a saddle pattern on the body, with the longer hair ending in a V on the tail. A \u201cU\u201d shape is cut out of the top lateral portion of the front legs and Areas of the neck, head, chest, shoulder, tail and rear thigh from the top of the V on the tail to the top of the hock and round the vent are clipped shorter to achieve this appearance and to highlight the well developed muscles of the Cesky Terrier. The Hair on the foreface from mid eye to the rear edge of the lip line is not to be clipped thus forming brows and a beard. The transition between clipped and unclipped areas should be pleasing to the eye and never abrupt.Color\n\nThe Cesky Terrier has two varieties of color: In mature dogs, 3 years or older: 1. Any shade of gray from charcoal to platinum gray with Black pigment. 2. Coffee Brown with Liver pigment. Black may appear on the head, beard, cheeks, ears, feet and tail. White, grey, brown and yellow markings are permitted on the head, beard, cheeks, neck, chest, limbs and around the vent. A white collar or white tip is permitted on the tail. The base color must always be predominant. Faults: Long brindled coat on dogs older than 2 years, white covering more than 20%, and a white blaze are disqualifying faults.Gait\n\nThe action should be free, driven and enduring. Gallop rather slow but lasting. The forelegs extend in a straight line forward.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe breed standard calls for a calm dog, and aggression is a disqualifying fault. Cesky Terriers are reputed to be less active and quieter than other terriers. This may or may not make them suitable pets for families with children.\n\n\n== Care ==\nThe coat of the Cesky Terrier is not stripped (dead hair pulled out with the fingers or a special knife) as in other terriers, but rather is clippered. The body and tail are clipped, and the furnishings (hair that hangs down under the body) are left long, as is the hair on the lower legs and on the face (eyebrows, beard,  and moustache.) The longer hair should be brushed daily.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\tHealth\tEdit\nThis breed occasionally suffers from the Scotty Cramp, a minor problem causing awkward movement, but it is not life-threatening.[citation needed]\nBreeding stock should be checked for hip dysplasia, patella luxation, cardiac problems, PLL (primary lens luxation) and other eye disorders such as cataracts, thyroid issues, degenerative myelopathy, and von willebrands type 3 , all of which have been documented issues in the breed.[citation needed]\n\n\n== See also ==\nTerrier\nTerrier Group\nWorking terrier\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCanada's Guide to Cesky Terrier"}, {"id": 134, "name": "Chesapeake Bay Retriever", "country": "United States", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog134", "description": "The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a large-sized breed of dog belonging to the Retriever, Gundog, and Sporting breed groups.  Members of the breed may also be referred to as a Chessie, CBR, or Chesapeake. The breed was developed in the United States Chesapeake Bay area during the 19th century. Historically used by area market hunters to retrieve waterfowl, it is primarily a family pet and hunting companion. They are often known for their love of water and their ability to hunt.  It is a medium to large sized dog similar in appearance to the Labrador Retriever. The Chesapeake has a wavy coat, rather than the Labrador's smooth coat. They are described as having a bright and happy disposition, courage, willingness to work, alertness, intelligence, and love of water as some of their characteristics.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nDistinctive features include eyes that are very clear, of yellowish or amber hue, hindquarters as high or a trifle higher than the shoulders, and a double-coat that tends to wave on shoulders, neck, back, and loins. The waterproof coat feels slightly oily and is often associated with a slight musky odor. Three basic colors are generally seen in the breed: brown, which includes all shades from a light to a deep dark brown; sedge, which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; and deadgrass in all its shades, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. The breed standard states that white may also appear but it must be limited to the breast, belly, toes, or back of the feet. The head is round and broad with a medium stop and muzzle. The lips are thin, and the ears are small and of medium leather. The forelegs should be straight with good bone. The hindquarters are especially strong and the toes webbed since excellent swimming ability is important for the Chesapeake. This breed is also known for its large and powerful chest, used to break apart ice when diving into cold water while duck hunting.\n\n\n==== Coat ====\nThe coat of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever is given the most consideration of any trait listed on the Positive Scale of Points in the Breed Standard. However the AKC Standard also reads \"The question of coat and general type of balance takes precedence over any scoring table which could be drawn up. The Chesapeake should be well proportioned, an animal with a good coat and well balanced in other points being preferable to one excelling in some but weak in others.\" The hair on the face and legs should be very short and straight with a tendency to wave, never curl, on the shoulders, neck, back, and loins only and nowhere over 1.5 inches long. Moderate feathering on the rear of the hindquarters and tail is permissible although not longer than 1.75 inches long.\nThe texture of the thick double-coat is important in protecting the dog from cold water and icy conditions. The oil in the harsh outer coat and woolly undercoat resists water, keeping the dog dry and warm. Maintenance of the coat is minimal and mainly consists of brushing with a short-tooth brush once a week. It is difficult to get a Chesapeake Bay Retriever thoroughly wet, but they should be bathed every 3\u20134 months using a suitably mild shampoo, then dried thoroughly. Brushing or bathing more often can ruin the texture since it strips the protective oil from the coat and may even remove the undercoat.  The color of the coat must be similar to the working surroundings. Any color of brown, sedge or deadgrass is acceptable and one color is not preferred over another. The American Chesapeake Club includes a discussion on color:\n\nThree basic colors are generally seen in the breed: Brown which includes all shades from a light cocoa (a silvered brown) to a deep bittersweet chocolate color; sedge which varies from a reddish yellow through a bright red to chestnut shades; deadgrass which takes in all shades of deadgrass, varying from a faded tan to a dull straw color. Historic records show that some of the deadgrass shades can be very light, almost white in appearance, while darker deadgrass colors can include diluted shades of brown called ash, that appear as either gray or taupe. The almost white and ash/taupe/gray shades are not commonly seen, but are acceptable.The difference between a sedge and a deadgrass is that the deadgrass shades contain no significant amount of red, while the sedge shades do have red. Coat and texture also play a factor in the perception of color. The self-color pattern is preferred by the standard (One color with or without lighter and darker shadings of the same color). You will see dogs with varying degrees of other markings such as: masking on top of the skull, striping effect of light & dark through the body and on legs, distinct & indistinct saddle markings, agouti coloring and tan points. All are acceptable, they are just not preferred.A white spot on the breast (not extending above the sternum), belly, toes or back of the feet is permissible, but the smaller the spot the better. White beyond these areas and black anywhere on the body is not allowed in the breed standard.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe quintessential Chesapeake Bay Retriever has a bright and happy disposition, intelligence, quiet good sense, and an affectionate protective nature. Some can be quite vocal when happy, and some will 'smile' by baring their front teeth in a peculiar grin - this is not a threat but a sign of joy or submissiveness.\nChesapeake Bay Retrievers can make excellent family dogs when socialized properly. Some Chesapeakes are assertive and willful and may be reserved with strangers, but others are passive and outgoing with people.\n\n\n==== Training ====\nThe Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a versatile breed competing in field trials, hunt tests, conformation, obedience, agility and tracking, yet remains true to its roots as a hunting dog of great stamina and ability. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is an intelligent breed and learns at a high speed. Historically considered stubborn and difficult to train, many trainers thought this breed required more physical discipline than other retriever breeds. Some trainers now recommend that the Chesapeake Bay Retriever owner use consistent, daily obedience training with play time before and after to keep the dog wanting to work with little or no physical discipline required.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe breed is subject to a number of hereditary diseases. These include, but are not limited to:\n\nHip dysplasia\nProgressive retinal atrophy\nType 3 von Willebrand disease\nCataract\nRegional Alopecia in both sexesA UK Kennel Club survey puts the median lifespan of the breed at 10.75 years (average 9.85). A US breed club survey puts the average lifespan at 9.4 years. 1 in 4 lived to 13 years or more while 1 in 5 don't live past 5 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nChesapeake Bay Retrievers trace their history to two pups who were rescued from a foundering ship in Maryland in 1807. The male \"Sailor\" and female \"Canton\" were described as  Newfoundland dogs, but were more accurately Lesser Newfoundland or St. John's water dogs. These two lived in different parts of the bay area and there is no record of a litter being produced together. They were bred with area dogs, with more consideration given to ability than to breed, to create the beginnings of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever breed. There are few records of the breeds of these early dogs, but spaniels and hounds were included. Dogs from both Chesapeake Bay shores were recognized as one of three types of Chesapeake Bay Ducking Dog in 1877. In 1918 a single type, called the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, was recognized by the American Kennel Club, and there have been few changes to the breed standard since then.\nGeorge Law, who rescued the pups, wrote this account in 1845 which appears on the website of the American Chesapeake Bay Retriever Club:\n\nIn the fall of 1807 I was on board of the ship Canton, belonging to my uncle, the late Hugh Thompson, of Baltimore, when we fell in, at sea, near the termination of a very heavy equinoctial gale, with an English brig in a sinking condition, and took off the crew. The brig was loaded with codfish, and was bound to Pole, in England, from Newfoundland. I boarded her, in command of a boat from the Canton, which was sent to take off the English crew, the brig's own boats having been all swept away, and her crew in a state of intoxication. I found onboard of her two Newfoundland pups, male and female, which I saved, and subsequently, on our landing the English crew at Norfolk, our own destination being Baltimore, I purchased these two pups of the English captain for a guinea apiece. Being bound again to sea, I gave the dog pup, which was called Sailor, to Mr. John Mercer, of West River; and the slut pup, which was called Canton, to Doctor James Stewart, of Sparrow's Point. The history which the English captain gave me of these pups was, that the owner of his brig was extensively engaged in the Newfoundland trade, and had directed his correspondent to select and send him a pair of pups of the most approved Newfoundland breed, but of different families, and that the pair I purchased of him were selected under this order. The dog was of a dingy red colour; and the slut black. They were not large; their hair was short, but very thick-coated; they had dew claws. Both attained great reputation as water-dogs. They were most sagacious in every thing, particularly so in all duties connected with duck-shooting. Governor Lloyd exchanged a Merino ram for the dog, at the time of the Merino fever, when such rams were selling for many hundred dollars, and took him over to his estate on the eastern shore of Maryland, where his progeny were well known for many years after; and may still be known there, and on the western shore, as the Sailor breed. The slut remained at Sparrows Point till her death, and her progeny were and are still well known, through Patapsco Neck, on the Gunpowder, and up the bay, amongst the duck-shooters, as unsurpassed for their purposes. I have heard both Doctor Stewart and Mr. Mercer relate most extraordinary instances of the sagacity and performance of both dog and slut, and would refer you to their friends for such particulars as I am unable, at this distance of time, to recollect with sufficient accuracy to repeat.Mercer is said to have described Sailor:\n\n... he was of fine size and figure-lofty in his carriage, and built for strength and activity; remarkably muscular and broad across the hips and breast; head large, but not out of proportion; muzzle rather longer than is common with that race of dogs; his colour a dingy red, with some white on the face and breast; his coat short and smooth, but uncommonly thick, and more like a coarse fur than hair; tail full, with long hair, and always carried very high. His eyes were very peculiar: they were so light as to have almost an unnatural appearance, something resembling what is termed a wail eye, in a horse; and it is remarkable, that in a visit which I made to the Eastern Shore, nearly twenty years after he was sent there, in a sloop which had been sent expressly for him, to West River, by Governor Lloyd, I saw many of his descendants who were marked with this peculiarity.In 1964, it was declared the official dog of Maryland.It is the mascot of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.\nMembers of the breed were owned by General George Armstrong Custer, President Theodore Roosevelt, Senator John McCain, and actors Paul Walker and Tom Felton.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChesapeake Bay Retriever at Curlie\nPedigree Databases\nThe Chesapeake Bay Retriever Pedigree Database\nChessieInfo Network - Health, Titling and Pedigree database"}, {"id": 135, "name": "Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Noir", "country": "France", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog135", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 136, "name": "Chien Fran\u00e7ais Blanc et Orange", "country": "France", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog136", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 137, "name": "Chien Fran\u00e7ais Tricolore", "country": "France", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog137", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 138, "name": "Chien-gris", "country": "France", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog138", "description": "The Chien-gris a.k.a. Gris de Saint-Louis (Grey St. Louis Hound) was a breed of dog, now extinct, which originated in Medieval times. Like the Chien de Saint-Hubert it was a scenthound, and formed part of the royal packs of France, which were composed, from about 1250 till 1470, exclusively of hounds of this type. According to King Charles IX, (1550\u20131574) they supposedly were introduced to France through Saint Louis (i.e. King Louis IX, 1226\u20131270), who had encountered these hounds while a prisoner during the Crusades, and subsequently received some as a gift. Old writers on hunting liked to ascribe an ancient and remote origin to their hounds, and these were claimed to be originally from Tartary. \nThey were large, and, even though they did not have such good noses, were preferred by the Kings to the St Huberts, which were said to be only of medium size.\nJacques du Fouilloux, in the 16th century, says they were common, and describes them as 'gris' (grey) on the back with forequarters and legs tan or red, some having near black hair on the back. They were roughhaired, and were ancestors of the  modern French rough-coated Griffon breeds. However the rough coats were not mentioned by Charles IX or du Fouilloux, and it has been suggested they were acquired later through interbreeding with indigenous French hounds.  They were headstrong, wide casting hounds, inclined to change or overshoot, but determined in their pursuit of a quarry to the death. However, by the nineteenth century, like the St Hubert, they had become virtually impossible to find, because of mixed breeding and the effect of the Revolution on French hunting.George Turberville   translated du Fouilloux' book on hunting into English, and used the term 'Dun hound' to translate 'Chien-gris'. We may presume he did not translate it literally as 'grey-hound' to avoid confusion. One finds the term 'dun-hound' in some subsequent writing in English, suggesting that the kind also existed in Britain, and it has been supposed that these 'dun-hounds' went into the make up of the Bloodhound, accounting for the 'badgering' of the hair in the saddles of some bloodhounds.  However, Turberville did not make it very clear that his book was a translation, and it is highly possible that people mistakenly believed his work was about English hunting. Early references to the dun-hound may simply come from people relying, like Nicolas Cox, on Turberville, [1] and it is quite possible that the dun hound was never a significant animal in British hunting.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 139, "name": "Chihuahua (dog)", "country": "Mexico", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog139", "description": "The Chihuahua  (listen) (Spanish: chihuahue\u00f1o) is the smallest breed of dog and is named after the state of Chihuahua in Mexico. Chihuahuas come in a wide variety of colors, and two coat lengths.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Chihuahua's history is convoluted, and  many theories surround the origin of the breed. Both folklore and archaeological finds show that the breed has origins in Mexico. The most common theory is that Chihuahua are descended from the Techichi, a companion dog favored by the Toltec civilization in Mexico. No records of the Techichi are available before the 9th century, although dog pots from Colima, Mexico, buried as part of the western Mexico shaft tomb tradition, which date back to 300 BC, are thought to depict Techichis. The earlier ancestors probably were present before the Mayas as dogs approximating the Chihuahua are found in materials from the Great Pyramid of Cholula, antedating 1530 and in the ruins of Chichen Itza on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. However, genetic evidence reveals very little pre-European genetics in modern chihuahuas (<2%), suggesting that interbreeding with European dogs has left little of the original American lineage (while possibly retaining a similar form).Wheeled dog toys in Mesoamerica range from Mexico to El Salvador. The earliest of these were found at Tres Zapotes in Veracruz, Mexico, which date to 100 AD, indirect evidence that a Chihuahua-like breed was in Mexico over 1400 years before the first Europeans arrived.Dog effigy pots dating to around 1325 AD discovered in Georgia and Tennessee also appear to represent the Chihuahua. In 1850, a pot featuring the Chihuahua-like dogs was unearthed in old ruins at Casas Grandes in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, which dates from 1100\u20131300 AD showing the long history of such dogs at this site, although most artifacts relating to its existence are found around Mexico City. It has been argued that these pots arrived with survivors from the Casas Grandes site in Chihuahua, Mexico, after it was attacked and destroyed around 1340 AD.\nIn a 1520 letter, Hernan Cort\u00e9s wrote that the Aztecs raised and sold the little dogs as food. Colonial records refer to small, nearly hairless dogs at the beginning of the 19th century, one of which claims 16th-century Conquistadores found them plentiful in the region later known as Chihuahua. Small dogs such as Chihuahuas were also used as living hot-water bottles during illness or injury. Some believe this practice is where the idea of pain being transferred to animals from humans originated, which gave way to rituals such as burning the deceased with live dogs, such as the Techichi, to exonerate the deceased human's sins. Chihuahuas as we know them today remained a rarity until the early 20th century; the American Kennel Club (AKC) did not register a Chihuahua until 1904.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nChihuahuas are the smallest breed recognized by some kennel clubs.There are two varieties of Chihuahua recognized by the AKC\u2013 the Smooth Coat (shorthaired) and the Long Coat (longhaired). Both the Smooth and the Long Coats have their special attractions and are equally easy to keep clean and well groomed. The UK Kennel Club considers the two as distinct breeds; matings between the two are not eligible for KC registration.\nDogs of either coat type may be identified as either \"apple head\" or \"deer head\" Chihuahuas, particularly in the United States. Apple heads have rounded heads, close-set eyes, and relatively short ears and legs. Deer heads have flat-topped heads, more widely set eyes, larger ears, and longer, more slender legs. While deer heads were popular in the mid-20th century, current breed standards defined by registries such as the AKC specify the apple-head conformation.\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nBreed standards for this dog do not generally specify a height; only a weight and a description of their overall proportions. Generally, the height ranges between 6 and 9 in (15 and 23 cm); however, some dogs grow as tall as 30 to 38 cm (12 to 15 in). Both British and American breed standards state that a Chihuahua must not weigh more than 5.9 lb (2.7 kg) for conformation.\nHowever, the British standard also states that a weight of 4\u20136 lb (1.8\u20132.7 kg) is preferred. A clause stating. \"if two dogs are equally good in type, the more diminutive one is preferred\" was removed in 2009. \nThe F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale  standard calls for dogs ideally between 1.5 and 3.0 kg (3.3 and 6.6 lb), although smaller ones are acceptable in the show ring.Pet Chihuahuas (that is, those bred or purchased as companions rather than show dogs) often range above these weights, even above 10 lb if they have large bone structures or are allowed to become overweight.\nThis does not mean that they are not purebred Chihuahuas; they just do not meet the requirements to enter a conformation show. Oversized Chihuahuas are seen in some of the best, and worst, bloodlines. Chihuahuas do not breed true for size, and puppies from the same litter can mature in drastically different sizes from one another. Also, larger breeding females are less likely to experience dystocia (obstructed labor). Typically, the breed standard for both the Long and Short Coat Chihuahuas will be identical except for the description of the coat. Chihuahuas have large, round eyes and large, erect ears, set in a high, dramatically rounded skull.The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom and the AKC in the United States recognize only two varieties of Chihuahua: the long coat, and the smooth coat, also referred to as longhaired and shorthaired. The term smooth coat does not mean that the hair is necessarily smooth, as the hair can range from having a velvet touch to a whiskery feeling. Longhaired Chihuahuas are actually smoother to the touch, having soft, fine guard hairs and a downy undercoat, which gives them their fluffy appearance. Unlike many longhaired breeds, longhaired Chihuahuas require no trimming and minimal grooming. Contrary to popular belief, the longhaired breed also typically sheds less than its shorthaired counterparts. Up to three or more years may be needed before a full longhaired coat develops.\nChihuahuas occur in virtually any color combination, from solid to marked or splashed, allowing for colors from solid black to solid white, spotted, sabled, or a variety of other colors and patterns. Colors and patterns can combine and affect each other, resulting in a very high degree of variation. Common colors are fawn, red, cream, chocolate, brown, mixed, white, and black. No color or pattern is considered more valuable than another.\nThe merle coat pattern, which appears mottled, is not traditionally considered part of the breed standard. In May 2007, The Kennel Club decided not to register puppies with this coloration due to the health risks associated with the responsible gene, and in December of that year, formally amended its breed standard to disqualify merle dogs. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, which represents the major kennel clubs of 84 countries, also disqualified merle. Other countries' kennel clubs, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Germany, have also disqualified merle. However, in May 2008, the Chihuahua Club of America voted that merles would not be disqualified in the United States, and would be fully registrable and able to compete in AKC events. Opponents of merle recognition suspect the coloration came about by modern crossbreeding with other dogs and not by natural genetic drift.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nHow a Chihuahua behaves depends on the genetic temperament of his or her parents and grandparents. However, as with all dogs, socialization and training are very important. Like many small dogs, Chihuahuas are less likely than large dogs to be given obedience classes, socialization, or appropriate exercise and training. Frequent victims of \"small dog syndrome\", in which owners feel no need to provide the kind of training and socialization routinely provided for larger dogs, untrained Chihuahuas suffer the same predictable behavior problems as other untrained dogs regardless of the breed. However, they thrive well when given appropriate socialization and training.Poorly socialized or frightened Chihuahuas can be easily provoked to attack, so are generally unsuitable for homes with small and undisciplined children. The breed tends to be fiercely loyal to one particular person and in some cases may become overprotective of the person, especially around other people or animals. They are frequently not introduced to or socialized with dogs of other breeds, and as a result do not interact as well with them, as other dogs that have been socialized to interact with different breed types and tend to have a \"clannish\" nature, often preferring the companionship of other Chihuahuas or Chihuahua mixes over other dogs. These traits generally make them unsuitable for households with children who are not patient and calm. If properly managed by older children, 13 and up, they can adapt to this kind of living with a dedicated owner. The temperament of its owner can make a difference in the temperament of the pup.Chihuahuas love their dens and often burrow themselves in pillows, clothes hampers, and blankets. They are often found under the covers or at the bottom of the bed, deep in the dark and safety of what they perceive as their den.  Chihuahuas also enjoy time in sunlight.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThis breed requires expert veterinary attention in areas such as birthing and dental care. Dental care is a must for these small dogs, whose jaw size makes for weaker teeth. Although daily brushing provides the best preventive measure, feeding a dental diet or using dental chews for dogs is an effective approach pet owners can take to help prevent and control accumulation of plaque and tartar to avoid consequences of severe periodontal disease. The best physical characteristics of dog food to contribute to cleaning a dog's teeth would be food that is large and dense, so more time is spent chewing, which leads to the surface of the teeth being cleaned.\nChihuahuas, and other toy breeds, can be affected by hydrocephalus. Chihuahua puppies with hydrocephalus have an abnormally large head, are lethargic, and do not grow at the same pace as their siblings. A true case of hydrocephalus can be diagnosed by a veterinarian, though the prognosis is grim.\nApple head Chihuahuas can have moleras, or a soft spot in their skulls, and they are the only breed of dog to be born with an incomplete skull. This is not a defect; it is a normal adaptation facilitating the passage through the birth canal and growth and development of the domed type of forehead. The molera is predominant in the apple heads and is present in nearly all Chihuahua puppies. The molera fills in with age, but great care needs to be taken during the first six months until the skull is fully formed. Some moleras do not close completely and require extra care to prevent injury.Chihuahua puppies can be at risk for hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Signs of hypoglycemia include lethargy, sleepiness, uncoordinated walking, unfocused eyes, spasms of the neck muscles or head pulling back or to the side, fainting, and seizures. Hypoglycemia can be avoided with adequate nutrition and frequent feedings, especially for Chihuahuas that are younger, smaller, or leaner. Chihuahua owners should have a simple-sugar supplement on hand to use in emergencies, such as Nutri-Cal or corn syrup. These supplements can be rubbed on the gums and roof of the mouth to rapidly raise the blood sugar level.\nHowever, as with any dog, owners should take care not to overfeed their Chihuahua, since obesity can result in increased rates of joint injuries, tracheal collapse, chronic bronchitis, and shortened lifespan.\nAs in other breeds with large, protruding eyes, Chihuahuas are prone to eye infections and eye injury. The eyes may water in response to dry air, dust, or airborne allergens.\nCollapsed trachea is a health concern characteristic of the Chihuahua breed.Chihuahuas may tremble or shiver when stressed, excited, or cold. These dogs, especially the short coat variety, are less tolerant of cold than larger breeds, and require a sweater/coat and/or boots in cold weather. They seek warmth in sunshine, under blankets, or on furniture, or human laps.\nSome Chihuahuas may present separation anxiety as a result of being so close and loyal to their owners. This is a fairly common cause behind any pacing, excessive salivating, destructive chewing, or barking, howling, or whining in dogs. Many treatments and tips can help prevent separation anxiety in dogs.\nThe lifespan for a Chihuahua is usually between 12 and 20 years.Chihuahuas are also known for luxating patella, a genetic condition that can occur in all dogs. In some dogs, the ridges forming the patellar groove are not shaped correctly and a shallow groove is created, causing the patella to luxate or slip out of place, sideways.

Quickly able to adapt to urban life, being used in new industries and new human settlements (CITES) for the extermination of rats. Because of this last factor is that Chileans terrier were identified for most of the last century with the working-class proletarian country element that played against those who were beginning to take the first steps to establish the activity in Chile, mostly immigrants and members of the bourgeoisie of the time, those more interested in the entry and development of foreign breeds in achieving recognition of the Chilean Terrier.\nDespite the near-zero interest local breeders of the time he appeared in the Chilean terrier continued to be present in the homes of the middle class of the country, further through the comic and his ever faithful Condorito Washington, Chilean terrier which demonstrates \u00abthe Chilean\u00bb of this little dog.\nToday the Chilean terrier is present throughout the country, it has the virtue of adapting to a variety of climates of Chile, still being used in rural areas as a hunter of mice and in the city, including an excellent dog company, attentive and lively.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIts main color is white, which is accompanied by black and brown markings.

Like most hairless dog breeds, the Chinese crested comes in two varieties, with and without fur, which are born in the same litter: the Powderpuff and the Hairless.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThis breed is considered small; 10\u201313 lb (4.5\u20135.9 kg).\nAt first look, the Hairless and Powderpuff varieties of Chinese crested dogs appear to be two different breeds, but hairlessness is an incomplete dominant trait within a single breed. The Hairless has soft, humanlike skin, as well as tufts of fur on its paws (\"socks\") and tail (\"plume\") and long, flowing hair on its head (\"crest\"). In addition to being an incomplete dominant gene, the \"hairless\" gene has a prenatal lethal effect when homozygous. Zygotes affected with double hairless genes (1 in 4) never develop into puppies, and are reabsorbed in the womb. All hairless Cresteds are therefore heterozygous.\nThe Hairless variety can vary in amount of body hair.  Fur on the muzzle, known as a beard, is not uncommon. A true Hairless often does not have as much furnishings (hair on the head, tail, and paws). The difference between a very hairy Hairless and a Powderpuff is that the Hairless has a single coat with hairless parts on the body, while the Powderpuff has a thick double coat.  The skin of the Hairless comes in a variety of colors, ranging from a pale flesh to black. Hairless Cresteds often lack a full set of premolar teeth, but this is not considered a fault.A Powderpuff has a long, soft coat. Both Hairless and Powderpuff varieties can appear in the same litter.  The look of the Powderpuff varies according to how it is groomed. When its fur is completely grown out on its face, it strongly resembles a terrier; however, the Powderpuff is usually shaved around the snout as a standard cut. The Powderpuff Chinese crested dog is an elegant and graceful dog who makes a loving companion, playful and entertaining. The Puff's coat is long and silky soft. Ears are large and erect.\nThe amount of body hair on the Hairless variety varies quite extensively, from the true hairless which has very little or no body hair and furnishings, to what is called a \"hairy hairless\", which, if left ungroomed, often grows a near-full coat of hair. These hairy hairless are not a mix between Powderpuffs and Hairless Chinese crested dogs, but are merely a result of a weaker expression of the variable Hairless gene.  The mutation responsible for the hairless trait was identified in 2008.\n\n\n== Care ==\n\nBoth varieties require certain amounts of grooming. The Powderpuff is entirely covered with a double, very soft, straight coat.  Although a Puff's coat does not continuously grow, it can grow to be quite long at full length.  A weekly bath & frequent brushing will help prevent matting. For an optimal coat, never brush when dry or dirty. A light spray of water, or grooming spray to their coat is recommended before brushing. Many choose to shave their Puff in a \"Pony Cut\" leaving long hair on bottom of legs, tail, head and crest for an easy care coat. Puffs are very clean and have no odor. This breed has \"little to no shedding\". (see Moult).\nMaintenance of the Hairless variety's skin is similar to maintaining human skin and as such it can be susceptible to acne, dryness, and sunburn. Hypoallergenic or oil-free moisturizing cream can keep the skin from becoming too dry when applied every other day or after bathing. Burning can occur in regions that are subject to strong UV radiation, especially in lighter-skinned dogs. Many owners apply baby sunscreen to their pets before spending time in strong sun. Some Cresteds have skin allergies to Lanolin, so be cautious when using any products that contain it.\n\nUnless the dog is a \"True\" Hairless (one with virtually no hair growth on non-extremities), trimming and/or shaving is often performed to remove excess hair growth.\nThe Chinese crested dog is further distinguished by its hare foot, (having more elongated toes) as opposed to the cat foot common to most other dogs. Because of this the quicks of Cresteds run deeper into their nails, so care must be taken not to trim the nails too short to avoid pain and bleeding.\nPowderpuffs enjoy getting outdoors for daily exercise, although they are not a high energy breed.  They are great for apartment or city living, but being very versatile, also love country living and long hikes.\nBeing a very intelligent breed, this dog does well in obedience type sports.  Consistency is a must, however this breed can be relatively sensitive and should have a gentle trainer.  The Powderpuff is great at learning and performing tricks.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThe Powderpuff is not affected by many of the congenital diseases found in other toy breeds. They are, however, prone to some of these conditions listed. Eye problems such as lens luxation, glaucoma, and PRA (Progressive Retinal Atrophy), luxating patellas, and Legg-Perthes disease. The Powderpuff should have full dentition, not missing or crooked teeth, as is accepted in their sibling the Hairless variety.\nCresteds have what is called a \"primitive mouth.\"  This means that most of their teeth are pointy, like their canines. Hairless varieties of the Cresteds can be prone to poor dentition. Poor dentition may include missing or crowded teeth and teeth prone to decay when not properly cared for. Most dogs of the Puff variety have few, if any, dental defects.\nEyes are a concern within the breed, with many suffering from a painful and blinding inherited eye disease called Primary Lens Luxation. (PLL) The Chinese Crested can also have at least two forms of progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) which can eventually lead to blindness as well. For PLL and also one of the forms of PRA, there exists a genetic test, to determine if a dog is a \"carrier, clear, or affected.\"  prcd-PRA. Since the test for prcd-PRA can only reveal the existence of affected or carrier status of this one form of PRA, breeders and owners of the breed should still have regular eye exams by veterinary ophthalmologists. The breed also suffers from another eye disease called Keratoconjunctivitis sicca or dry eye syndrome (DES).Along with Kerry Blue Terriers, Cresteds can develop canine multiple system degeneration (CMSD) also called progressive neuronal abiotrophy (PNA) in Kerry Blue Terriers.  This is a progressive movement disorder that begins with cerebellar ataxia between 10 and 14 weeks of age.  After 6 months of age, affected dogs develop difficulty initiating movements and fall frequently.  The gene responsible has been mapped to canine chromosome 1.As with all other toy breeds, the Cresteds can be prone to patellar luxation.  This inheritable condition is caused by shallow knee joints (stifles) and results in kneecaps that pop out of place. Its onset is often at a young age, and can cause temporary to permanent lameness based on the severity.  Breeders should have their stock certified free of patellar luxation. Many countries' kennel clubs maintain a centralised registry for health results.Allergy and autoimmune diseases have been observed in the breed. The severity of these ailments, which can lead to the premature death of the dog, means this is something breeders need to take seriously in order to avoid it becoming a problem for the breed.\nHealthy dogs have the following statistics:\nLifespan: 12\u201314 years, although many have been known to live much longer\nWeight: 7\u201312 lbs/4\u20135 kg\nHeight: 10\u201313 inches/30 cm\nColor: Any color or combination of colors\n\n\n== History ==\nAlthough hairless dogs have been found in many places in the world, it is unlikely that the origins of the modern Chinese crested dogs are in China. The breed was believed by some to have originated in Africa and was called the African Hairless Terrier in several 19th Century texts, however, there is genetic evidence that shows a shared origin with the Mexican Hairless Dog (X\u014dl\u014ditzcuintli). The current name of the breed likely comes from their use on Chinese ships as ratters. They are also believed to have been bred as a companion for people living with an intellectual disability and as such can remain healthy with little exercise.\nIn the 1950s, Debora Wood created the \"Crest Haven\" kennel and began to purposefully breed and record the lineages of her Chinese crested dogs. The famous burlesque dancer Gypsy Rose Lee also bred Chinese crested dogs, and upon her death her dogs were incorporated into Crest Haven. These two lines are the true foundation of every Chinese crested dog alive today. Ms. Wood also founded the American Hairless Dog Club in 1959, which was eventually incorporated into the American Chinese Crested Club (ACCC) in 1978. The ACCC became the US parent club for the breed when the Chinese crested dog was recognized by the American Kennel Club thirteen years later, in 1991.\nThe Chinese crested dog was officially recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1987, by  The Kennel Club (UK) in 1981, by the American Kennel Club in 1991, and by the Australian National Kennel Council in 1995.\n\n\n== Breeding ==\n\nThe Hairless allele (the wild type) is a dominant (and homozygous prenatal lethal) trait, while the Powderpuff allele acts as a simple recessive trait in its presence.  Zygotes that receive two copies of the Hairless allele will never develop into puppies.  Thus all Chinese crested dogs carry at least one copy of the Powderpuff allele.\nThe Powderpuff trait cannot be bred out because it is carried by all Chinese crested dogs (even the hairless ones).  All Hairless Chinese crested dogs have the ability to produce Powderpuff puppies, even when they are bred to another Hairless. On the other hand, a Powderpuff bred to another Powderpuff can never produce hairless puppies, since they do not carry the Hairless gene.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nOne famous Chinese crested dog was the hairless purebred named Sam. He was the winner of the World's Ugliest Dog Contest from 2003 to 2005; he passed away before he could compete in 2006. Other Chinese cresteds, either purebreds or mixes, have finished high in the event as well.\nSome Chinese crested dog have also appeared as a characters in movies and TV shows such as,\n\nPeek from Cats & Dogs and Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore\nFluffy from 102 Dalmatians\nRomeo from Hotel for Dogs\nGiuseppe from Marmaduke\nHalston from Ugly Betty\nReinaldo from New York Minute\nKrull the Warrior King from How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\nOtis from Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure\nLackey from Good Boy!\nBobby from The Young and the Restless\n\n\n== See also ==\nCompanion dog\nCompanion Dog Group\nToy Group\nLap dog\nMexican Hairless Dog\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChinese Crested Dog at Curlie"}, {"id": 143, "name": "Chinese Imperial Dog", "country": "China", "type": "", "picture": "dog143", "description": "The Chinese Imperial Dog  is a Toy dog breed with a wrinkly, short-muzzled face, and curled tail.

The purpose of the Chinese Imperial Dog is considered a [1]. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe Chinese Imperial Dog was first bred in China in the Imperial Palace where the smaller ones were carried by the nobility in the sleeves of their robes. This breed of dog was gifted to foreign dignities as gifts in Imperial China  After coming to the United States there were always breeders that bred the smaller dogs but the Chinese Imperial Dog did not receive recognition until March 2005. In the 1980s and 1990s the breed got the nicknames \"teacup\", \"mini\", and \"tiny toy\"\n\n\n== Origin Debate ==\nThere is not agreement among experts as to origin date of the Chinese Imperial Dog. The Chinese Imperial Dog Club of America claims that the Chinese Imperial Dog has been in existence for over 2000 while The American Kennel Club claims it has only been in existence since the 1960s.

The Chinook is New Hampshire's official state dog.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nStanding 21 to 27 inches (53 to 69 cm) in height at the withers and weighing 55 to 90 pounds (25 to 41 kg), the Chinook is balanced and muscular. The United Kennel Club (UKC) breed standard states, \"The ideal coloration runs from light honey color to reddish-gold. Black markings on the inside corners of the eyes are preferred. Dark tawny to black markings on the ears and muzzle are preferred. Guard hairs on the tail may be black. No white markings are allowed. Buff markings on the cheeks, muzzle, throat, chest, breeches, toes and underside are acceptable.\" The UKC standard faults any color other than tawny and disqualifies albinism. Other proposed standards state that the medium-length double coat is \"tawny\" in color, with darker shadings on muzzle and ears; white dogs are not allowed, nor are other colors. Eyes are brown to amber in color. Ear carriage is variable, but dropped is preferred and the head more strongly rectangular than other sleddog breeds. The tail is a well-furred saber and not the usual brush or plume of Arctic breeds. Overall, the Chinook seems to owe more to molosser than to spitz ancestry.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Chinook is an affectionate and playful family companion with a special devotion toward children. It is a willing worker who is eager to please and enthusiastic to learn. The Chinook is highly trainable, adaptable, and versatile in his abilities. Gregarious with other dogs, the Chinook works well in teams and within family packs. The Chinook is a dignified dog; some may be reserved with strangers but should never appear shy or aggressive.\n\n\n== Health ==\nHealth issues include normal hereditary problems such as epilepsy, hip dysplasia, and atopy. Also common is cryptorchidism, which occurs in about 10% of all male dogs.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Chinook owes its existence to one man: Arthur Treadwell Walden of Wonalancet, New Hampshire. The breed derives principally from one male ancestor born in 1917, named \"Chinook\", who was Walden's lead dog and stud. \"Chinook\" derived from a crossbreeding of husky stock from the Peary North Pole expedition with a large, tawny Mastiff-like male. Photos of \"Chinook\" show a drop-eared dog with a broad Mastiff head and muzzle. Walden's leader was bred to Belgian Sheepdogs, German Shepherd Dogs, Canadian Eskimo Dogs and perhaps other breeds; the progeny were bred back to him to set the desired type and was apparently a strong reproducer of his own traits. Arthur Walden was an experienced dog driver with years of experience in the Yukon; he was the lead driver and trainer on Byrd's 1929 Antarctic expedition. He is credited with bringing sled dog sports to New England and with founding the New England Sled Dog Club in 1924. The 12-year-old \"Chinook\" was lost on the Byrd expedition.\nControl of the core breeding stock passed from Walden to Julia Lombard and from her to Perry Greene in the late 1940s. Greene, a noted outdoorsman, bred Chinooks in Waldoboro, Maine, for many years until his death in 1963. Rare and closely held by Greene who was for many years the only breeder of Chinooks, the population dwindled rapidly after his death. By 1981 only eleven breedable Chinooks survived. Breeders in Maine, Ohio and California divided the remaining stock and managed to save the type from extinction.\nThe Chinook obtained registered status with the UKC in 1991; current numbers of registered animals are around 800. Only about 100 puppies are born annually worldwide. The registry has a cross-breeding program under which Chinooks are bred to individuals of other breeds thought to have contributed to Chinook development; fourth-generation backcross descendants of such crosses may be accepted as UKC purebred Chinooks if they meet the Chinook Owner Association's Cross Breeding Program requirements.Chinooks joined the American Kennel Club (AKC) Foundation Stock Service in 2001 and were later added to the AKC's Miscellaneous Class in 2010. Finally, in January 2013 the Chinook became the AKC's 176th breed and joined the working group. Chinooks are still working for recognition from other major kennel clubs.\n\n\n=== Working life ===\nAlthough still used for recreational dog sledding by some owners, Chinooks today appear to be used largely as family pets. Individuals are also used for dog-packing, search and rescue, skijoring, and obedience and dog agility trials.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChinook (dog) at Curlie\nThe Chinook Owners Association  UKC Parent Club for the Chinook\nhttp://www.chinookclubofamerica.org AKC Parent Club for the Chinook"}, {"id": 145, "name": "Chippiparai", "country": "India", "type": "", "picture": "dog145", "description": "The Chippiparai is a sighthound breed of dog from the south of India. Thought to be a descendant of the Saluki or Sloughi, today it is found in the area around Periyar Lake. It is used primarily for hunting wild boar, deer and hare. It is also used for guarding the home. Bred by royal families in Chippiparai in Virudhunagar district Tamil Nadu, it was kept as a symbol of royalty and dignity mostly in Tirunelveli and Madurai rulers.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe typical color is a fawn, reddish brown,  black tinged coat, silver-grey, with very limited or no white markings and long curved tail. Other colors, particularly variations of grey and fawn, also occur. This is a medium dog, around 25 inches or 63.5 cm at the withers., in a recent study males averaged approximately 63.0 cm and females approximately 56.0 cm at the withers. It has a short coat that is very close; on the whole the coat if kept groomed has a shine on it. A shining, shell-like appearance is greatly desired. This kind of coat makes it ideal for hot climates. This hound is also less prone to ticks and fleas, with their short coat providing easy detection. The overall appearance is very similar to that of the Sloughi, or the Rampur Greyhound.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe Chippiparai is a robust animal needing little or no veterinary care. It is so active during young stages. It does need lots of exercise, as it was and is a breed meant to hunt. Chippiparai is an intelligent breed and a wonderful watch dog. Contrary to the belief that it is a one -man dog, Chippiparai gets along well with people if it is properly socialized. Chippiparai loves human companionship and it hates to be in isolation. It is capable of great speed and can overtake a hare with ease.\nThe Chippiparai is not a fussy eater. It is easy to groom and does not shed much due to its short coat length.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nGenerally the breed is  healthy. Though sturdy enough to cope within limited means and harsh weather conditions, the breed does suffer from cold weather.   They have certain   general health issues such as: sensitivity to anesthesia and food allergies.\n\n\n== Future of the breed ==\nThe breed is rare in dog show circles.

One writer has proposed that the Chow Chow originated in China 2,000 years ago or originated in Arctic Asia 3,000 years ago and then migrated to Mongolia, Siberia and then to China.One Chinese legend mentions large war dogs from Central Asia that resembled black-tongued lions. One Chinese ruler was said to own 5,000 Chows. The Chinese also used Chows to pull dog sleds, and this was remarked upon by Marco Polo. One author states that the Chow Chow was also bred for human consumption.A legend says that the original teddy bears were modeled after Queen Victoria's Chow Chow puppy. It's said that she carried the dog everywhere she went. Her friends disapproved, claiming that it did not befit a Queen to be seen everywhere with a dog, so they paid a dressmaker to make a stuffed version of the animal for her.Today, the AKC registers approximately 10,000 Chow Chows a year. The Canadian Kennel Club registers approximately 350.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Chow Chow  is a sturdily built dog, square in profile, with a broad skull and small, triangular, erect ears with rounded tips. The breed is known for a very dense double coat that is either smooth or rough. The fur is particularly thick in the neck area, giving it a distinctive ruff or mane appearance. The coat may be shaded/self-red, black, blue, cinnamon/fawn, or cream.\nNot all these color varieties are recognized as valid in all countries.  Individuals with patchy or multicolored coats are considered to be outside the breed standard.  \nChow Chow eyes are typically deep set and almond shaped. The breed is distinguished by its unusual blue-black/purple tongue and very straight hind legs, resulting in a rather stilted gait. The bluish color extends to the Chow Chow's lips; this is the only dog breed with this distinctive bluish color in its lips and oral cavity (other dogs have black or a piebald pattern skin in their mouths). One other distinctive feature is the curly tail. It has thick hair and lies curled on its back. The nose should be black, but blue-coated Chow Chow can have a solid blue or slate-colored nose. According to the American Kennel Club breed standards, any other tone is not acceptable for contests. FCI countries, however, do allow a self-colored nose in the cream.The blue-black/purple tongue gene appears to be dominant, as most mixed breed dogs that come from a Chow Chow retain that tongue colour. However, the blue-black/purple tongue can also be found on the Shar Pei. This is not to say that every mixed breed dog with spots of purple on the tongue is descended from Chow Chow, as purple spots on the tongue can be found on other purebred dogs.\nThe distinctive Chow Chow features\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nMost commonly kept as pets, Chow Chows tend to display discernment of strangers and can become fiercely protective of their owners and property. The American Kennel Club standards, however, consider an all-too aggressive or all-too timid Chow Chow to be unacceptable. For that reason, some owners have attributed a cat-like personality to the Chow Chow.Chow Chow are not excessively active, meaning that they can be housed in an apartment. However, a Chow Chow living in an apartment will need daily exercise to prevent restlessness and boredom. Upon realizing that exercise is a daily occurrence, Chow Chow will tend to be more assertive with owners in anticipation of such activities.\nThis breed of dog has many strong loyal bonds with friends and family, but the Chow Chow dog is usually overly protective of one or two main family members. It is in the breed\u2019s nature to be quiet and well behaved, but it is also resistant to training. Chow Chows become very stubborn and attach to certain individuals as they age. This is why training them when they are puppies is so crucial because they gain respect for those who care for them.\nIn order to avoid aggression and over-protectiveness as an adult, continuous socialization as early as possible could allow the dog to adjust. When Chow Chows have reached adolescence they reject authority from any other owner who failed to earn its admiration. Aggression can be one distinctive behavioural characteristic in this breed, though while some are of an aggressive nature, many are known to be easy-going in nature - sometimes adopting an aloof disposition to individuals other than their owners. Aggression when it does appear is often towards other dogs of the same sex, especially Chows. Due to their strong hunting instincts, it is recommended that these dogs stay fenced, leashed, and away from cats and small dogs. This is why it is crucial that they are socialized early and consistently in order to act appropriately with strangers. \nAt first, chow chows are very hesitant in interacting with strangers. However, this problem can be avoided if the owners train the chow chow at a young age.\nOwning a Chow Chow can raise the cost of homeowners insurance because some companies consider them high-risk dogs. In a study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Chow Chow were responsible for 8 out of 238 fatalities related to dog bites from 1979 to 1998.\nThe different Chow Chow colours\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Chow Chow can suffer from entropion, glaucoma, juvenile cataracts, lymphoma, hip dysplasia, diabetes mellitus, canine pemphigus, and gastric cancer. Chow Chows are a high risk breed for autoimmune disease and are at a predisposition for skin melanoma.Due to the Chow Chow's thick coat, fleas can be a problem.\n\n\n== Notable owners ==\n\nKonrad Lorenz  an Austrian zoologist, ethologist, and ornithologist, winner of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine  who is often regarded as one of the founders of modern ethology, had a Chow Chow mix named Stasi. He wrote about his dogs in his book King Solomon's Ring.\nSigmund Freud had a Chow Chow named Jo-Fi who attended all of his therapy sessions because he felt that dogs had a special sense that allows them to judge a person's character accurately, and admitted he depended on Jo-Fi for an assessment of a patient's mental state.\nU.S. Navy admiral George Dewey acquired a Chow Chow in Hong Kong in 1898 and named it Bob. Bob rarely left the admiral's side and had the run of the cruiser USS Olympia. Bob died in 1899 due to eating chocolates given to Dewey by well-wishers upon Olympia's arrival in New York City.\nMartha Stewart owns several chows, which are frequently seen on Martha's shows. One of them is named Genghis Khan.President Calvin Coolidge and his wife owned a black Chow named Timmy.Elvis Presley and his girlfriend Linda Thompson had a Chow Chow named Getlow.Vanna Bonta has a cream Chow Chow named Sky, a blue Chow Chow named Seraph, and a red Chow Chow named Beowulf, who was immortalized as a fictional dog in the book \u2018\u2019Flight\u2019\u2019.\nJanet Jackson had a Chow Chow named Buckwheat.Italian footballer Mario Balotelli bought his girlfriend two Chow Chow puppies in the UK.\n\n\n== Grooming ==\nChow breed will heavily shed their fur in the seasons of spring and fall, which requires more grooming attention than other seasons. It is important that owners use the correct tool in order to avoid harming the skin and facilitate grooming. Three kinds of brushes that owners can use on their Chow Chow are a medium-coarse brush for the larger parts of the body, a slick brush for smaller areas, and a pin brush to maintain the longer strands of hair. Chow Chows are known to have either short and smooth coat, or a rougher and longer coat. Both create a thick woolly layer, as it gets closer to the skin. They should be brushed four times a week; however shedding seasons may require daily grooming. Also, a spray conditioner can help avoiding breakage and tearing to the thick coat of hair. Lastly, a monthly bath is required to avoid fleas and keep a clean coat of fur.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nEurasier, a dog breed created crossing Chow Chow and the Keeshond\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChow Chow at Curlie"}, {"id": 147, "name": "Cierny Sery", "country": "Slovakia", "type": "", "picture": "dog147", "description": "The Cierny Sery has a thin, double, coat that was designed to not inhibit the dog's working ability in any way.

It is the largest of the spaniels, and comes in predominantly white with either lemon or orange markings. The name of the breed is taken from Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire where the breed was first developed. It is a gundog that specialises in hunting in heavy cover. They are gentle and loyal, and can act aloof with strangers. They have several habits which could be considered disadvantages, including a constant shedding of its coat and snoring.\nThe history of the breed is uncertain prior to the mid-19th century with two theories being prevalent. Clumber Spaniels have been kept and bred by various members of the British Royal Family, including Prince Albert, King Edward VII and King George V. They were introduced into Canada in 1844, and in 1884 became one of the first ten breeds recognised by the American Kennel Club. The breed can suffer from a variety of breed-specific ailments varying in severity from temporary lameness due to bone growth whilst young to hip dysplasia or spinal disc herniation.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Clumber Spaniel is the largest of the spaniels, and is long and heavy-bodied, standing only 17 to 20 inches (43 to 51 cm) in height but weighing from 55 to 85 pounds (25 to 39 kg). It is similar in shape to the smaller Sussex Spaniel. The Clumber has a heavy bone structure, has a massive 'melting' head with a mournful and dopey expression, a square nose and muzzle, and large vine-leaf shaped ears. Freckles on the muzzle and front legs are common. Its coat is dense, weather-resistant, straight, and flat with feathering around the ears, belly and legs. Clumbers are predominantly white in colour with lemon, brown, or orange markings around the eyes, and at the base of the tail.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nTheir temperament is described as gentle, loyal and affectionate, but dignified and aloof with strangers. They can appear to be a sedate breed and enjoy curling up on the couch, eating and sleeping.Clumber Spaniels shed at a medium pace. Clumbers tend to drool because of their very droopy flews. Clumbers have minds of their own. Puppies are especially curious and playful. The breed has a trophy mentality and the dog has an incessant need to carry something most of the time; unfortunately this can lead to health issues as they may ingest the items.The breed has been used to hunt pheasant and partridge, in both small packs and alone. It is well-suited for work in upland hunting in dense cover, and although the Clumber is rather slow in the field compared to other spaniels, it is a quiet worker with a fine nose and good stamina. The broad muzzle of the breed allows it to retrieve a variety of game.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nBecause Clumber Spaniels are large boned and fast growing, they can suffer from temporary lameness from between six and twelve months of age, with this lameness subsiding when bone growth is complete. Another common condition that the breed suffers from are impacted anal sacs and the dog may require them to be emptied by a veterinarian. The final common condition that the breed has is heat sensitivity: if Clumber Spaniels are left without shade, they can become uncomfortably hot and dehydrated.In addition, Clumbers often have difficulties conceiving and giving birth, and may require caesarian sections. Some dogs may suffer from sensitivity to anaesthesia. The most common severe health conditions in the Clumber Spaniel are entropion/ectropion eye conditions, spinal disc herniation and hip dysplasia. They have a median lifespan of around 10 years.\n\n\n=== Entropion/Ectropion ===\nEntropion is the inward rolling of the eyelid, commonly the lower lid. This in turn irritates the cornea of the eye and can cause visual impairment. It is a hereditary disorder seen in both English and American Cocker Spaniels, King Charles Spaniels, English Springer Spaniels plus a variety of non spaniel breeds.Ectropion is the outward rolling of the eyelid, which abnormally exposes the eye, resulting in irritation. Because of the increased exposure, the dog can develop allergic or bacterial conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis sicca also known as dry-eye syndrome. It is most commonly found in breeds with exaggerated facial features such as the Boxer, Bloodhound, Gordon Setter as well as the English and American Cocker Spaniels, and the English Springer Spaniel.The treatment for ectropion varies depending on the severity of the condition. The only treatment for entropion is surgical, and may be delayed until the dog reaches adulthood as whilst a puppy the facial structures of the animal are still growing and changing. Dogs who have surgical correction for defects such as entropion or ectropion may not be exhibited in the show ring.\n\n\n=== Spinal disc herniation ===\n\nSpinal disc herniation occurs when the Intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. Once the cord is compressed, the dog experiences symptoms ranging from mild back/neck pain to leg paralysis, loss of sensation, and urinary and fecal incontinence. The most commonly location seen is the mid-back area, but it may occur anywhere along the spine. Cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, and this can be accompanied by medication for the pain. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.\n\n\n=== Hip dysplasia ===\nHip dysplasia   is a hereditary condition which occurs in most dog breeds to some extent, according to scores from a 2001 UK Kennel Club scheme, the Clumber Spaniel has the second worst breed mean scores. Furthermore, a survey conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals found that 45.7% of Clumber Spaniels tested were affected by the condition. Initial signs are usually first noted when the dog is between five and twelve months old, and may include a swaying hindleg gait, hindleg lameness, muscle wastage around the hindquarters, reluctance to and fatigue during exercise, inability to climb stairs or jump up. The dog can appear hunched up with an arched back, and in the very worst cases may wince with pain when moving its hindlegs. Medical treatment can vary from the administration of painkillers to surgical correction depending on the severity of the condition.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe breed's history is uncertain before the middle of the 19th century. One theory is that it originated in France, stating that the Duc de Noailles at the time of the French Revolution gave his kennel of prized spaniels to the Duke of Newcastle at Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire. The theory goes, that the now extinct Alpine Spaniel was bred with Basset Hounds, and the Pyrenean Mountain Dog also known as the Great Pyrenees. A second theory is that it is descended from the old type of Bleinheim Spaniel, which was later to be incorporated into the King Charles breed of Spaniel. Originally these dogs were large gundogs, colored lemon and white whereas the modern breed of them is a much smaller lap/toy breed of dog.What is certain is that the breed took its name from Clumber Park and that the Duke of Newcastle's gamekeeper, William Mansell, is credited with their development and improvement. Prince Albert, the Prince consort of Queen Victoria, was a fancier and promoter of the breed, as was his son King Edward VII, who bred them at the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. The breed was shown in England from 1859 onward. They are referred to in Queen Victoria's diary: on October 16, 1840, she wrote, \"Walked out directly after breakfast before Albert went to shoot. He had his 7 fine Clumber Spaniels with us and we went into the Slopes, with such a funny old Gamekeeper, Walters, in order that I should see how the dogs found out their game. They are such dear, nice dogs.\"Until the mid 19th century the breeding of the Clumber Spaniel was mostly restricted to the nobility. During World War I breeding was stopped entirely causing their numbers to decrease to a record low. In 1925, King George V re-developed a line of Clumbers in the Royal Kennel and were used in the fields in the Sandringham Estate.Sh. Ch. Raycroft Socialite, bred by Rae Furness and owned by Ralph Dunne of County Cavan, Ireland, won the coveted honor of Best In Show at the 1991 Crufts Centenary Show.The Clumber Spaniel is currently recognised as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the UK Kennel Club, which means it is a breed which fewer than 300 new registrations each year. Other spaniels recognised as such are the Field Spaniel, Irish Water Spaniel and Sussex Spaniel.\n\n\n=== Clumber Spaniels in North America ===\nWhile the breed was not shown widely in the United States prior to the late 1960s, in 1844, Lieutenant Venables, an officer of the British regiment stationed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, introduced the Clumber Spaniel to North America. The first Clumber Spaniel listed in the AKC registry, recorded for the date of 1878 was Bustler, an orange and white dog owned by Benjamin Smith of Nova Scotia. The Clumber Spaniel became one of the first ten breeds recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1884.The first Clumber Spaniel was entered in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1878. Champion Clussexx Country Sunrise (\"Brady\"), bred by Doug Johnson and owned by Richard and Judith Zaleski of Florida, became the only Clumber to win Best in Show there in 1996.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Working Clumber Spaniel Society\nClumber Spaniel at Curlie\nClumber Spaniel Club of America\nClumber Spaniel Club of Canada\nThe Clumber Spaniel Club"}, {"id": 150, "name": "Rough Collie", "country": "United Kingdom, Scotland", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog150", "description": "The Rough Collie (also known as the Long-Haired Collie) is a long-coated breed of medium to large size dog that in its original form was a type of collie used and bred for herding in Scotland. Originating in the 1800s,  it is now well known through the works of author Albert Payson Terhune, and through the Lassie novel, movies, and television shows. There is also a smooth-coated variety; some breed organisations, including both the American and the Canadian Kennel Clubs, consider the smooth-coat and rough-coat dogs to be variations of the same breed. Rough Collies generally come in shades of sable, merles, and tri-coloured. This breed closely resembles the smaller Shetland Sheepdog, but the two breeds do not have an exclusive linear relationship.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBoth Rough and Smooth collies are descended from a localised variety of herding dog originating in Scotland and Wales. The Scottish variety was a large, strong, aggressive dog, bred to herd highland sheep. The Welsh variety was small and nimble, domesticated and friendly, and also herded goats. When the English saw these dogs at the Birmingham market, they interbred them with their own variety of sheepdogs, producing a mixture of short- and long-haired varieties. After the industrial revolution, dog ownership became fashionable, and these early collies were believed to have been crossed with the Borzoi (Russian Wolfhound) to get a more \"noble\" head (longer muzzle), which is today one of the true characteristics of the Rough Collie. It is not known conclusively if the Borzoi cross made it into the mainstream of the breed.\nWhen Queen Victoria acquired a Rough Collie, after seeing one at Balmoral Castle, they were transformed into something of a fashion item. Continued breeding for show purposes drastically changed the appearance of the dogs; in the 1960s, it was a much taller dog than it is today (in the UK; in the US, the size standard has not been revised downward and dogs have remained between 24-26\"). Earlier dogs were also more sturdy in build and reportedly capable of covering up to 100 miles in one day. In the UK the Rough Collie is no longer used for serious herding, having been replaced by the Border Collie, though in the United States and a number of European countries, there has been a resurgence in the use of the Collie as a working and performance dog.The Collie Club of America is one of the oldest breed-specific clubs in existence in the United States (founded in 1886). The Collie Club in England dates from 1881.Quoted from Collie Club of America:\n\nUnfortunately, the Collie's exact origins are shrouded in obscurity. It has been the subject of much research and speculation. The word \"Collie\" is as obscure as the breed itself. The name has been spelled many different ways: Coll, Colley, Coally and Coaly. Generally, the most accepted origin of the word is \"Coll\" - the Anglo-Saxon word for \"black\".\nIn the 18th century, the Rough Collie's natural home was in the highlands of Scotland, where he had been used for centuries as a sheepdog. The dogs were bred with great care in order to assist their masters in the herding and guarding of their flock.\n Without a doubt, it is to the English fancy of the late 1800s that the breed owes its development as a popular show dog. Rough Collies were first exhibited in 1860 at the Birmingham, England dog show, in the generic class \"Scotch Sheep-Dogs\".\nIn 1879 the first English Rough Collie was imported to this country. It is from England that we find the famous pillars of the breed, from which the American fanciers sought not only their next big winner, but also their foundation stock.\n\nBy the turn of the century, the American Rough Collie was in a state of continued development. The breed continued to flourish in England. American show prizes were dominated by the British imports. As a result of the imports, the breed made rapid progress between 1900 to 1920. These dogs built the foundations upon which the present day Rough Collie is based and paved the way for the emergence of the great American kennels of the 1920s and 1930s\nThe word may trace to Gaelic or/and Irish - in which the words for \"doggie\" are, respectively, c\u00e0ilean and c\u00f3ilean.  This would be more consistent with the breed's origin in the Gaelic-speaking Scottish Highlands than an Anglo-Saxon term.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nFour coat colours are recognized for Rough Collies: sable and white, where the \"sable\" ranges from pale tan to a mahogany; tricolour, which is primarily black edged in tan; blue merle, which is mottled gray, White, which is a mainly all-white coat, except for the head, which could be tri, sable or blue. All have white coat areas, in the collar, parts of the leg, and usually the tail tip. Some may have white blazes on their faces. In addition, the American Kennel Club accepts white, where the dog is predominantly white with coloured markings of sable, tricolor, or blue merle on the head and sometimes body patches.Rough Collies have a blunter face than the smaller, but otherwise very similar Shetland Sheepdog, which is partly descended from the Rough Collie. The planes of the muzzle and the top of the skull should be parallel in collies, with a slight but distinct stop. (In shelties, the planes are not parallel.) The downy undercoat is covered by a long, dense, coarse outer coat with a notable ruff around the neck, feathers about the legs, a petticoat on the abdomen, and a frill on the hindquarters.The size and weight varies among breed standards; male collies can stand 55.8 to 66 cm (22 to 26 in) at the shoulder; the female averages 5 cm (2 in) shorter. The males are usually in the weight range (50\u201370 lbs), and the females are usually 5 to 10 lbs less. Collies in the US are sometimes reported to be over a hundred pounds \u2013 a large collie typically weighs no more than 70 pounds. US and UK standards may differ. The UK standard calls for dogs to be significantly smaller than those under the American Kennel Club.One of the characteristic features of the Rough Collie is its head. This is light in relation to the rest of the body, and resembles a blunted wedge tapering smoothly from ears to black nose, with a distinct stop and parallel head planes. The muzzle is well rounded, and never square. There is considerable variation in the colour of the head, however. The eyes are medium-sized and almond shaped. The ears are supposed to be semi-prick, with the upper third folded over. Ears which do not 'tip' properly are fairly common, and many collies have their ears taped as puppies (using medical adhesive or paper tape) to encourage them to lay properly \u2013 no cutting or surgery is involved. They are similar to a Shetland Sheepdog's, but larger.\nOnce seen, the contrast between the Rough Collie head and that of a Border Collie is immediately apparent, the latter having a considerably shorter muzzle and a more distinct stop between muzzle and forehead. The ruff is also distinctive in distinguishing the two breeds.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nRough collies should show no nervousness or aggression, and are generally great with children and other animals. However, they must be well socialised to prevent shyness. They are medium to large sized dogs, and they generally need a home instead of being in a small apartment.  Like many herding dogs, collies can be fairly vocal, and some are easily trained not to bark. The amount of herding instinct varies, with some dogs being quite drivey and others calmer.\nRough Collies are very loyal and may be one-family dogs (although most make exceptions for children), but are very rarely aggressive or protective beyond barking and providing a visual deterrent. They are typically excellent with kids. They are eager to learn and respond best to a gentle hand.\nThe rough collie's long coat has made the breed successful on northern Midwest farms as an able herder and guardian of the farm during the winter. The dog needs to be gradually acclimated to the cold and a suitable insulated outdoor shelter must be provided for the dog along with ample quality food and a source of unfrozen water. The rough collie also relishes playing in the snow with children during the winter months. They guard the farm while the owner is away and are naturally protective of small children.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nWhile Rough Collies are generally resilient and healthy, there are some health problems that can affect the breed.\nCollie eye anomaly (CEA), a genetic disease which causes improper development of the eye and possible blindness, is a common ailment in the breed. More rarely, Rough Collies can be affected by progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), another genetic disease in which bilateral degeneration of the retina results in progressive vision loss culminating in blindness. Through genetic testing and careful screening program it would be theoretically possible to eradicate both of these problems in purebred lines, however, certainly in the UK, the Kennel Club does not require these tests to be done either for registration or showing. CEA is so prevalent that elimination of affected dogs except through very slow and careful breeding decisions to avoid shrinking the gene pool more than absolutely necessary. Rough Collie puppies should be screened at an early age (6\u20138 weeks) by a certified veterinary ophthalmologist to check for CEA. PRA has a later onset and can be detected by DNA test, but is much less widespread (in the US) than CEA. (In the UK, PRA is more common.) Note, the UK Kennel Club \"Accredited Breeder Scheme\" requires eye tests and recommends the genetic test for this class of members.Canine cyclic neutropenia is a cyclic blood disorder that is usually fatal to affected puppies. The disease is also referred to as \"gray collie syndrome\", due to affected puppies having a pale gray, pinkish/gray or beige colouring, none of which are normal Rough Collie colours. Puppies that survive through adulthood are plagued with immune disorders throughout their lives and rarely live more than three years. DNA testing can help detect carriers of the recessive gene that causes the disease.Hip dysplasia: As with most of the larger breeds, hip dysplasia is a potential concern for Rough Collies. Although this disease appears to be \"multigene\", careful selection by many breeders is reducing this problem. The UK Kennel Club \"Accredited Breeder Scheme\" requires hip-scores this class of members, however, a very small proportion of UK registered puppies are bred under this scheme. Hip dysplasia is rare in collies compared to their closest relatives and other breeds of the same size.\nRough Collies may carry a mutant Mdr1 gene that results in a sensitivity to Ivermectin and related drugs. A screening test is used to determine if alternative medications are required. Overdoses from the proscribed medications can result in neurological impairment or even death. This faulty gene is present in several breeds, but is well known among collies.In addition to these problems, all of which can be tested for, there are a number of problems which are thought to be genetic but for which no screening test exists. These include epilepsy, bloat, a tendency towards allergies, and thyroid disorders (primarily hypothyroidism.). Because no DNA tests exist for these disorders (and all can have causes other than genetic origins), breeders can only do their best to avoid producing them by removing affected dogs from the gene pool.\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\n\nThe double-layered coat needs to be brushed frequently and thoroughly to keep it in a show condition. Pet dogs need less maintenance but still a significant amount to keep the dog healthy. The profuse coat picks up grass seeds and burrs, and many dogs tend to mat to some degree, particularly behind the ears, around the collar (if a collar is left on the dog), and in the pants.  Spaying and neutering can alter coat texture, making it softer and more prone to matting.\n\n\n== Working life ==\n\n\n=== Herding ===\n\nIn the 18th century, the Collie's natural home was in the highlands of Scotland, where it had been used for centuries as a sheepdog. The dogs were bred with great care in order to assist their masters in the herding and guarding of their flock.\nCollies are capable of being keen herders while remaining sensible, flexible family companions, whether as working dogs on a ranch or farm or helping out a suburban owner who keeps a few sheep, goats, or ducks as a hobby. Participation in herding helps preserve the special heritage of the Collie and opens up new opportunities for owner and dog. The qualities that make a good herding dog \u2013 trainability, adaptability, loyalty, soundness of body and character, agility, grace \u2013 are important in many areas, and contribute so much toward making the dog an outstanding companion as well.\nThroughout the country there are local herding clubs that provide clinics, work days, trials and tests. Several organizations provide herding title programs in which Collies regularly participate. A Herding Instinct Test introduces Collies and their handlers to herding at the basic level. It is designed to show whether or not a Collie, who may have never had any exposure to livestock, still has the natural instinct to perform the function for which the breed was initially created. It is a non-competitive introduction to carefully selected and easily handled livestock under favorably controlled conditions.\n\n\n=== Activities ===\nRough Collies can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, conformation, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Rough Collies exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials. The breed has also been known to work as search and rescue dogs, therapy dogs and guide dogs for the blind.\n\n\n== Notable Rough Collies ==\n\nLassie, a line of Rough Collies originally owned by Rudd Weatherwax that have starred in numerous films, multiple television series, a radio program, and has been the subject of various novels and non-fiction works. One of the few animal actors to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nReveille is the name of the current mascot of Texas A&M University. Since Reveille III became mascot in 1966, each dog to bear that name has been a Rough Collie; the current mascot is Reveille IX. When she assumed her duties in 2015, she was formerly named Twix. She was donated by breeders Marcy and Mike Fine, Overland Collies, from Chagrin Falls, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb.\nDog, John Wayne's four-legged sidekick in the 1971 film Big Jake. \nDR Dakota, was the collie that performed the action shots in the latest Lassie film.\nLad, the main hero of Albert Payson Terhune's early 20th-century novels about his Sunnybank Rough Collies.\nPal, the first Rough Collie to portray Lassie and from whom the Lassie line is descended.\nCh.

It is a short-coated version of the Rough Collie of Lassie fame. Some breed organisations consider the smooth-coat and rough-coat dogs to be variations of the same breed.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe early history of the Smooth Collie, like that of many dog breeds, is largely a matter of speculation. The most common view of the breed is that they are descended from a population of shepherds' dogs brought to Scotland by the Romans around the 5th century. Even the origin of the breed's name is unclear, variously claimed to describe the early shepherd dog's dark colour (\"coaly\"), or derived from the name of a breed of sheep with black faces once commonly kept in Scotland (\"Colley\"), or derived from an Anglo-Saxon word meaning \"useful.\" The word could also trace to Gaelic or/and Irish - in which the words for \"doggie\" are, respectively, c\u00e0ilean and c\u00f3ilean. This would be more consistent with the breed's origin in the Gaelic-speaking Scottish Highlands than an Anglo-Saxon term.\n\nThe modern history of both the Smooth and Rough Collie began in the reign of Queen Victoria, who became interested in the shepherds' dogs while at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. In 1860, she purchased some of the dogs for her own kennel. With the Queen's interest, it became fashionable to own Smooth Collies. Thus began the breed's transformation from working farm dog, similar to the modern Border collie, to the dog bred as a pet and for the sport of conformation showing that we know today.\nThe Smooth Collie today is considered a variety of the same breed as the Rough Collie in the United States,Canada, meaning that they can interbreed and some statistics are kept only for \"Collie\" rather than for both varieties individually. The smooth and rough are classified as separate breeds in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, and Australia. The latter is a fairly recent development, however, with the Kennel Club (UK) allowing the interbreeding of the two varieties until 1993.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Smooth Collie is a medium-large dog, ranging in size from 20\u201322 inches (51\u201356 cm) for females and 22\u201324 inches (56\u201361 cm) for males at the shoulder; weights vary from 40 lb (18 kg)  for females up to 66 lb (30 kg) for males. Standard size for the breed is in the United States and Canada 22\u201324 inches (56\u201361 cm) for females and 24\u201326 inches (61\u201366 cm) for males at the shoulder; for example, for the AKC, the range is 22\u201326 inches (56\u201366 cm) and 50\u201375 lb (23\u201334 kg).\n\nThe Smooth Collie is slightly longer than it is tall, with a level back and a deep chest. The features of the head, particularly the \"sweet\" expression, are considered very important in the show ring. The breed has a long muzzle, flat skull, and semi-erect ears (although, in practice, the ears typically must be folded over and taped in puppyhood, or they will usually be fully upright in the adult dog).\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nThe coat consists of a soft, extremely dense undercoat and straight, harsh outer guard hairs. The guard hairs are one to two inches long, with the longer hair mainly in a ruff around the neck and on the backs of the thighs. The coat requires a thorough weekly brushing. Shedding is moderate most of the year, heavy during the twice-yearly shedding season.\n\n\n=== Colour ===\nSmooth Collies come in four colours:  sable (Lassie's colour; can be light gold to deep mahogany); tricolour (black, with tan and white markings); and blue merle (silvery gray marbled with black, and tan markings), all marked with white areas on the chest, neck, feet/legs, and tail tip. An additional colour is white (these Collies are predominantly white, with heads and usually a body spot of sable, tri, or blue colour). The fourth colour is sable merle, which is a light stippled version of sable, sometimes (as with blue merle) accompanied by blue or merled (parti-coloured) eyes. Blue eyes or merled eyes in a non-blue merle collie are not disqualifications in the AKC standard although they are heavily penalised. There are, however, plenty of blue-eyed or merled-eyed sable merle collies who are AKC breed champions.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Smooth Collie is generally a sociable, easily trained family dog. Although not an aggressive breed, they are alert and vocal, making them both good watchdogs if well trained and potential nuisances if allowed to bark indiscriminately. Collies are agile and active dogs and need regular exercise in some way.  This breed is easy to train, due to its high intelligence and eagerness to please its owners. Training this breed requires a light touch, as they are sensitive to correction and shy away from harsh treatment. They get along well with children and other animals, usually getting along with other dogs.\nSmooth Collies are used both as family pets and in obedience competition, agility, herding trials, and other dog sports. Some are still used as working sheepdogs. They are also very useful as assistance dogs for the disabled.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Smooth Collie is a long-lived breed for its size, usually living 12 to 14 years. Like all dog breeds, they are susceptible to certain inherited or partially inherited health problems. Those problems currently include:\n\nCollie eye anomaly (CEA): A collection of eye problems ranging from minor blood vessel abnormalities to blind spots to severely deformed or detached retinas. This problem is so widespread in collies that completely unaffected dogs (called \"normal eyed\") are uncommon, although conscientious breeders have been able to gradually increase the normal population. The problem and its extent can be determined through an eye exam conducted before six weeks of age, and does not get worse over time. Mildly affected dogs suffer no impairments, and are fine pets or working dogs.\nProgressive retinal atrophy: Gradual degeneration of the retinas of the eyes, eventually leading to blindness. This disease is less common than CEA in Collies, but more difficult to breed away from, as symptoms are not usually detectable until the affected dog is middle-aged or older.\nMultidrug sensitivity: Sometimes fatal reactions to a class of common drugs, particularly ivermectin, used as a heartworm preventative and treatment for mites. The gene that causes this sensitivity has recently been identified, and a dog's susceptibility can now be determined through a simple blood test.\nGastric dilatation volvulus (bloat): A painful and often fatal twisting of the stomach occurring in large or deep-chested breeds which can usually be prevented by feeding small meals and not allowing vigorous exercise immediately before or after eating.\nEpilepsy: Seizures of unknown origin. Frequency of the seizures can often be significantly reduced through medication, but there is no cure for this disease.\nCyclic Neutropenia: CN is also known as Gray Collie Syndrome. Cyclic Neutropenia is a disease that affects the neutrophils of a dog, which are an integral part of the dog's immune system. Most affected dogs will die as puppies, and even with the best care, the dog will not likely live past 2\u20133 years of age.Smooth Collies can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Collies exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCollie\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nClark, Stella.

It is considered an extremely loyal, intelligent and powerful native breed.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Combai is usually tan or red brown mostly found with a black mask at muzzle, pendant, pricked ears and fairly square bodied dog where it's height and length are almost equal. Rear leg angulation is closely related to that of terrier and are highly energetic and loyal breed. Height for Combai is around 23-25\"for males although females are two inches shorter, weight is around 30 kilo grams for males and females are nearly five kilo grams lighter. Their coats are easily maintainable, and are less prone to skin disorders, fungal and yeast infections, and parasite infestation. The breed, having evolved naturally many centuries ago, is more immune to most diseases compared to the human-designed breeds.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nAs a guard dog, the combai is very effective , alert and adaptable to the conditions. It is fairly aggressive towards strangers, and is aloof to them. The combai were used As Home and Livestock guardian as it has high pain tolerance. Nowadays, these are mostly used as guard dogs in farm houses. Years ago they were used to guard people's cattle from tigers and leopards. \nA combai is an intelligent and sensible dog breed, always ready to please its master and other family members. It is athletic, intelligent and alert, radiating calm dog energy (CDE) much like the Rottweiler. Contrary to the popular belief of its ferocious temper, the combai is very alert, a good family dog, loves to play with children and enjoys human companionship. It clearly senses who is welcome and who is not. As an intelligent dog, the combai strives to please its master and generally responds to the mood and command of its master from its infancy. \nCombai may seen lazy and sleepy but in seconds they become alert. In demanding circumstances, they can fight intruders (whether humans or animals) until death.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Kombai is an ancient breed of dog, used in hunting. The Kombai was used for hunting boar, bison and deer. Once available in large numbers throughout Southern India, the Kombai is now restricted to certain parts of Tamil Nadu .The Kombai\u2019s existence can be traced back to the 15th century and historically, they are known to have been bred to hunt wild boar, deer, and bison. Some breed enthusiasts and natives of South India believe that the breed existed even as far back as the 9th century. Kombais were used by the armies of the Marudhu brothers or Marudhu Pandias, who headed the revolt against the British subjugation of the Kalaiar Koil of the Sivaganga Kingdom at the beginning of the 19th century.Kombais continue to be popular in South India and are celebrated as not just strong hunters but loyal family pets.

The Cordoba was a crossbreed of Alano Espa\u00f1ol, Mastiff, Bull Terrier, Bulldog and Boxer.. Its temperament includes being very fierce, very aggressive, \nstrong, vigorous, and relentless (high stamina).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Cordoba Fighting Dog originated in C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina.  It was noted for its willingness to fight to the death and its high pain tolerance. In addition, many members of this breed died in the dog fighting pits, contributing to the breed's extinction.\nThe Cordoba was capable of hunting in a small pack of a male and female; otherwise it was likely to turn on its pack-mates.\nThe Dogo Argentino is directly derived from this breed. In the 1920s, breeders developed the Dogo Argentino by crossing the Cordoba Fighting Dog with other breeds such as the Great Dane, Great Pyrenees, Bulldog, Bull Terrier and Dogue de Bordeaux.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of dog fighting breeds\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 154, "name": "Coton de Tulear", "country": "Madagascar", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog154", "description": "The Coton de Tul\u00e9ar is a breed of small dog named for the city of Tul\u00e9ar in Madagascar and for its cotton-like coat. They typically grow to no more than 18 pounds, and are white, sometimes with gray, black, or tricolored markings.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nMultiple registries with differing standards describe the Coton de Tulear, but it generally has very soft hair (as opposed to fur), comparable to a cotton ball (hence its name in French, coton meaning cotton), a prominent black nose, large expressive eyes (usually covered by bangs), and somewhat short legs. The Coton de Tulear's tail should curl over its back.\n\n\n==== Coat and color ====\n\nThe Coton de Tul\u00e9ar has a medium-to-long, fluffy, cotton-like coat that is considered hair rather than fur. It is a non-shedding breed with low dander and is considered hypoallergenic. When it is a puppy, it may shed its puppy coat. Like the poodles or the Havanese, this breed has very low allergic effects. Matted hair is common for this breed and should be removed through daily brushing and combing. Grooming the Coton de Tulear can be quite a challenge.\nThis breed does not have the common \"doggie smell\" and, when properly bathed and groomed, has little to no odor.\n\nThe Coton de Tulear comes in three accepted colors: white (sometimes with tan markings; all white is preferred by show breeders); black and white; and tricolor. However, the tan and white may become all white, the blacks will often fade to grey or white, and fur will most likely change throughout puppyhood. The breed even has a fade gene that causes the colors, which are very dark when a puppy, to fade and turn white at the base of the hair as it lengthens; that is why the Champagne or Champagne Teddy Bear Coton eventually turns white when the adult hair comes in.) The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale standard specifies that the Coton's coat should be white, but may also have tan or \"lemon\" color on their ears and body. The coat, however, must be primarily white with no black hair. The US-based Coton de Tulear Club of America allows for three different but equally favorable colorings: white, black-and-white, and tri-color, which includes \"honey bear\". White is described as nearly all white, sometimes with tan or champagne coloring on the ears, face or back. Black-and-white is defined as pure white with prominent black patches on the head and body (no ratio of white-to-black is specified or favored). Tri-color is described as mostly white with some brown markings and dustings of black on the body and head. A honey bear tri-color has light brown with black tips that gradually fades to an off-white or lemon color. The tri-color loses the most color of any of the color varieties, usually becoming mostly white with possibly some champagne markings and a dusting of black hairs on the ears and/or body.\n\n\n==== Size ====\nThe F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale standard gives the Coton's weight as 6 to 8 kg (13 to 18 lb) for males and 3.5 to 5 kg (7.7 to 11.0 lb) for females. The Coton's height (including tolerance) is 25 to 30 cm (9.8 to 11.8 in) tall for males and 22 to 27 cm (8.7 to 10.6 in) for females.However, the Coton de Tulear Club of America standard specifies the weight as no more than 18 lb (8.2 kg), with the average being between 11 to 15 lb (5.0 to 6.8 kg). The standard height is 9 to 13 in (23 to 33 cm), except for the rare Tall Coton, which is 15 to 17 in (38 to 43 cm) tall. The long-limbed Tall Coton shows up in all three color varieties and can be born to a litter with normal-sized parents that carry the appropriate genes.\n\n\n==== Detailed description ====\nThe nose is black in colour in the Coton de Tulear Club of America standard. However, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale standard, which also favors a black nose, states that brown is tolerable as well. A pink or partly pink nose is not accepted in either standard. The standard advocates that the lips should preferably be tight and of the same colour as the nose, specifically black in the Coton de Tulear Club of America standard. A Coton de Tulear's teeth can be either in a scissor bite or pincer bite. Its eyes are normally round, dark in colour, and wide set. Traditionally, the expression is lively, intelligent, bright, and merry. Typically, the Coton de Tulear's ears are triangular and set high. The leather of the ear is often thin, and the neck is strong, favoured to be without a dewlap, and slightly arched.\nThe chest is typically well developed and reaches to (FCI-Standard N\u00b0 283 / 04. 02. 2000 / GB) the elbows. A Coton de Tulear's feet are small and arched, and its back is normally strong and slightly arched. The pads of the feet are usually black. The body is of moderate length and typically has a moderate tuck-up. Traditionally, the loin is muscular and not overly long in length. The hind legs are normally strong and straight. The hind feet are similar to the front feet. Throughout history the dewclaws have been removed, however many would now oppose this arguably unnecessary and cruel procedure. The tail is traditionally low-set and tapering, carried over the back when in motion or excited, but relaxed otherwise.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Coton is a playful, affectionate, intelligent breed. Although generally quiet, it can become very vocal -- grunting, barking, and making other noises when having fun. Cotons are known to have a habit of jumping up and walking on their hind legs to please people. Most Cotons love meeting new people and are very curious in new situations. Cotons are easy to train as they are very eager to please. Cotons love to swim, run, and play. They adapt well to any kind of living environment. A common trait of the Coton de Tulear behavior is to come alive in the evening.\n\n\n== Care ==\nThe Coton has a coat that requires brushing and combing almost daily and bathing about once per week to maintain its beauty. Cotons love swimming; owners who have pools are recommended to let their Cotons play in the pool with supervision. Like poodles, they do not \"shed\", meaning they don't drop hair on furniture, carpeting, etc. They do lose hair; the texture of their coat causes the shed hair to be trapped in the coat. If not brushed and combed daily, the fur of this breed will mat up quickly and may require shaving. Cotons need a walk every day for exercise, but will appreciate a play session as often as possible, and have the endurance to go on a long hike. Cotons love to play with other dogs and they are great with kids.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThe Coton is in general a healthy breed. However, there are still some health issues as there are in all breeds. The most serious issues are heart problems, liver shunts, back (disc) problems, and eye problems. Luckily, these are still relatively uncommon in the breed. The small gene pool of this breed is owing to its near extinction. Due to inbreeding by disreputable breeders there is an increased incidence of disease. The smaller the gene pool, the more likely a breed is to have genetic abnormalities.\nThe Coton de Tulear has few health issues compared to many other breeds due to being rather generic in type. It is a fairly rare breed and is just now being accepted and recognized by the AKC as of 2012. The fact that this is a breed being revived from extinction means that the Coton de Tulear is rather expensive to purchase and prices may reach $1,800.00-$3,500 per dog. The average life span of a Coton de Tulear is 14 to 19 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Coton de Tulear developed on the island of Madagascar and is still the island's national dog. It is believed that the Tenerife dog was brought to Madagascar and mated with a dog of the island, creating an unexpected result. The Coton's ancestors were possibly brought to Madagascar in the 16th and 17th centuries aboard pirate ships. Madagascar was a haven for pirates and pirate graveyards can still be seen there. Pirates established a base on St. Mary's Island, Madagascar and some of them took Malagasy wives. Whether the dogs were brought along to control rats on the ships, as companions for long voyages, or were confiscated from other ships as booty, no one knows. Tulear is a port now also known as Toliara. The Coton is of the Bichon dog type, linked most closely to the Bichon Tenerife and the Tenerife Terrier. There have been many stories circulating about the history of the Coton in recent years, most of them untrue. The Coton de Tulear was never feral on Madagascar. It did not hunt wild boar or alligators, as its size, strength, and demeanor can disprove easily. It was a companion dog of the Merina (the ruling tribe) in Madagascar. It has very little prey drive and is not a hunting dog.\n\nThe cottony coat may be the result of a single gene mutation. This small, friendly dog caught the fancy of the Malagasy royalty and they were the only people allowed to keep Cotons. When Dr. Robert Jay Russell discovered the breed in Madagascar in 1973 and brought the first ones to America, he coined the phrase the Royal Dog of Madagascar and the name stuck. They were also imported occasionally into France by returning French colonists, but were not officially imported to Europe until the 1970s.  In 1974, Madagascar released a stamp with the image of the Coton, affirming their status nation's \"royal dog\".\nThe Coton de Tulear was first formally recognised as a breed by the Societe Centrale Canine (the French national kennel club) in 1970 and was accepted by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, which published the breed standard in 1972. The Coton de Tul\u00e9ar is recognised internationally through the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale and by major kennel clubs (The Kennel Club (UK) in the Toy Group, and the United Kennel Club (US) in the Companion Group), using standards based upon the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale standard. The breed is not recognised by the New Zealand Kennel Club or the Australian Kennel Union. It also may be recognised in the English-speaking world by any of the very large number of minor registries, clubs, and internet-based dog registry businesses.\nIn the United States, another standard for the Coton de Tulear was developed based upon the breed in Madagascar in 1974 by a biologist, Dr. Robert Jay Russell. Russell established the Coton de Tulear Club of America in 1976 and was opposed to American Kennel Club recognition. The Coton de Tulear entered the American Kennel Club Foundation Stock Service (their first step in breed recognition) in 1996, and became a fully recognized breed on July 1st, 2014. The American Kennel Club Parent Club for the breed is the United States of America Coton de Tulear Club.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBichon\nRare breed (dog)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCoton de Tulear at Curlie"}, {"id": 155, "name": "Cretan Hound", "country": "Greece", "type": "", "picture": "dog155", "description": "The Kritikos Lagonikos (Cretan Hound) (Greek:K\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u039b\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2) is a hunting breed of dog from the island of Crete, in Greece. It is considered \nto be one of the oldest hunting breeds in Europe, with a history that goes back to 4,000 years ago.\nThis is a multi-talented dog that comes directly from Crete. Its excellent scent, speed, agility, and durability make it an exceptional hare hunter. Cretan Hounds also have guarding instincts as well as pastoral instincts.\nThe Cretan Hound is nationally recognized both in Greece and in Germany.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Cretan Hound is a slender dog, somewhere in the middle between a scenthound and a sighthound in body, particularly light on its feet (that are oval rather than cat-like) and strong in loin, specially adopted for swift reflexes and high speed over dangerous, rocky terrain. The head is wedge-shaped, elongated and dry, with pricked and very mobile ears that fold backwards like a greyhound\u2019s during the chase. The tail is a most important breed characteristic: long and curved upwards, forming a loose or tight ring and covered with a brush of longer hair underneath.\nThe dog is slightly longer than tall, with medium angulations, slender legs and good muscle; the ribcage is spacious but neither too broad nor too rounded and it does not quite reach the point of elbow. The loin is slender yet powerful and there is good tuck-up, with the points of the hipbones slightly prominent. There should be a balance between characteristics of speed and stamina, the conformation being a compromise producing great agility. Flabby, clumsy, heavy individuals not to be tolerated.\nThe colors of this breed can range from: pure white, cream, sandy, fawn, grey, black or brindle, bi-colored or tri-colored.\nSizes:\nMales: 27 inches or more (60+cm)\nFemales: 19+ inches (50+ cm)\nWeight for both males and females can be between 44-66 pounds (20\u201330 kg).\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Cretan Hound uses both sight and scent on the hunt and they have a particular tendency to taste the aerial or ground scent, even to the point of sucking it from pebbles and stones. When the prey is sensed, the tail moves in circular fashion and the hound becomes rigid, moments before the chase begins. Meek, affectionate, aristocratic, yet deadly on the chase, it\u2019s a polite hound that comes alive in the presence of prey; clean, gentle, elegant in form and movement, very intelligent, it\u2019s never vulgar or overwhelming in gestures. \nSlightly reserved with strangers, it\u2019s naturally inquisitive and tolerant. The Cretan Hound lives happily together with other domestic animals but will ruthlessly chase the neighbor\u2019s cat! Excellent, gentle and very affectionate with children. It rarely barks but will give notice of strangers approaching its home; at the farm it will kill mice and rats and it\u2019s not indifferent to feathered game, but the latter use will make the breed lazy and untidy in the hunt; its constitution needs the challenge of the true chase.\n\n\n== History ==\nA primitive hunting breed, its existence on the Greek island of Crete is documented in writing and artifacts for at least 3500 years. It was extensively cultivated and used by the Minoan civilization which, at its peak, dominated over most part of the Aegean, the Cyclades islands and eastern Peloponesus. A tracking and coursing hound, it was always used in chasing and catching hare and wild rabbits on the harsh terrains of its native island. The classic authors praised the Cretan hounds (Kressai Kynes) as the best hare-hunters known to man and in ancient times they were exported to the Greek colonies and other countries in Europe, reaching as far as Spain and the British islands, to mix and improve the local hounds. The dogs have many such peculiar traits and they are evidently a truly ancient species, probably the oldest dog breed in Europe. It is possible that their ancestors came from Africa but they were subsequently adapted to this unique habitat of Crete, an island remote enough to host other unique species of animals also, such as a unique sub-species of wild goat, lynx and others. Isolated there for millennia, these dogs were formed by function to perform a particular and challenging task and they remained pure and unchanged to this day. Due to a long history of struggle against outside enemies, the Cretan people are a freedom-loving race, proud, independent, somewhat suspicious and even stubborn. They do not like to give their dogs to outsiders and even to this day the best specimens are kept hidden from the public eye. Breeding practices are ruthless and the limited means of the past taught the locals to neuter all but the best males and destroy the dogs that were lagging in the hunt. This resulted in a particularly strong and healthy breed, but also one very small in numbers. For years they were kept secret and even now they rarely leave Crete, apart from on the rare occasions they take part in International dog shows held in Athens, where visitors have the opportunity to meet a true living legend.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlopekis\nGreek Harehound\nGreek Shepherd\nKokoni Domestic Dog\nList of dog breeds\nKennel Club of Greece\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\n=== English ===\nThe Cretan Hound, Rarest of All\n\"The Hound of Crete\" in Shakespeare\n\n\n=== Greek ===\nCretan Hound, Kennel Club of Greece, Breed Standard (in Greek)\nwww.kritikosichnilatis.gr\nCretan Hound an Ancient Breed\n\n\n=== German ===\nkretahund\n\n\n== References ==\n\nMETAMORPHOSES by OVID: Book III:206-231 Actaeon is pursued by his hounds\nCYNEGETICUS by Xenophon: Chapter X\n\"Cretan tracer hound - dog breed in Crete\". issue #50.

They are of low to medium height and the base color is always black, although there may be very small patches of white on its chest and/or toes.\nA characteristic is the short hairs on its somewhat fox-like head and legs. The remainder of the coat is longer and wavy or curly.\nThe height at the withers in both sexes is between 16 and 21 inches and the length exceeds the height by approximately 10%.  Nowadays, some dogs are even taller; that is probably due to better nutrition and an easier life - they grow to their full genetic potential. Traditionally the tail is docked very short but, if undocked, it is carried curled over the dog's back.\n\nHeadGenerally: The head is relatively light, lean and wedge shaped. The ratio between the muzzle and the skull is 9 : 11. The total length of the head is about 20 cm.\nSkull: Slightly rounded skull tapering towards the nose. The eyebrow arches are not pronounced. The cheeks are rounded. The occiput can be distinct.\nStop: Slightly pronounced.FaceNose: Always black and in the line with the nose ridge.\nMuzzle: Lean, nose ridge looking from the profile is straight and is a wedge-shaped extension of the skull. The lower jaw is well developed and forms a harmonious whole with the line of the nose ridge. The muzzle is neither pointed nor square.\nTeeth: Well developed with a complete scissors bite. Level bite is acceptable but not desirable.\nLips: Dry, close fitting and supple. The visible lip pigment is black. Corner of the mouth is tight.\nEyes: Chestnut brown to black, medium in size, almond-shaped, and set horizontally, they give the dog a lively expression. The rims of the eyelids are dark pigmented and tight, fit close to the eyeballs.\nEars: Triangular in shape, medium-sized, erect or semi-erect, somewhat set to the side. Erect ears are more desirable. Ear cropping is not allowed.\nNECK: Slightly rises above the back line, the upper and lower lines of the neck are straight. Moderately long, it is of medium strength, deep and well rounded, muscular. The skin is without dewlap and is covered with a dense coat.BodyWithers: Not pronounced. The transition to the neck is gradual.\nBack: Straight, short and muscular.\nLoin: Short and firmly coupled.\nChest: Medium long, broad and deep enough. Ribs well sprung, forechest slightly pronounced. The transition to the neck is in a straight line.\nBelly: Slightly tucked-up. The loins are full and sturdy.\nCroup: Medium long, slightly sloping down, muscular and fairly broad.TailSet medium high, with thick long hair, in repose it hangs relaxed or is carried at back level. In attention it is carried above the back line. Some dogs are born tailless or with a short tail, or the tail is docked so that in an adult male it is about 4 cm long. However, tail docking is now banned in Croatia.LimbsForequarters: The legs are straight, parallel and of medium length. Angulation of the front legs is more opened, the dog stands steeper. Shoulder blades are medium long and muscular, somewhat set steeper. The upper arm is relatively short. The forearm is long and muscular. Bones are lighter.\nPasterns dry, indistinct, short and not completely vertical. The feet are small, strong, semi-rabbit-like. The toes are well knitted, well and firmly cushioned. The nails are black or gray.\nHindquarters: The hind legs are medium-angulated. From behind, the legs are parallel. The lower thigh is long and the hock is set lower. The upper thigh is of medium width, well muscled. The hocks are dry and distinct, well angulated.\nHind feet are the same as the front ones, small and sturdy though somewhat elongated. Dewclaws are removed.\nGait/Movement: The Croatian Sheepdog moves in briskly trot with moderately long steps.CoatTexture: The length of hair on the back is between 7 and 14 cm. The foreface is always shorthaired. The ears are shorthaired on the outside and longhaired on the inside. The backside of the forelegs has longer hairs down to pastern and forms feathering. The hind legs have pronounced feathering from the buttocks to the hocks. The coat is relatively soft, wavy to curly, but must not be woolly. The undercoat must be dense.\nColour: The base color of the coat is black. A few white hairs can be tolerated. White markings on the head, body and tail are not permissible, but small white markings are permissible on the throat and the forechest. White markings on the toes or the legs are permissible but undesirable. White legs up to pasterns lower the dog's marks on shows.Height & WeightThe height at withers in males and females is between 40 and 50 cm.\nHeight: 16-21 inches (40\u201353 cm.)\nWeight: 29-43 pounds (13\u201320 kg.)\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe Croatian Sheepdog is an alert, agile, keen and intelligent dog with enormous energy and with a strong need for human companionship.  It is healthy, resistant to disease and not expensive to keep.  It possesses a well-developed herding instinct and is an excellent watchdog.\nIt's a caring and modest shepherd's dog, very loyal to their master.\nThe breed also possesses an hereditary predisposition for working cattle. Some farmers affirm that their Croatian Sheepdog knows and will single out every head of cattle by hearing its name.\nIn the past, the dog was often used to drive herds of pigs to oak woods in autumn, and, in one old document, it states that this versatile breed even herded the horses from \u0110akovo's stables.\nIt is both a driving and a gathering dog and, depending on whether it comes from a show or working line, its desire to work stock varies. Its approach to the flock may be closer and harder than some other breeds, but is very effective. It may grip but seldom causes any damage thereby. Nevertheless, it requires firm but sensitive handling and it is easy to overcome these aggressive tendencies by training. The breed is very intense and may bark a lot during the early stages of training, but, with experience, it will usually only bark at the right time - mostly when working in yards. This dog usually obeys only one person and an older sheepdog may take some time to switch allegiance to a new master. If not socialized early, it can be wary of strangers.\nThe Croatian Sheepdog responds well to obedience training but as a pet without any work it can become very noisy, even destructive. It is, however, a very docile breed and comprehends quickly what is expected of it, which it accomplishes with pleasure. At around 3 or 4 months the pup is usually taken to the flock. In most cases, these pups are worked beside an older dog, and the pup learns its job and at around 6 months is useful for work.\nIt is always behind its master's heels, waiting for the next move and often looks into its master's eyes as it asks \"What next?\"\nNowadays, fewer and fewer Croatian Sheepdogs earn their keep by working with stock in native Slavonia, because many open plains are put to crops and stock is kept indoors.\nCroatian Sheepdogs do well in an apartment as long as they get enough regular exercise.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe Croatian Sheepdog is a very good breed for dog sports. They can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Croatian Sheepdogs exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== Care ==\nCroatian sheepdogs are usually very healthy. This breed is easy to groom: an occasional combing or brushing to remove dead hair and a bath if dirty is all it needs. This breed is an average shedder.\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to written documents, the appearance of this breed has not changed greatly from the 14th century to the present day. Probably because it possesses an excellent hereditary instinct for working sheep and cattle, selection on the basis of usability was being carried out spontaneously, which has resulted also in the balance of its look.\nThe earliest written document about Croatian Sheepdogs, named \"Canis pastoralis croaticus\", found in the archives of the diocese of \u0110akovo by the \"father of the breed\"\u2014veterinarian Stjepan Romi\u0107\u2014is from 1374.  In this document, Petar, Bishop of \u0110akovo, says \"the dog is about 18 inches high, with medium long black curly coat, the hair on the head is short, ears are pricked or semi-pricked and it is very good for keeping flocks of all farm animals.\"\nHe also mentions that the Croats brought the dog with them while migrating from their original native land to Croatia in the 7th century. Romi\u0107 also found in archive of \u0110akovo's diocese important information from Years 1719, 1737, 1742 and 1752.\nIn all of these documents the description of the Croatian Sheepdog matches entirely its appearance today and in all of them the dog is named Canis pastoralis croaticus or Croatian Sheepdog.\nA systematic selection breeding program was started by Romi\u0107 in 1935 with dogs in the territory of \u0110akovo. After 34 years of work, the breed was finally recognized by FCI in 1969.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Croatian Shepherd Dog\" (PDF). FCI. 27 May 2015.

It worked quietly, quickly and low-to-ground. The head was rather broad and flat, tapering to a medium-length muzzle.  The ears fell over to the front or were semi-erect and rather small. The body was fairly long and extremely lithe, with light but muscular legs and a low-set tail carried at the trail. The coat was fairly heavy and quite dense.

It is the tallest of the retrievers and is easily distinguishable by the mass of tight curls covering its body. Curly Coated and Wavy Coated (now known as the Flat-Coated Retriever) were the first two recognised retriever breeds, established as early as 1860.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Curly is an active, well-muscled dog bred for upland bird and waterfowl hunting. The Curly is somewhat different in structure than the more common retrievers. A well-bred Curly will appear slightly leggy but is actually slightly longer than tall. It is balanced and agile with a significant air of endurance, strength, and grace. Curlies are soft-mouthed and regularly handle game with care. Show standards call for dogs to be between 25 and 27 inches (64 and 69 cm) at the withers, and for females to be between 23 and 25 inches (58 and 64 cm), however a wide range of sizes occurs, particularly in those dogs bred for the field, which generally run smaller. The country of origin calls for a taller dog and bitch, with only 27 inches (69 cm) for males and 25 inches (64 cm) for females listed. Taller is preferable to shorter. Weight should be in proportion to the height of the dog.\nThe breed sports a coat of tight, crisp curls. The tight curled coat of the Curly repels water, burrs, and prevents damage that other sporting dogs with softer, thinner coats cannot escape. The only acceptable colours for the Curly Coated Retriever are solid black and solid liver. Occasional white hairs are permissible, but white patches are a serious fault. Eyes should be either black or brown in black dogs, and brown or amber in liver dogs. Yellow eyes are unusual. The nose should be fully pigmented, and the same colour as the coat as the dog.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Curly Coated Retriever was originally developed as a gun dog and their temperament and conformation reflect this purpose. Curlies are still used in many countries as bird hunting companions, including in both upland and waterfowl hunting. Like most retrievers, they are valued as pets and are a lively and fun-loving breed. As long as the Curly has enough exercise, it can be calm and laid back in the home environment, which makes them both a great activity dog as well as a placid member of the family.\nThe Curly can be sometimes aloof with strangers but are usually very loyal and affectionate with their owners and family. Curlies are extremely intelligent in general, but training can sometimes be difficult as they can easily get bored with repetitive training. They rank 41st in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of average working/obedience intelligence.\n\n\n== Care and maintenance ==\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nCurlies are a single coated breed with no undercoat, and the small tight curls of a show-standard dog are very easy to maintain. A Curly kept as a companion and/or hunting animal need not be elaborately groomed but needs to be kept clean and free of mats for the health of the dog. All Curlies shed though not to the degree that dogs with undercoats do. Bitches usually shed more heavily during their heat cycles (usually twice a year). Dogs and bitches may also shed more in the spring, especially those living in areas with extreme seasonal temperature changes. Bathing should be as needed using a dog shampoo.\nShow ring exhibitors normally trim feathering from the tail, ears, belly, legs, and feet. Trimming is not required when exhibiting a Curly at a conformation dog show, but most judges may discount the dog if it is not trimmed. Shaving of the body coat is undesirable.Colors only come in solid liver & black.\n\n\n=== Exercise ===\nThe Curly-Coated Retriever likes exercise; it was bred for athleticism and endurance in the field.  A Curly is an intelligent dog and is happiest when it has adequate exercise, mental stimulation and play. Curlies are great dogs for active sports such as hunt tests, flyball and dog agility trials as they love the outdoors, working with people, and activities of any kind. While active and exuberant outside, at play, or in the field, the adult Curly is generally a calm house dog. According to the International Encyclopedia of Dogs (1984), \"this dog's delight is swimming\", which has made it a valuable retriever especially where streams and rivers have to be crossed.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n=== Life expectancy ===\nAverage life expectancy is 9\u201314 years, although there are instances of Curlies living to 15 to 17 years of age..\n\n\n=== Known medical issues ===\nCancer\nCardiac problems\nEpilepsy\nExercise-induced collapse (EIC)\nEye problems such as cataracts, corneal dystrophy, distichiasis, entropion, ectropion, or retinal dysplasia\nGastric dilatation volvulus (bloat)\nGlycogen storage disease (GSD)\nHip dysplasia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCurly-coated Retriever at Curlie"}, {"id": 159, "name": "Cursinu", "country": "Corsica, France", "type": "", "picture": "dog159", "description": "The Cursinu, is a breed of dog originating from Corsica. It has existed on the island since the 16th century, but went into decline during the late 20th century; however it was saved and became recognized by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine. Used for a variety of working purposes, it has no specific health issues.\n\n\n== History ==\nCursinus have been known on Corsica since the 16th century. Until the 1950s, the breed was used as a versatile hunting and farming dog on the island. During the second half of the 20th century the breed suffered due to competition from continental breeds. In 1989 the L'association de Sauvegarde du Chien Corse was set up to safeguard the breed.The breed has been recognised by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine, the French kennel club, since 2003; it is placed in the spitz and primitive group breeds, as a primitive  breed.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe breed measures 46\u201358 centimetres (18\u201323 in) at the withers with male dogs being slightly larger than females. Their coat can be fringed, with usual colors being fawn, black and tan or brown. The presence of a melanistic mask is permitted under the breed standard. White markings can be on the chest or the legs. The skin of the dog adheres closely to the body, and dewlaps do not appear in the breed.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Cursinu is docile, loyal and very attached to its owner. It is wary of strangers. It's an intelligent, calm and stable dog capable of adapting itself to many situations. Calm at home, it explodes with energy and speed when in action.\n\n\n=== Use ===\nIt is a versatile breed, having been used as a sheepdog, as well as to herd cattle and in some instances for dog fighting. In hunting it is most often used in hunting Wild boar, but has been used for fox and hare. It is still used as a herding dog, a watchdog and for companionship. It can require further training than some other breeds, but can become a pleasant companion to its owner.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThere are no breed specific health issues.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nGuy Bedos, a French actor and comedian, owned a Cursinu named Malo.\nIn the French film The Corsican File, the detective Jack Palmer goes to a bar where he sees a female Cursinu, that he mistakes for a mutt.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 160, "name": "Czechoslovakian Wolfdog", "country": "Czechoslovakia", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog160", "description": "The Czechoslovakian Wolfdog (Czech: \u010ceskoslovensk\u00fd vl\u010d\u00e1k, Slovak: \u010ceskoslovensk\u00fd vl\u010diak) is a relatively new dog breed that traces its original lineage to an experiment conducted in 1955 in Czechoslovakia. After initially breeding working line German Shepherd Dogs with Carpathian wolves (Canis lupus lupus), a plan was worked out to create a breed that would have the temperament, pack mentality, and trainability of the German Shepherd Dog and the strength, physical build and stamina of the Carpathian wolf.\nThe breed was engineered as attack dogs for use in military special operations done by the Czechoslovak special forces commandos but were later also used in search and rescue, schutzhund, tracking, herding, agility, obedience, hunting and drafting in Europe and the United States. It was officially recognized as a national breed in Czechoslovakia in 1982, and was officially recognised as a breed by F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) in 1989.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1955 Ing. Karel Hartl began to consider crossing a Carpathian wolf with a German Shepherd as a scientific experiment at the military kennels in Czechoslovakia. A few years later, however, the idea was born to establish a new breed. The first hybrids of a female wolf named Brita and a male German Shepherd named C\u00e9zar were born on 26 May 1958 in Lib\u011bjovice.\nPuppies of the first generation resembled the wolf in appearance and behavior. Their upbringing was difficult; training was possible, but the results hardly matched the effort. In adulthood, they were again bred with German Shepherds, decreasing the proportion of \"wolf blood\" to 6.25% in the fourth generation. Most individuals of the third and fourth generations were able to attend a normal course and could be placed in a service performance. Compared to dogs they had better navigational skills, night vision, hearing, and sense of smell. In tests of endurance, hybrids finished the entire 100 km route without being exhausted.\nThe lecture of Ing. Karel Hartl, \"Results of crossing wolves with dogs\", brought major attention at the World Dog Show held in June 1965 in Brno and in Prague at the annual meeting of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) and the International Cynologic Congress. In the following year Ing. Hartl compiled a draft standard of a new dog breed. Mating of the wolf Brita with the German Shepherd Kurt then created the basis of a second line. A third line was made by joining the wolf Argo with the female German Shepherd dog Asta from the SNB. However, the breed-in-foundation was repeatedly refused recognition, and in the early 1970s, most breeding dogs were moved to the Slovakian military kennels at Malacky under the supervision of Vice-commander Major Frantisek Rosik.  From 1971-1981, there would only be litters whelped in Slovakia.\nIn 1977, a 3rd-generation hybrid female named Xela of the border guards was covered by the wolf Sarika; he also mated with the female Urta of the border guards. The last addition of wolf blood took place in 1983. The wolf Lejdy of Ohrada Zoo in Hlubok\u00e1 nad Vltavou gave birth to last line of the new breed, the father of the puppies being the German Shepherd Bojar von Shottenhof. Since that time, breeding has been carried out only in closed populations and the developed breed referred to as Czechoslovakian Wolfdogs.\nIn 1982 the breed was again presented for recognition by Frantisek Rosik through the Klubu chovate\u013eov \u010csV (Club of Breeders of Czechoslovakian Wolfdog - current day Slovakian Breed Club), and this time, it was recognized by the Czechoslovakian breeders associations as a national breed. In 1989, it became provisionally recognized as FCI standard no. 332, group 1, section 1. It won the title of \"World Champion\" at the World Dog Show in Brno in 1990. Ten years later, in 1999, the breed confirmed its viability and met all the criteria of the FCI, earning full recognition of the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog breed.\nIn 2012, the breed numbered 168 adult females and 170 adult males officially registered in the Czech Republic. As of January 2014, the most puppies each year are registered in Italy (up to two hundred), in the Czech Republic (about 100), and in Slovakia (about 50). . The breed is growing in popularity in the UK too, with a number of Czechoslovakian Wolfdogs working in Search and Rescue  , supported by a dedicated Breed Club. \n\n\n== 2017 Italian Ave Lupo operation ==\nIn January 2017, 229 Czechoslovakian Wolfdogs were sequestered by the Environmental Protection Unit of the Carabinieri following a nationwide investigation. The investigation started in 2013 and it was taken over in 54 Italian provinces and was stating that Italian breeders were crossing the Czechoslovakian dog-wolves with wild wolves from the Carpathian Mountains, Scandinavia and even from North America. Following this crossing, the newborns were considered to have a stronger bone structure and a more similar aspect to the wild wolves, allowing the same breeders to improve their performances at expositions. Because of this, puppies were sold on an average price of \u20ac5,000. The operation was part of a major international operation that was investigating the illegal traffic of wild wolves in different European countries.\n\n\n== DNA analysis ==\nIn 2015, a DNA study of the breed compared to German Shepherds and Carpathian wolves found only two maternal mitochondrial DNA haplotypes and two paternal Y DNA haplotypes within the breed. Both mDNA haplotypes and one yDNA haplotype originated with German Shepherds and was the result of back-crossing. The other yDNA haplotype was unique to the breed. All four haplotypes were distinct from those of the parental populations.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nBoth the build and the haircoat of the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog are reminiscent of a wolf. The lowest shoulder height is 65 cm (26 in) for a male and 60 cm (24 in) for a female, and there is no upper limit. The body frame is rectangular, with the ratio of the height to length being 9:10 or less. The minimum weight is 26 kg (57 lb) for males and 20 kg (44 lb) for females.  The expression of the head must indicate the sex. Amber eyes set obliquely and short upright ears in a triangular shape are its characteristic features. The set of teeth is complete (42) and very strong; both scissors-shaped and pliers-shaped dentition are acceptable. The spine is straight, strong in movement, with a short loin. The chest is large and flat rather than barrel-shaped. The belly is strong and drawn in. The back is short and slightly sloped; the tail is high set, and when freely lowered reaches the tarsi. The forelimbs are straight and narrow-set, with the paws slightly turned out, with a long radius and metacarpus. The hind limbs are muscular, with a long calf and instep.\nThe coat color is yellow-grey to silver-grey, with a light mask. The hair is straight, close, and very thick. The Czechoslovakian Wolfdog is a typical tenacious canterer; its movement is light and harmonious, and its stride is long.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Czechoslovakian Wolfdog is more versatile than specialized. It is considered to be a handful. Distinct from the character of the Saarloos Wolfhound, shyness is a disqualifying fault in the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog.\nThe Czechoslovakian Wolfdog develops a very strong social relationship -- not only with its owner, but with the whole family. It can easily learn to live with other domestic animals that belong to the family; however, difficulties can occur in encounters with strange animals. It is vital to subdue the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog's passion for hunting when it is a puppy to avoid aggressive behavior towards smaller animals as an adult. The puppy should never be isolated in the kennel; it must be socialized and get used to different surroundings. Female Czechoslovakian Wolfdogs tend to be more easily controllable, but both sexes often experience a stormy adolescence.\nThe Czechoslovakian Wolfdog is very playful, temperamental, and learns easily. However, it does not train spontaneously, the behavior of the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog is strictly purposeful -- it is necessary to find motivation for training. The most frequent cause of failure is usually the fact that the dog is tired out with long useless repetitions of the same exercise, which results in the loss of motivation. These dogs have admirable senses and are very good at following trails. They are very independent and can cooperate in the pack with a special purposefulness. If required, they can easily shift their activity to the night hours. Sometimes problems can occur during their training when barking is required. Czechoslovakian Wolfdogs have a much wider range of means of expressing themselves and barking is unnatural for them; they try to communicate with their masters in other ways (mainly through body language, but also with quiet noises such as growls, grunts, and whining). Generally, teaching the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog stable and reliable performance takes a bit longer than teaching traditional specialized breeds. The Czechoslovakian Wolfdog has been successfully employed as a Search And Rescue (SAR) dog in Italy, although, admittedly, handling one requires much more work than other breeds.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSaarloos wolfdog\nTamaskan Dog\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCzechoslovakian Wolfdog at Curlie"}, {"id": 161, "name": "Dachshund", "country": "Germany", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog161", "description": "The dachshund (UK: /\u02c8daksh\u028and/ or US:  DAHKS-huunt  or ) (English: badger dog; also known as the sausage dog or wiener dog) is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed.\nThe standard size dachshund was developed to scent, chase, and flush out badgers and other burrow-dwelling animals, while the miniature dachshund was bred to hunt smaller prey such as rabbits. In the United States, they have also been used to track wounded deer and hunt prairie dogs.\nDachshunds also participate in conformation shows, field trials and many other events organized through pure-bred dog organizations such as the American Kennel Club (AKC).

Dachshund may be mispronounced as \"dash-hound\" by some English speakers.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nWhile classified in the hound group or scent hound group in the United States and Great Britain, the breed actually has its own group in the countries which belong to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (World Canine Federation).  Many dachshunds, especially the wire-haired subtype, may exhibit behavior and appearance that are similar to that of the terrier group of dogs. An argument can be made for the scent (or hound) group classification because the breed was developed to use scent to trail and hunt animals, and probably descended from the Saint Hubert Hound like many modern scent hound breed such as bloodhounds and Basset Hounds; but with the persistent personality and love for digging that probably developed from the terrier, it can also be argued that they could belong in the terrier, or \"earth dog\", group.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nA typical dachshund is long-bodied and muscular with short stubby legs. Its front paws are disproportionately large, being paddle-shaped and particularly suitable for digging. Its skin is loose enough not to tear while tunneling in tight burrows to chase prey. The dachshund has a deep chest which provides appropriate lung capacity for stamina when hunting. Its snout is long. According to the AKC standards for the breed, \"scars from honorable wounds shall not be considered a fault\" because the dachshund is a hunting dog.\n\n\n==== Coat and color ====\n\nThere are three dachshund coat varieties: smooth coat (short hair), longhaired, and wirehaired. Longhaired dachshunds have a silky coat and short featherings on legs and ears. Wirehaired dachshunds are the least common coat variety in the United States (although it is the most common in Germany) and the most recent coat to appear in breeding standards.\nDachshunds have a wide variety of colors and patterns, the most common one being red. Their base coloration can be single-colored (either red or cream), tan pointed (black and tan, chocolate and tan, blue and tan, or isabella and tan), and in wirehaired dogs, a color referred to as wildboar. Patterns such as dapple (merle), sable, brindle and piebald also can occur on any of the base colors.  Dachshunds in the same litter may be born in different coat colors depending on the genetic makeup of the parents. The dominant color in the breed is red, followed by black and tan. Tan pointed dogs have tan (or cream) markings over the eyes, ears, paws, and tail.  The reds range from coppers to deep rusts, with or without somewhat common black hairs peppered along the back, face and ear edges, lending much character and an almost burnished appearance; this is referred to among breeders and enthusiasts as an \"overlay\" or \"sabling\". Sabling should not be confused with a more unusual coat color referred to as sable. At a distance, a sable dachshund looks somewhat like a black and tan dog.  Upon closer examination, however, one can observe that along the top of the dog's body, each hair is actually banded with red at the base near the skin transitioning to mostly black along the length of the strand. An additional striking coat marking is the brindle pattern. \"Brindle\" refers to dark stripes over a solid background\u2014usually red. If a dachshund is brindled on a dark coat and has tan points, it will have brindling on the tan points only. Even one single, lone stripe of brindle is a brindle. If a dachshund has one single spot of dapple, it is a dapple.\nThe Dachshund Club of America (DCA) and the American Kennel Club (AKC) consider both the piebald pattern and the double dapple (double merle) pattern to be nonstandard. However, both types continue to be shown and sometimes even win in the conformation ring.\nDogs that are double-dappled have the merle pattern of a dapple, but with distinct white patches that occur when the dapple gene expresses itself twice in the same area of the coat. The DCA excluded the wording \"double-dapple\" from the standard in 2007 and now strictly use the wording \"dapple\" as the double dapple gene is commonly responsible for blindness and deafness.\n\nThere are three types of dachshund, which can be classified by their coats: short-haired, called 'smooth'; long-haired; and wire-haired\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nExamples of different types of dapple patterning\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Size ====\nDachshunds come in three sizes: standard, miniature, and kaninchen (German for \"rabbit\"). Although the standard and miniature sizes are recognized almost universally, the rabbit size is not recognized by clubs in the United States and the United Kingdom. The rabbit size is recognized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (World Canine Federation) (FCI), which contain kennel clubs from 83 countries all over the world. An increasingly common size for family pets falls between the miniature and the standard size, frequently referred to as \"tweenies,\" not an official classification.A full-grown standard dachshund averages 16 lb (7.3 kg) to 32 lb (15 kg), while the miniature variety normally weighs less than 12 lb (5.4 kg). The kaninchen weighs 8 lb (3.6 kg) to 11 lb (5.0 kg). According to kennel club standards, the miniature (and kaninchen, where recognized) differs from the full-size only by size and weight, thus offspring from miniature parents must never weigh more than the miniature standard to be considered a miniature as well. While many kennel club size divisions use weight for classification, such as the American Kennel Club, other kennel club standards determine the difference between the miniature and standard by chest circumference; some kennel clubs, such as in Germany, even measure chest circumference in addition to height and weight.H. L. Mencken said that \"A dachshund is a half-dog high and a dog-and-a-half long,\" although they have been referred to as \"two dogs long\". This characteristic has led them to be quite a recognizable breed, and they are featured in many a joke and cartoon, particularly The Far Side by Gary Larson.\n\n\n==== Eye color ====\n\nLight-colored dachshunds can sport amber, light brown, or green eyes; however, kennel club standards state that the darker the eye color, the better.  Dapple and double dapple dachshunds can have multi coloured \u201cwall\u201deyes with fully blue, partially blue or patched irises due to the effect of the dapple gene on eye pigmentation expression.   \u201cWall\u201d eye is permissible according to DCA standards but undesirable by AKC standards.   Piebald-patterned dachshunds will never have blue in their eyes, unless the dapple pattern is present.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nDachshunds are playful, but as hunting dogs can be quite stubborn, and are known for their propensity for chasing small animals, birds, and tennis balls with great determination and ferocity. Many dachshunds are stubborn, making them a challenge to train.\nBeing the owner of dachshunds, to me a book on dog discipline becomes a volume of inspired humor.  Every sentence is a riot. Some day, if I ever get a chance, I shall write a book, or warning, on the character and temperament of the dachshund and why he can't be trained and shouldn't be. I would rather train a striped zebra to balance an Indian club than induce a dachshund to heed my slightest command. When I address Fred I never have to raise either my voice or my hopes. He even disobeys me when I instruct him in something he wants to do.\n\nDachshunds can be aggressive to strangers and other dogs. Despite this, they are rated in the intelligence of dogs as an average working dog with a persistent ability to follow trained commands 50% of the time or more. They rank 49th in Stanley Coren's Intelligence of Dogs, being of average working and obedience intelligence.\nThey can have a loud bark. Some bark quite a lot and may need training to stop, while others will not bark much at all. Dachshunds are known for their devotion and loyalty to their owners, though they can be standoffish towards strangers.  If left alone too frequently, some dachshunds are prone to separation anxiety and may chew objects in the house to relieve stress.\nDachshunds are burrowers by nature and are likely to burrow in blankets and other items around the house, when bored or tired.\n\nDachshunds can be difficult to housebreak, and patience and consistency is often needed in this endeavor.\n\nAccording to the American Kennel Club's breed standards, \"the dachshund is clever, lively and courageous to the point of rashness, persevering in above and below ground work, with all the senses well-developed. Any display of shyness is a serious fault.\" Their temperament and body language give the impression that they do not know or care about their relatively small size. Like many small hunting dogs, they will challenge a larger dog. Indulged dachshunds may become snappy or extremely obstinate.Many dachshunds do not like unfamiliar people, and many will growl or bark at them. Although the dachshund is generally an energetic dog, some are sedate. This dog's behavior is such that it is not the dog for everyone. A bored, untrained dachshund will become destructive. If raised improperly and not socialized at a young age, dachshunds can become aggressive or fearful. They require a caring, loving owner who understands their need for entertainment and exercise.\nDachshunds may not be the best pets for small children. Like any dog, dachshunds need a proper introduction at a young age. Well trained dachshunds and well-behaved children usually get along fine. Otherwise, they may be aggressive and bite an unfamiliar child, especially one that moves quickly around them or teases them. However, many dachshunds are very tolerant and loyal to children within their family, but these children should be mindful of the vulnerability of the breed's back.\nA 2008 University of Pennsylvania study of 6,000 dog owners who were interviewed indicated that dogs of smaller breeds were more likely to be \"genetically predisposed towards aggressive behaviour\". Dachshunds were rated the most aggressive, with 20% having bitten strangers, as well as high rates of attacks on other dogs and their owners. The study noted that attacks by small dogs were unlikely to cause serious injuries and because of this were probably under-reported.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThe breed is prone to spinal problems, especially intervertebral disk disease (IVDD), due in part to an extremely long spinal column and short rib cage. The risk of injury may be worsened by obesity, jumping, rough handling, or intense exercise, which place greater strain on the vertebrae. About 20\u201325% of dachshunds will develop IVDD.Treatment consists of combinations of crate confinement and courses of anti-inflammatory medications (steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like carprofen and meloxicam), or chronic pain medications, like tramadol. Serious cases may require surgery to remove the troublesome disk contents. A dog may need the aid of a cart to get around if paralysis occurs.\nA minimally invasive procedure called \"percutaneous laser disk ablation\" has been developed at the Oklahoma State University Veterinary Hospital. Originally, the procedure was used in clinical trials only on dachshunds that had suffered previous back incidents. Since dachshunds are prone to back issues, the goal is to expand this treatment to dogs in a normal population.\nIn addition to back problems, the breed is prone to patellar luxation where the kneecap can become dislodged. Dachshunds may also be affected by Osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease). The condition seems to be mainly limited to wire-haired Dachshunds, with 17% being carriers. A genetic test is available to allow breeders to avoid breeding carriers to carriers. In such pairings, each puppy will have a 25% chance of being affected.In some double dapples, there are varying degrees of vision and hearing loss, including reduced or absent eyes. Not all double dapples have problems with their eyes and/or ears, which may include degrees of hearing loss, full deafness, malformed ears, congenital eye defects, reduced or absent eyes, partial or full blindness, or varying degrees of both vision and hearing problems; but heightened problems can occur due to the genetic process in which two dapple genes cross, particularly in certain breeding lines. Dapple genes, which are dominant genes, are considered \"dilution\" genes, meaning whatever color the dog would have originally carried is lightened, or diluted, randomly; two dominant \"dilution\" genes can cancel each other out, or \"cross\", removing all color and producing a white recessive gene, essentially a white mutation. When occurring genetically within the eyes or ears, this white mutation can be detrimental to development, causing hearing or vision problems.\nOther dachshund health problems include hereditary epilepsy, granulomatous meningoencephalitis, dental issues, Cushing's syndrome, thyroid and autoimmune problems, various allergies and atopies, and various eye conditions including cataracts, glaucoma, progressive retinal atrophy, corneal ulcers, nonucerative corneal disease, sudden acquired retinal degeneration, and cherry eye. Dachshunds are also 2.5 times more likely than other breeds of dogs to develop patent ductus arteriosus, a congenital heart defect. Dilute color dogs (Blue, Isabella, and Cream) are very susceptible to Color Dilution Alopecia, a skin disorder that can result in hair loss and extreme sensitivity to sun. Since the occurrence and severity of these health problems is largely hereditary, breeders are working to eliminate these.\n\n\n=== Inbreeding depression ===\nFactors influencing the litter size of puppies and the proportion of stillborn puppies per litter were analyzed in normally sized German dachshunds.   The records analyzed contained data on 42,855 litters.  It was found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating inbreeding depression.  It was also found that young and older dams had smaller litter sizes and more stillborn puppies than middle-aged dams.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSome writers and dachshund experts have theorized that the early roots of the dachshund go back to ancient Egypt, where engravings were made featuring short-legged hunting dogs. Recent discoveries by the American University in Cairo of mummified dachshund-like dogs from ancient Egyptian burial urns may lend credibility to this theory. In its modern incarnation, the dachshund is a creation of German breeders and includes elements of German, French, and English hounds and terriers. Dachshunds have been kept by royal courts all over Europe, including that of Queen Victoria, who was particularly enamored of the breed.The first verifiable references to the dachshund, originally named the \"Dachs Kriecher\" (\"badger crawler\") or \"Dachs Krieger\" (\"badger warrior\"), came from books written in the early 18th century. Prior to that, there exist references to \"badger dogs\" and \"hole dogs\", but these likely refer to purposes rather than to specific breeds. The original German dachshunds were larger than the modern full-size variety, weighing between 14 and 18 kg (31 and 40 lb), and originally came in straight-legged and crook-legged varieties (the modern dachshund is descended from the latter). Though the breed is famous for its use in exterminating badgers and badger-baiting, dachshunds were also commonly used for rabbit and fox hunting, for locating wounded deer, and in packs were known to hunt game as large as wild boar and as fierce as the wolverine.There are huge differences of opinion as to when dachshunds were specifically bred for their purpose of badger hunting, as the American Kennel Club states the dachshund was bred in the 15th century, while the Dachshund Club of America states that foresters bred the dogs in the 18th or 19th century.\nDouble-dapple dachshunds, which are prone to eye disease, blindness, or hearing problems, are generally believed to have been introduced to the United States between 1879 and 1885.The flap-down ears and famous curved tail of the dachshund have deliberately been bred into the dog. In the case of the ears, this is to keep grass seeds, dirt, and other matter from entering the ear canal. The curved tail is dual-purposed: to be seen more easily in long grass and, in the case of burrowing dachshunds, to help haul the dog out if it becomes stuck in a burrow.\nThe smooth-haired dachshund, the oldest style, may be a cross between the German Shorthaired Pointer, a Pinscher, and a Bracke (a type of bloodhound), or to have been produced by crossing a short Bruno Jura Hound with a pinscher. Others believe it was a cross from a miniature French pointer and a pinscher; others claim that it was developed from the St. Hubert Hound, also a bloodhound, in the 18th century, and still others believe that they were descended from Basset Hounds, based upon their scent abilities and general appearance. Daschshunds can track a scent that is more than a week old.The exact origins of the dachshund are therefore unknown. According to William Loeffler, from  The American Book of the Dog (1891), in the chapter on dachshunds: \"The origin of the Dachshund is in doubt, our best authorities disagreeing as to the beginning of the breed.\" What can be agreed on, however, is that the short-haired dachshund gave rise to both the long-haired and the wire-haired varieties.\nThere are two theories about how the standard longhair dachshund came about. One theory is that smooth Dachshunds would occasionally produce puppies which had slightly longer hair than their parents. By selectively breeding these animals, breeders eventually produced a dog which consistently produced longhair offspring, and the longhair dachshund was born. Another theory is that the standard longhair dachshund was developed by breeding smooth dachshunds with various land and water spaniels. The long-haired dachshund may be a cross among any of the small dog breeds in the spaniel group, including the German Stoeberhund, and the smooth-haired dachshund.The wire-haired dachshund, the last to develop, was bred in the late 19th century. There is a possibility the wire-haired dachshund was a cross between the smooth dachshund and various hard-coated terriers and wire-haired pinschers, such as the Schnauzer, the Dandie Dinmont Terrier, the German Wirehaired Pointer, or perhaps the Scottish Terrier.\n\n\n== Symbol of Germany ==\nDachshunds have traditionally been viewed as a symbol of Germany. Political cartoonists commonly used the image of the dachshund to ridicule Germany. During World War I the dachshunds' popularity in the United States plummeted because of this association. As a result, they were often called \"liberty hounds\" by their owners similar to \"liberty cabbage\" becoming a term for sauerkraut mostly in North America. The stigma of the association was revived to a lesser extent during World War II, though it was comparatively short-lived. Kaiser Wilhelm II and German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel were known for keeping dachshunds.\nDue to the association of the breed with Germany, as well as its particular popularity among dog keepers in Munich back then, the dachshund was chosen to be the first official mascot for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, with the name Waldi.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nSome people train and enter their dachshund to compete in dachshund races, such as the Wiener Nationals. Several races across the United States routinely draw several thousand attendees, including races in Germantown, Tennessee; Bossier City, Louisiana; Buda, Texas; Davis, California; Phoenix, Arizona; Los Alamitos, California; Findlay, Ohio; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Kansas City, Kansas; Palo Alto, California; Shakopee, Minnesota. There is also an annual dachshund run in Kennywood, located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, called the Wiener 100, in Huntington, West Virginia called the Dachshund Dash and in Lovettsville, Virginia as part of the town's annual Oktoberfest celebration.Despite the popularity of these events, the Dachshund Club of America opposes \"wiener racing\", as many greyhound tracks use the events to draw large crowds to their facilities. The DCA is also worried about potential injuries to dogs, due to their predisposition to back injuries. Another favorite sport is earthdog trials, in which dachshunds enter tunnels with dead ends and obstacles attempting to locate an artificial bait or live but caged and protected rats.\n\n\n== Dackel versus Teckel ==\nIn Germany, dachshunds are widely called Dackel (both singular and plural). Among hunters, they are mainly referred to as Teckel. There are kennels which specialize in breeding hunting dachshunds, the so-called jagdliche Leistungszucht (\"hunting-related performance breed\") or Gebrauchshundezucht (\"working dog breed\"), as opposed to breeding family dogs. Therefore, it is sometimes incorrectly believed that Teckel is either a name for the hunting breed or a mark for passing the test for a trained hunting dog (called \"VGP\", \"Verband-Gebrauchspr\u00fcfung\") in Germany.\n\n\n== Popularity ==\nDachshunds are one of the most popular dogs in the United States, ranking 13th in the 2016 AKC registration statistics. They are popular with urban and apartment dwellers, ranking among the top ten most popular breeds in 76 of 190 major US cities surveyed by the AKC.\nOne will find varying degrees of organized local dachshund clubs in most major American cities, including New York, New Orleans, Portland, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\n\n \nIn Art\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable dogs and owners ==\nJohn F.

Its roots trace back to Croatia and its historical region of Dalmatia. Today, it is a popular family pet and many dog enthusiasts enter Dalmatians into kennel club competitions.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Body ===\nThe Dalmatian is a medium sized, well-defined, muscular dog with excellent endurance and stamina.  When fully grown, according to the American Kennel Club breed standard, it stands from 19 to 23 inches (48 to 58 cm) tall, with males usually slightly larger than females.  Both the AKC and The Kennel Club in the UK allows height up to 24 inches (61 cm) but that isn't ideal. The outline of the dog should be square when viewed from the side: The body is as long from forechest to buttocks as it is tall at the withers, and the shoulders are well-laid back, the stifle is well-bent and the hocks are well-let down. The Dalmatian's feet are round with well-arched toes, and the nails are usually white or the same colour as the dog's spots. The thin ears taper towards the tip and are set fairly high and close to the head. Eye color varies between brown, amber, or blue, with some dogs having one blue eye and one brown eye, or other combinations.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nDalmatian puppies are born with plain white coats and their first spots usually appear within 3 to 4 weeks after birth, however spots are visible on their skin. After about a month, they have most of their spots, although they continue to develop throughout life at a much slower rate. Spots usually range in size from 30 to 60 mm, and are most commonly black or brown (liver) on a white background. Other, more rare colors, include blue (a blue-grayish color), brindle, mosaic, tricolor-ed (with tan spotting on the eyebrows, cheeks, legs, and chest), and orange or lemon (dark to pale yellow). Patches of color may appear anywhere on the body, mostly on the head or ears, and usually, consist of a solid color.  Patches are visible at birth and are not a group of connected spots and are identifiable by the smooth edge of the patch. The Dalmatian coat is usually short, fine, and dense; however, smooth-coated Dalmatians occasionally produce long-coated offspring.  Long-coated Dalmatians are not acceptable in the breed standard, however, these individuals experience much less shedding than their smooth-coated counterparts, which shed considerably year-round. The standard variety's short, stiff hairs often weave into carpet, clothing, upholstery and nearly any other kind of fabric and can be difficult to remove. Weekly grooming with a hound mitt or curry can lessen the amount of hair Dalmatians shed, although nothing can completely prevent shedding. Due to the minimal amount of oil in their coats, Dalmatians lack a dog odor (\"dog smell\") and stay fairly clean relative to many other dog breeds.\n\n\n=== Litter size ===\nDalmatians usually have litters of six to nine pups,  but they have been known to have larger litters on occasion, such as a massive eighteen puppy brood born in January 2009 (all were healthy). Puppies are born without spots, which develop and darken as the pup ages.\nPuppies don't have spots in the beginning\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nDalmatians are a relatively healthy and easy to keep breed. Like other breeds, Dalmatians display a propensity towards certain health problems specific to their breed, such as deafness, allergies and urinary stones. Reputable breeders have their puppies BAER (Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response) tested to ensure the status of the hearing on their pups. The Dalmatian Club of America lists the average lifespan of a Dalmatian at between 11 and 13 years, although some can live as long as 15 to 16 years. Breed health surveys in the US and the UK show an average lifespan of 9.9 and 11.55 years, respectively. In their late teens, both males and females may suffer bone spurs and arthritic conditions. Autoimmune thyroiditis may be a relatively common condition for the breed, affecting 11.6% of dogs.\n\n\n=== Deafness ===\nA genetic predisposition for deafness is a serious health problem for Dalmatians; only about 70% have normal hearing. Deafness was not recognized by early breeders, so the breed was thought to be unintelligent. Even after recognizing the problem as a genetic fault, breeders did not understand the dogs' nature, and deafness in Dalmatians continues to be a frequent problem.Researchers now know deafness in albino and piebald animals is caused by the absence of mature melanocytes in the inner ear. This may affect one or both ears. The condition is also common in other canine breeds that share a genetic propensity for light pigmentation. This includes, but is not limited to Bull Terriers, Dogo Argentinos, Poodles, Boxers, Border Collies and Great Danes.Typically, only dogs with bilateral hearing are bred, although those with unilateral hearing, and even dogs with bilateral deafness, make fine pets with appropriate training. The Dalmatian Club of America's position on deaf pups is that they should not be used for breeding, and that humane euthanasia may be considered as an \"alternative to placement\". Deaf Dalmatian puppies can be difficult to home, due to increased aggression and difficulty in managing behavior. Dalmatians with large patches of colour present at birth may have a lower rate of deafness.  Selecting for this trait may reduce the frequency of deafness in the breed. However, patches are a disqualifying factor in Dalmatian breed standards in an effort to preserve the spotted coat (the continual breeding of patched dogs would result in heavily patched Dalmatians with few spots).Blue-eyed Dalmatians are thought to have a greater incidence of deafness than brown-eyed Dalmatians, although a mechanism of association between the two characteristics has yet to be conclusively established. Some kennel clubs discourage the use of blue-eyed dogs in breeding programs.\n\n\n=== Hip dysplasia ===\nHip dysplasia is another disease that affects nearly 5% of purebred Dalmatians, causing those to experience limping, fatigue, moderate to severe pain, and trouble standing up. Most Dalmatians who eventually develop hip dysplasia are born with normal hips, but the soft tissues surrounding the joint grow abnormally due to their genetic make-up. The disease may affect both hips, or only the right or left hip, leading afflicted dogs to walk or run with an altered gait.\n\n\n=== Hyperuricemia ===\n\nDalmatians, like humans, can suffer from hyperuricemia. Dalmatians' livers have trouble breaking down uric acid, which can build up in the blood serum (hyperuricemia) causing gout. Uric acid can also be excreted in high concentration into the urine, causing kidney stones and bladder stones. These conditions are most likely to occur in middle-aged males. Males over 10 are prone to kidney stones and should have their calcium intake reduced or be given preventive medication. To reduce the risk of gout and stones, owners should carefully limit the intake of purines by avoiding giving their dogs food containing organ meats, animal byproducts, or other high-purine ingredients. Hyperuricemia in Dalmatians responds to treatment with orgotein, the veterinary formulation of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase.\n\n\n==== Dalmatian-Pointer Backcross Project ====\nHyperuricemia in Dalmatians (as in all breeds) is inherited, but unlike other breeds, the \"normal\" gene for uricase is not present in the breed's gene pool. Therefore, there is no possibility of eliminating hyperuricemia among pure-bred Dalmatians. The only possible solution to this problem must then be crossing Dalmatians with other breeds to reintroduce the \"normal\" uricase gene. This led to the foundation of the Dalmatian-Pointer Backcross Project, which aims to reintroduce the normal uricase gene into the Dalmatian breed. The backcross used a single English Pointer; subsequent breedings have all been to purebred Dalmatians. This project was started in 1973 by Dr. Robert Schaible. The first cross (F1) hybrids did not resemble Dalmatians very closely. The F1s were then crossed back to purebreds. This breeding produced puppies of closer resemblance to the pure Dalmatian. By the fifth generation in 1981, they resembled purebreds so much, Dr. Schaible convinced the AKC to allow two of the hybrids to be registered as purebreds. Then AKC President William F. Stifel stated, \"If there is a logical, scientific way to correct genetic health problems associated with certain breed traits and still preserve the integrity of the breed standard, it is incumbent upon the American Kennel Club to lead the way.\" The Dalmatian Club of America's (DCA) board of directors supported this decision, however it quickly became highly controversial among the club members. A vote by DCA members opposed the registration of the hybrids, causing the AKC to ban registration to any of the dog's offspring.At the annual general meeting of the DCA in May 2006, the backcross issue was discussed again by club members. In June of the same year, DCA members were presented with an opportunity to vote on whether to reopen discussion of the Dalmatian Backcross Project. The results of this ballot were nearly 2:1 in favor of re-examining support of the project by the DCA. This has begun with publication of articles presenting more information both in support of and questioning the need for this project. In July 2011, the AKC agreed to allow registration of backcrossed Dalmatians.In 2010, the UK Kennel Club registered a backcrossed Dalmatian called Ch. Fiacre\u2019s First and Foremost. Several restrictions were imposed on the dog. Although the dog is at least 13 generations removed from the original Pointer cross, its F1 to F3 progeny will be marked on registration certificates with asterisks (which \"indicate impure or unverified breeding\",) no progeny will be eligible to be exported as pedigrees for the next five years, and all have to be health tested. UK Dalmatian breed clubs have objected to the decision by the Kennel Club.\n\n\n==== The Dalmatian Heritage Project ====\nThe Dalmatian Heritage Project began in 2005.  The goal of the project is to preserve and improve the Dalmatian breed by breeding parent dogs with the following traits:\n\nNormal urinary metabolism\nBilateral hearing\nFriendly and confidentAll puppies in the Heritage Project are descendants of Dr. Robert Schaible's parent line.  Today, \"Dr. Schaible\u2019s line produces the only Dalmatians in the world today that are free of a metabolic defect that can lead to urinary tract problems.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe FCI recognized Croatia as its country of origin, citing several historical sources.The first illustrations of the dog have been found in Croatia: an altar painting in Veli Lo\u0161inj dating to 1600\u20131630, and a fresco in Zaostrog. The first documented descriptions of the Dalmatian (Croatian: Dalmatinski pas, Dalmatiner, Dalmatinac) trace back to the early 18th century and the archives of the Archdiocese of \u0110akovo, where the dog was mentioned and described as Canis Dalmaticus in the church chronicles from 1719 by Bishop Petar Baki\u0107 and then again by church chronicles of Andreas Keczkem\u00e9ty in 1739. In 1771, Thomas Pennant described the breed in his book Synopsis of Quadrupeds, writing that the origin of the breed is from Dalmatia, he referred to it as Dalmatian. The book by Thomas Bewick A General History of Quadrupeds published in 1790 refers to the breed as Dalmatian or Coach Dog.During the Regency period, the Dalmatian became a status symbol trotting alongside the horse-drawn carriages and those with decorative spotting were highly prized. For this reason, the breed earned the epithet 'the Spotted Coach Dog.' The breed was also used to guard the stables at night. The breed had been developed and cultivated chiefly in England. The first unofficial standard for the breed was introduced by an Englishman Vero Shaw in 1882. In 1890 with the formation of the first Dalmatian Club in England the standard became official. When the dog with the distinctive markings was first shown in England in 1862, it was said to have been used as a guard dog and companion to the nomads of Dalmatia. The breed's unique coat became popular and widely distributed over the continent of Europe beginning in 1920. Its unusual markings were often mentioned by the old writers on cynology.\n\n\n=== Duties ===\n\nThe roles of this ancient breed are as varied as their reputed ancestors. They were used as dogs of war, guarding the borders of Dalmatia. To this day, the breed retains a high guarding instinct; although friendly and loyal to those the dog knows and trusts, it is often aloof with strangers and unknown dogs. Dalmatians have a strong hunting instinct and are an excellent exterminator of rats and vermin. In sporting, they have been used as bird dogs, trail hounds, retrievers, or in packs for wild boar or stag hunting. Their dramatic markings and intelligence have made them successful circus dogs throughout the years.\nDalmatians are perhaps best known for working for the firefighters for their role as firefighting apparatus escorts and firehouse mascots. Since Dalmatians and horses are very compatible, the dogs were easily trained to run in front of the carriages to help clear a path and quickly guide the horses and firefighters to the fires.Dalmatians are often considered to make good watchdogs, and they may have been useful to fire brigades as guard dogs to protect a firehouse and its equipment. Fire engines used to be drawn by fast and powerful horses, a tempting target for thieves, so Dalmatians were kept in the firehouse as deterrence to theft.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n=== \"Firehouse dog\" ===\nDalmatians are associated with firefighting, particularly in the United States. In the days of horse-drawn fire engines, dogs would guard the horses, who could easily become uncomfortable at the scene of a fire. Dalmatians were a popular breed for this job, due to their natural affinity to horses and history of being used as carriage dogs. This role became redundant once horse-drawn fire engines were replaced with steam and diesel powered ones. Due to its history, the Dalmatian often serves as a mascot for the fire service, and is still chosen by many firefighters as a pet. The Dalmatian is also the mascot of the Pi Kappa Alpha International Fraternity, which has been associated with firefighting.\n\n\n=== \"Anheuser-Busch dog\" ===\n\nThe Dalmatian is also associated, particularly in the United States, with Budweiser beer and the Busch Gardens theme parks, since the Anheuser-Busch company's iconic beer wagon, drawn by a team of Clydesdale horses, is always accompanied by a Dalmatian.\nThe company maintains several teams at various locations, which tour extensively. Dalmatians were historically used by brewers to guard the wagon while the driver was making deliveries.\n\n\n=== 101 Dalmatians ===\nThe Dalmatian breed experienced a massive surge in popularity as a result of the 1956 novel The Hundred and One Dalmatians written by British author Dodie Smith, and later due to the two Walt Disney films based on the book. The Disney animated film, released in 1961, later spawned a 1996 live-action remake, 101 Dalmatians. In the years following the release of the sequel 102 Dalmatians, the breed suffered greatly at the hands of irresponsible breeders and inexperienced owners. Many well-meaning enthusiasts purchased Dalmatians\u2014often for their children\u2014without educating themselves on the breed and the responsibilities that come with owning such a high-energy dog breed. Dalmatians were abandoned in large numbers by their original owners and left with animal shelters. As a result, Dalmatian rescue organizations sprang up to care for the unwanted dogs and find them new homes. AKC registrations of Dalmatians decreased 90% during the 2000\u20132010 period.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCompanion dog\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDalmatian dog at Curlie\nDeafness in Dogs: LSU & Dr. Strain\n\"Congenital Sensorineural Deafness in Dalmatian Dogs Associated with Quantitative Trait Loci,\" by Susanne Kluth and Ottmar Distl (PLOS \u2013 December 04, 2013)\nDalmatian-Pointer Backcross information translated to multiple languages"}, {"id": 163, "name": "Dandie Dinmont Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom, Scotland", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog163", "description": "A Dandie Dinmont Terrier is a small Scottish dog breed in the terrier family. The breed has a very long body, short legs, and a distinctive topknot of hair on the head. They are friendly but tough, and are suitable for interaction with older children. There are no breed-specific health concerns, but they can be affected by spinal problems due to their elongated body, and the breed is affected by canine cancer at a higher than average rate.\nThe breed is named after a fictional character in Sir Walter Scott's novel, Guy Mannering. This character, Dandie Dinmont, is thought to be partly based on James Davidson, who is credited as the originator of the modern breed. Davidson's dogs descended from earlier terrier-owning families, including the Allans of Holystone, Northumberland.\nThere are three breed clubs in the UK supporting the breed, although it is registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club due to its low number of puppy registrations per year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe breed originates from the dogs being used in the border country of Scotland and England. During the 1600s, they were used for hunting badgers and otters. Whilst their ultimate origin remains unknown, dogs owned by the Allans of Holystone, Northumberland in the early 1700s are thought to have been involved in their early origins.These dogs may have been a type of Border Terrier, although other theories exist including the idea that they are a cross between Scottish Terriers and Skye Terriers. The head of this family was Willie \"Piper\" Allan, who was born in nearby Bellingham. He kept dogs for the hunting of otters. Lord Ravensworth once hired Allan to remove the otters from the pond in Eslington Park. Lord Ravensworth attempted to purchase one of Allan's dogs after he successfully removed the otters, which Allan refused.Allan died on 18 February 1779, and his dogs passed into the care of his son James. James's son eventually inherited the dogs and sold a dog named Old Pepper to Mr Francis Sommer who came from Town Yetholm on the Scottish side of the border. Old Pepper was descended from one of Willie Allan's dogs who had worked Lord Ravensworth's manor.The breed remained relatively unknown outside of the Borders until 1815 when Sir Walter Scott's novel Guy Mannering was published. Scott had spent time in the area whilst the Sheriff of Selkirkshire and had learned of the prowess of these types of specialist terriers for working both fox and otter. When he wrote Guy Mannering, he included a character by the name of Dandie Dinmont who owned a number of terriers named Pepper and Mustard after the colours of their coats. The Dinmont character was partly based on the real life farmer and terrier owner, James Davidson, who too used the generic terms of Pepper and Mustard for his dogs depending on their coats. Davidson's dogs came from a variety of sources including the dogs of the Allan, Anderson and Faas families. Davidson documented his breeding, and he has been accepted as the originator of the modern breed.\n\nSome interbreeding with other breeds took place in the mid-1800s, which may have introduced Dachshund blood into the breed, although certain breeders maintained pure-bred lines. The Dachshund theory was first introduced by John Henry Walsh under the pseudonym of \"Stonehenge\" in the 1880s, and was denied by many breeders of that era. By the mid-1800s, the breed was known as the Dandie Dinmont Terrier, and became sought after for hunting after Scott's writings were published. They remain the only dog breed to have been named after a fictional character. Around this time the breed had some involvement in the development of the Bedlington Terrier.The Kennel Club formed in 1873 and, at the Fleece Hotel at Selkirk, Scottish Borders on November 17, 1875, the Dandie Dinmont Terrier Club (DDTC) was formed, becoming the third oldest breed club for dogs in the world. Lord Melgund was the society's first president, while E Bradshaw Smith was the first vice president. Breeders Hugh Dalziel and William Stachen were also involved in the formation of the club. The breed standard was created by William Wardlaw Reid, another founding member of the club, with it was agreed to a year later at another meeting of the club. A club show was held for the first time in Carlisle in 1877. Shows after this were held in conjunction with other clubs on a yearly basis until 1928 when it moved to the Market Hall in Carlisle, where with the exception of during the Second World War, the shows continued to be held until 1982. Shows continued to be held in the general area until 2001 when they moved south to Cheshire and Lancashire.The DDTC is not the only breed club in the UK. For a while several breed clubs were created in Scotland, but none lasted particularly long except for the Scottish Dandie Dinmont Terrier Society which merged into the DDTC in 1929. Today, in addition to the DDTC, there are also the Southern Dandie Dinmont Terrier Society, and for Scotland, the Caledonian Dandie Dinmont Club.\n\nThe breed was first registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1888. The Dandie Dinmont Terrier was recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in 1918. During the Second World War many kennels were dispersed and the dogs destroyed, due to both the lack of food caused by rationing and that of manpower. Following the war several kennels led the way to re\u2013establishing the breed including the Bellmead Kennels, located first in Surrey before later moving to Old Windsor. Dandies continued to be bred up at Bellmead up until the early 1990s, when it passed into the hands of Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.In 2006, the Kennel Club recognised the Dandie Dinmont Terrier as one of the rarest dog breeds native to the British Isles, putting it on a new list of Vulnerable Native Breeds. The breeds chosen for this list were those who originated in the UK and Ireland, but had less than 300 puppy registrations per year. One particularly low period was between July and September 2003, when only 21 puppies were registered, of which 18 were male. Overall that year, only 90 puppies were registered in the UK, compared to 9,823 for the West Highland White Terrier. Additionally numbers had dropped to low levels in America as well, with the AKC registering only 75 puppies in the same time period. Following work since 2006, the Dandie Dinmont registration numbers have improved slightly, with 151 puppies registered with the Kennel Club in 2010, the highest number for any year in the last ten years. Of other breeds of native terrier, only the Skye, Sealyham, Manchester and Glen of Imaal Terriers have lower registration figures.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe breed has short legs, with an elongated body. Unusually among Scottish terrier breeds, it has pendulous ears. The neck is muscular, having developed from the breed's use against larger game. The typical height at the withers is 8\u201311 inches (20\u201328 cm), and they can weigh anywhere between 18\u201324 pounds (8.2\u201310.9 kg).While the Dandie generally is a hardy breed, it may have issue climbing stairs. They have a silky coat which forms a topknot on top of the dog's head. The Dandie Dinmont Terrier has a similar body shape to the Skye Terrier, but the Skye's coat is thicker and longer.The coat comes in two colour ranges, pepper and mustard. Pepper ranges from dark blueish black to very light silvery gray; mustard can vary from reddish brown to fawn, with the head appearing to be almost white. Typically, the legs and feet are of a darker colour with the lighter colour on the body slowly blending into that on the legs. The depth of the coat can reach up to 2 inches (5.1 cm). The colour of the coat is usually set by the time the dog reaches eight months of age, but the Dandie Dinmont Terrier will continue to mature physically until around two years old.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe breed is tough but usually friendly and is suitable for older children. It makes both a good companion and a guard dog but is among the most docile of the terrier breeds; they are usually quite undemanding of their owners. However they are known for their ability to dig large holes in a short space of time. They can be trained to be good with cats but should not be trusted around smaller animals such as hamsters or rats. They are described as being \"very game\", in that they are prone to challenging other animals, including foxes, and in some cases other dogs.\n\n\n== Health ==\nDue to the breed's elongated body, there can be back problems within the breed, specifically with intervertebral discs in the dog's back. These discs can sometimes slip out of place, resulting in spinal disc herniation. Symptoms depend on what part of the dog's back is affected; they can include paralysis with loss of bladder and bowel control in the worst cases.Following work by the breed clubs to ensure that any reoccurring health problems are dealt with, there are no especially common conditions affecting the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. However, minor problems affecting the breed can include hypothyroidism, primary closed angle glaucoma and Cushing's syndrome. In order to combat glaucoma in the breed, the breed clubs recommend that Dandies should have a procedure called a gonioscopy performed on them at regular intervals throughout their lives. The Dandie is also at slightly higher risk of canine cancer than average. The average life expectancy of a Dandie Dinmont Terrier is 11\u201313 years.\n\n\n== References ==\nSpecific\n\nGeneral\n\n\n== External links ==\nDandie Dinmont Terrier at Curlie"}, {"id": 164, "name": "Danish Swedish Farmdog", "country": "Denmark, Sweden", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog164", "description": "Dansk-svensk g\u00e5rdshund (Danish\u2013Swedish Farmdog) is a pure breed of dog that has its origin in Denmark and southern Sweden, but has become popular all over Scandinavia. It is an old native breed which has historically lived on farms in the eastern part of Denmark and southernmost part of Sweden (i.e. on both sides of The Sound, the narrow strait that separates the Danish island of Zealand from the southern tip of the Scandinavian peninsula), serving as a guard dog, rat catcher and hunting dog. The breed's soft and gentle temperament also makes them excellent companion dogs.\nDanish-Swedish Farmdogs are also companion dogs, making them an ideal pet for Scandinavian farmers. There are some indications that the breed originates from the Pinscher breeds and the British white hunting terriers.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe Danish\u2013Swedish Farmdog became a recognized breed in Denmark and Sweden in 1987.  At that time, the two countries got together and agreed on the name of the breed, and also on the breed standard written by judge and breeder Lars Adeheimer, Sweden and judge Ole Staunskjaer, Denmark. The DSF was used as a farm dog for many hundreds of years, and before becoming a recognized breed it was known under the local name \"Skrabba\", \"Sk\u00e5neterrier\", \"r\u00e5ttehund\", \"rat dog\").\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe FCI standard says that a DSF should be 30\u201339 cm of height with a compact body. The relation between withers height and body length should be 9 to 10. The head is rather small and triangular with a well-emphasized stop. The coat is hard, short and smooth in texture, with white as a dominating colour, with one or several patches of different colour combination. The tail could be long, half bobtail or bobtail.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Danish\u2013Swedish Farmdog is a very friendly, easygoing breed.  Not only does it work on farms as a rat extinguisher and alerting to intruders, but it is also a companion to adults, and is known to befriend and play with the children of the household.\nThe Danish\u2013Swedish Farmdog is unlike a terrier - even though it is often mistaken as one - it is very mild and gentle in temper. Unlike the high-strung nature of the terrier, the nature of the DSF allows it to do its job, as well as be calm and loving during times without work. This makes it an ideal house companion.\nThe DSF is a not a high energy dog, but loves having a job.  The breed is new to the USA, and can only now start to be seen in sports such as flyball and dog agility.  The DSF is also known for its excellent mousing skills and can perform sports such as going to ground and earthdog.  They are also very speedy and quick, and love all types of lure coursing.\nIn 2010, the breed club, Danish-Swedish Farmdogs USA, made application to AKC-FSS for recognition of the breed.  In January 2011, the American Kennel Club (AKC) added the breed to its Foundation Stock Service.  The Danish-Swedish Farmdog is now eligible to compete in various AKC companion events such as obedience, agility, rally and more.  In November 2011, the AKC announced that as of July 2012, FSS breeds would be eligible for Open Conformation shows.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDanish/Swedish Farmdog Club of America, Inc.\nFarmdogsUSA.\nFCI Breed Standard\nThe official Danish Farmdog Club\nThe official Swedish Farmdog Club\nAmerican Kennel Club Foundation Stock Service"}, {"id": 165, "name": "German Hound", "country": "Germany", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog165", "description": "The German Hound (Deutsche Bracke) (FCI No. 299) is a breed of dog originating in Westphalia, a region of Germany. The German Hound is of the scenthound type, used for hunting both large and small game. The breed is normally referred to as the Deutsche Bracke in English, rather than by the translation of the name, German Hound.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe German Hound  is a small hound, 40 \u2013 53 cm (16 - 21 ins) at the withers, with long, drooped ears and a long, narrow tail. It is distinguished by a long, somewhat narrow head, and a rectangular body, described as \"elegant\".The coat has hard, almost bristly, short fur, usually tricolor (red to yellow with a black mantle), with white markings called Bracken marks - a white muzzle, chest, legs, collar, and tip of the tail, and a blaze on the head.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Bracke are an ancient type of hound. Their distinctive narrow heads and long ears set them apart from other types of hounds, and may show influence of the Greyhound or the ancient Celtic hounds. The St. Hubert's Hound (Bloodhound) may have contributed to the Bracke's voice, the distinctive call made by the dogs while chasing game. Over a very long period of time, Bracke developed into a variety of regional forms.In 1896, the Deutschen Bracken Club, encompassing all of the local types of Bracke in northwest Germany, was formed in Olpe. The breeds were merged in 1900 as one breed and were officially designated Deutsche Bracke. This breed was formerly called by a variety of old regional names such as \"Olpe Bracke\", \"Sauerl\u00e4nder Bracke\" and \"Westphalian Bracke\", and other local types now blended into one breed. The only breeds of Bracke in the area today are the German Hound and the Westphalian Dachsbracke. The Westphalian Dachsbracke is a short-legged dog, possibly a cross of a Bracke  with the Dachshund, the Westphalian Dachsbracke.Hunting with the Bracke in early times was done  with hunters on horses following the hounds, as done by the ancient Celts chasing deer, and modern-day fox hunters. Another sport, developed in the 16th century,  did not require the expense of horses and big kennels, and made use of firearms, called Brackade. Hounds hunting this way tenaciously follow the game while voicing cries that communicate to the hunter as to where the dog is and what type of game the dog is following. Today, the Deutsche Bracke is usually used to hunt deer, but also rabbits and fox. Often, it is hunted singly as a leash hound, to hunt on smaller areas. The space needed to hunt a pack of hounds is described by the breed club as a minimum area of 1,000 ha (2471 acres). Related to the hunting with Bracke is the use of horns to communicate with the dogs, a custom that is continued today.\n\nThe German Hound was recognized by the Verband f\u00fcr das Deutsche Hundewesen (German Kennel Club) through the Deutschen Bracken Club was formed in 1886 and continues today, and oversees breeding and hunt testing, as well as preserving traditions of Bracke hunting. The German Hound was the first Bracke to be registered as a distinct breed, in 1900. and by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale as breed number 299 in Group 6 (Scenthounds), Section 1.3 (Small hounds). Of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world, only the United Kennel Club in the US recognises the German Hound, in its Scenthound Group. The German Hound also may be recognised by any of the many minor registries, rare breed groups, hunting clubs, and internet registry businesses under its original name, discarded antique names, translations of the name, or variations on the name. The German Hound is strictly a hunting dog, and seldom seen outside its native country. Outside the home country, purchasers of dogs represented as German Hound should research the dog's background, especially if it is registered with one of the minor clubs that require little to no documentation before accepting a dog or litter for registration.\n\n\n== Names ==\nHistorically, the term Bracke was used in German to mean the scenthounds. Brack is an old Low German word for a coastal marsh periodically inundated by storm surges with salt water-the English word brackish. In Europe, scenthounds are usually separated into running hounds (free running packs, which either drive the game back to the hunter, or the hunter follows as they run, or the hunter waits until the dogs' cries communicate that game has been found and held, and then goes to that spot) or leash hounds (which follow the game or track wounded or dead game while being held on a leash by the hunter.) The Bracke are usually used as running hounds, in packs, to hunt rabbits or foxes in a type of hunt called Brackade.\n\n\n== Health and character ==\nNo specific diseases or claims of extraordinary health have been documented for this breed. According to the original German breed club, although it is a hunting dog, it is affectionate and benefits from living with the family rather than in a kennel. It is a very persistent tracking dog with a good sense of direction.\n\n\n== Related breeds ==\nThe German Hound is related to the Westf\u00e4lische Dachsbracke (Westphalian Dachsbracke, FCI No. 254) and the Drever, also called the Swedish Dachsbracke. The Finnenbracke (No. 51) is from Finland. The Alpenl\u00e4ndische Dachsbracke (Alpine Dachsbracke, FCI No. 254) is from Tyrol, in Austria, as is the Tiroler Bracke or Tyrol Hound (FCI No. 68).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHunting dog\nHound\nScent hound\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 166, "name": "Doberman Pinscher", "country": "Germany", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog166", "description": "The Dobermann (; German pronunciation: [\u02c8do\u02d0b\u0250man]), or Doberman Pinscher in the United States and Canada, is a medium-large breed of domestic dog that was originally developed around 1890 by Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann, a tax collector from Germany.  The Dobermann has a long muzzle. It stands on its pads and is not usually heavy-footed. Ideally, they have an even and graceful gait. Traditionally, the ears are cropped and posted and the tail is docked. However, in some countries, it is illegal to do so. Dobermanns have markings on the chest, paws/legs, muzzle, above the eyes, and underneath the tail.\nDobermanns are known to be intelligent, alert, and tenaciously loyal companions and guard dogs. Personality varies a great deal between each individual, but if taken care of and trained properly, they are generally considered to be loving and devoted companions. The Dobermann is driven, strong, and sometimes stubborn. Owning one requires commitment and care. With a consistent approach, they can be easy to train and will learn very quickly.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nWorld Breed standards are published by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, or FCI (World Canine Organisation), on the advice of the IDC (International Dobermann Club), which is the Dobermann breed's governing council and has 36 countries in its member list. To become a world champion, dogs are judged to FCI standards. The AKC has its own standards, as do some other countries, although most still adhere to FCI standards. The breed standard describes the Dobermann as a dog of medium size that is also strong and muscularly built. In order to be eligible to meet these standards, the body of the Dobermann should appear to be almost square.\nIt should also appear elegant and noble.\nThe dog was originally intended as a guard dog, so males typically have a muscular and intimidating appearance. Females are usually thinner, but should not be spindly.\nThe American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standard differs from the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) standards, with the latter being an often larger and heavier dog. This has led some to argue that Dobermanns and Doberman Pinschers should be considered and evaluated differently.\n\n\n=== Size and proportions ===\nAlthough the breed standards vary among kennel and breed clubs, most follow the standard set by the FCI, which describes the size of male dogs as 68 to 72 centimetres (27 to 28 in) at the withers; The Kennel Club in the UK quotes 69 centimetres (27 in) as being ideal. The size of female dogs, according to the same standards, is 63 to 68 centimetres (25 to 27 in), with 65 centimetres (26 in) being ideal. The Dobermann has a square frame; its length should equal its height to the withers and the length of its head, neck, and legs should be in proportion to its body.The standards for the weight of the Dobermann are also described by the FCI. The ideal dog must be of a sufficient size for an optimal combination of strength, endurance and agility. The ideal weight of male dogs is described as 40\u201345 kilograms (88\u201399 lb) and the ideal weight of female dogs is described to be 32\u201335 kilograms (71\u201377 lb).\n\n\n=== Color ===\nTwo different color genes exist in the Dobermann: one for black (B) and one for color dilution (D). There are nine possible combinations of these alleles, which can result in four different color phenotypes: black, blue, red, and fawn (a.k.a. Isabella). The traditional and most common color occurs when both the color and dilution genes have at least one dominant allele (i.e., BBDD, BBDd, BbDD or BbDd) and is commonly referred to as black, black and rust, or black and tan. The red, red rust, or brown coloration occurs when the black gene has two recessive alleles but the dilution gene has at least one dominant allele (i.e., bbDD, bbDd). The blue Dobermann has the color gene with at least one dominant allele and the dilution gene with both recessive alleles (i.e., BBdd or Bbdd). The fawn coloration is the least common, occurring only when both the color and dilution genes have two recessive alleles (i.e., bbdd). Thus, the blue color is a diluted black, and the fawn color is a diluted red.\nExpression of the color dilution gene is a disorder called Color Dilution Alopecia, a kind of canine follicular dysplasia. Although not life-threatening, these dogs can develop skin problems.In 1976, a \"white\" Doberman Pinscher was whelped and was subsequently bred to her son, who was also bred to his litter sisters. This tight inbreeding continued for some time to allow the breeders to \"fix\" the mutation. White Dobermanns are a cream color with white markings and blue eyes. Although this is consistent with albinism, the proper characterization of the mutation is currently unknown. The animals are commonly known as tyrosinase-positive albinoids, lacking melanin in oculocutaneous structures. This condition is caused by a partial deletion in the SLC45A2 gene.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Tail ===\nThe Dobermann's natural tail is fairly long, but individual dogs often have a short tail as a result of docking, a procedure in which the majority of the tail is surgically removed shortly after birth.\n\nThe practice of docking has been around for centuries and is older than the Dobermann as a breed. The generally accepted reason for docking is to ensure that the tail does not get in the way of the dog's work. Docking has always been controversial, however. Docking and cropping (see below) have been written out of the Breed Standard by FCI and IDC, and dogs born after 2016 will not be allowed to participate in FCI or IDC shows without a full tail and natural ears. This is mirrored in most EU and Commonwealth countries. In the UK, dogs with docked tails have been banned from show for a number of years and the practice is now illegal for native born dogs. Veterinary Certificates are required as proof to avoid prosecution on imported animals. It has also been made illegal in many other European countries, as well as Australia. The American Kennel Club standard for Doberman Pinschers includes a tail docked near the 2nd vertebra. Docking is a common practice in the United States, Russia, and Japan (as well as a number of other countries with Dobermann populations), where it remains legal.\n\n\n=== Ears ===\nDobermanns often have their ears cropped, a procedure that is thought to be done for functionality for both the traditional guard duty and effective sound localization. According to the Doberman Pinscher Club of America, ears are \"normally cropped and carried erect\". Like tail docking, ear cropping is illegal in many countries and has never been legal in some Commonwealth countries.\n\n\n== Intelligence ==\n\nCanine intelligence is an umbrella term that encompasses the faculties involved in a wide range of mental tasks, such as learning, problem-solving, and communication. The Doberman Pinscher has been ranked amongst the most intelligent dog breeds in experimental studies and expert evaluations. Psychologist Stanley Coren ranks the Dobermann as the 5th most intelligent dog in the category of obedience command training, based on the selective surveys answered by experienced trainers (as documented in his book The Intelligence of Dogs). Additionally, in two studies, Hart and Hart (1985) ranked the Doberman Pinscher first in the same category, and Tortora (1980) gave the Dobermann the highest rank in general trainability. Although the methods of evaluation differ, these studies have consistently shown that the Doberman Pinscher, along with the Border Collie, Standard Poodle, German Shepherd, Golden Retriever, and Rottweiler, is one of the most trainable breeds of dog.\n\n\n== Aggression ==\nAlthough they are considered to be working dogs, Dobermanns are often stereotyped as being ferocious and aggressive. As a personal protection dog, the Dobermann was originally bred for these traits: it had to be large and intimidating, fearless, and willing to defend its owner from attackers (especially other guard dogs), but sufficiently obedient and restrained to do so only on command. These traits served the dog well in its role as a personal defense dog, police dog, or war dog, but were not ideally adapted to a companionship role. The Dobermann's aggression has been toned down by modern breeders over the years, however, today's Dobermanns are known to have a much more even and good-natured temperament, as well as extreme loyalty, high intelligence and great trainability.  The modern Dobermann is known to be energetic, watchful, fearless and obedient.\n\nThey can easily learn to 'Respect and Protect' their owners and are therefore considered by many to be excellent guard dogs. Given that they are properly socialized from a young age, they are generally sociable toward familiar humans and can also be sociable with other dogs. However, Dobermanns do rank among the more-likely breeds to show aggressive behaviour toward strangers and other dogs, though they are not among the most likely to do so. They are highly unlikely to show aggressive behaviour toward their owners.\nThere is some evidence that Doberman Pinschers in North America have a calmer and more even temperament than their European counterparts because of the breeding strategies employed by American breeders. Because of these differences in breeding strategies, different lines of Doberman Pinschers have developed different traits. Although many contemporary Doberman Pinschers in North America are gentle and friendly to strangers, however, some lines are bred more true to the original personality standard.The personality of the Doberman Pinscher is known to be unique. There is a great deal of scientific evidence that Doberman Pinschers have a number of stable psychological traits, such as certain personality factors and intelligence. As early as 1965, studies have shown that there are several broad behavioral traits that significantly predict behavior and are genetically determined. Subsequently, there have been numerous scientific attempts to quantify canine personality or temperament by using statistical techniques for assessing personality traits in humans. These studies often vary in terms of the personality factors they focus on and in terms of ranking breeds differently along these dimensions. One such study found that Doberman Pinschers, compared to other breeds, rank high in playfulness, average in curiosity/fearlessness, low on aggressiveness and low on sociability. Another such study ranked Doberman Pinschers low on reactivity/surgence and high on aggression/disagreeableness and openness/trainability.In addition to the studies of canine personality, there has been some research to determine whether there are breed differences in aggression. In a study published in 2008, aggression was divided into four categories: aggression directed at strangers, owner, strange dogs, and rivalry with other household dogs. This study found that the Doberman Pinscher ranked relatively high on stranger-directed aggression, but extremely low on owner-directed aggression. The Doberman Pinscher ranked as average on dog-directed aggression and dog rivalry. Looking only at bites and attempted bites, Doberman Pinschers rank as far less aggressive towards humans and show less aggression than many breeds without a reputation (e.g., Cocker Spaniel, Dalmatian, and Great Dane). This study concluded that aggression has a genetic basis, that the Dobermann shows a distinctive pattern of aggression depending on the situation and that contemporary Doberman Pinschers are not an aggressive breed overall. In regards to Dobermanns attacking owners, it is rare and usually in the case of overdiscipline. Dobermanns accept physical punishment to an extent. However, when they consider it to no longer be punishment, but an attack on themselves, they will defend themselves.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 1979 and 1998, the Doberman Pinscher was involved in attacks on humans resulting in fatalities less frequently than several other dog breeds such as German Shepherd Dogs, Rottweilers, Husky-type dogs, wolf-dog hybrids and Alaskan Malamutes. According to this Center for Disease Control and Prevention study, one of the most important factors contributing to dog bites is the level of responsibility exercised by dog owners.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Dobermann's lifespan is about 10\u201313 years on average. The breed is prone to a number of health concerns. Common serious health problems include dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), cervical vertebral instability (CVI), von Willebrand's disease (a bleeding disorder for which genetic testing has been available since 2000), and prostatic disease. Less serious common health concerns include hypothyroidism and hip dysplasia. Canine compulsive disorder is also common. Studies have shown that the Doberman Pinscher suffers from prostatic diseases, (such as bacterial prostatiti, prostatic cysts, prostatic adenocarcinoma, and benign hyperplasia) more than any other breed. \nDilated cardiomyopathy is a major cause of death in Dobermanns. This disease affects the breed more than any other. Nearly 40% of DCM diagnoses are for Dobermann Pinschers, followed by German Shepherds at 13%. More recent studies based on European dogs, however, has indicated that DCM affected rates are much higher for this population than their American relatives: around 58% of European Dobermanns will develop DCM within their lifetime. Research has shown that the breed is affected by an attenuated wavy fiber type of DCM that affects many other breeds, as well as an additional fatty infiltration-degenerative type that appears to be specific to Dobermann Pinscher and Boxer breeds.\nThis serious disease is likely to be fatal in most Dobermanns affected.Roughly a quarter of Dobermann Pinschers who develop cardiomyopathy die suddenly from seemingly unknown causes, and an additional fifty percent die of congestive heart failure. Among female Dobermanns, the sudden death manifestation of the disease is more common, whereas males tend to develop congestive heart failure.  In addition to being more prevalent in Dobermanns, this disease is also more serious in the breed. Following a diagnosis, the average non-Dobermann has an expected survival time of 8 months; for Dobermann Pinschers, however, the expected survival time is less than 2 months. Although the causes for the disease are largely unknown, there is evidence that it is a familial disease inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Investigation into the genetic causes of canine DCM may lead to therapeutic and breeding practices to limit its impact.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of the Dobermann breed is sometimes disputed by experts; however, it's generally thought that Dobermanns were first bred in the 1880s by Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann in the town of Apolda, in the German state of Thuringia. It is generally disagreed upon what Dobermann's main job was, but it is known for certain that he ran the Apolda dog pound. With access to dogs of many breeds, he got the idea to create a breed that would be ideal for protecting him, as whatever job he was believed to took- a tax collector, a night watchman, a rent collector, and other such things- surely were dangerous. He set out to breed a new type of dog that, in his opinion, would exhibit impressive stamina, strength, and intelligence. Five years after his death, Otto Goeller, one of the earliest breeders, created the National Doberman Pinscher Club and is considered to have perfected the breed, taking on the work of breeding and refining them in the 1890s.\n\nThe breed is believed to have been created from several different breeds of dogs that had the characteristics that Dobermann was looking for. The exact ratios of mixing, and even the exact breeds that were used, remain uncertain, although many experts believe that the Dobermann Pinscher is a combination of several breeds including the Beauceron, German Pinscher, Rottweiler and Weimaraner. The single exception is the documented crossing with the Greyhound and Manchester Terrier. It is also widely believed that the old German Shepherd gene pool was the single largest contributor to the Dobermann breed. Philip Greunig's The Dobermann Pinscher (1939), is considered the foremost study of the development of the breed by one of its most ardent students. Greunig's study describes the breed's early development by Otto Goeller, whose helpedto establish the breed. The American Kennel Club believes the breeds utilized to develop the Dobermann Pinscher may have included the old shorthaired shepherd, Rottweiler, Black and Tan Terrier and the German Pinscher.After Dobermann's death in 1894, the Germans named the breed Dobermann-pinscher in his honor, but a half century later dropped the word 'pinscher' on the grounds that this German word for 'terrier' was no longer appropriate. The British did the same a few years later; now the US and Canada are the only countries who continue to use Pinscher and have dropped an \"n\" from Dobermann's surname.During World War II, the United States Marine Corps adopted the Doberman Pinscher as its official war dog, although the Corps did not exclusively use this breed in the role.\nIn the United States, the American Kennel Club ranked the Doberman Pinscher as the 12th most popular dog breed in 2012 and 2013.\n\n\n== Popularity ==\nDoberman Pinscher became very popular over a short period.  It's a relatively new breed less than 150 years old. According to latest ranking in 2017 by American Kennel Club, Dobermans are the 16th most popular dog breed. Dobermans started to become popular when they were used in World War II as guard dogs. In 1970's Doberman had their fair share in movies. They starred in the 1972 film 'The Doberman Gang'. Doberman also became popular after winning four Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1939, 1952, 1953 and 1989. Doberman dog breed recognised by American Kennel Club in 1908 and since then they are one of the most popular dog breed due to their intelligence and agility. Even today the numbers of Doberman dog registrations are increasing.\n\n\n== Famous Dobermanns ==\nGraf Belling v. Gr\u00f6nland: first registered Dobermann, in 1898.\nFirst Dobermann registered with the American Kennel Club, 1908\nCappy, a Dobermann who saved the lives of 250 U.S. Marines when he alerted them to Japanese soldiers. Cappy became the first K-9 casualty, 23 July, when he was mortally wounded by a Japanese grenade. He was the first to be buried in what would become the war dog cemetery and he is the dog depicted in bronze sitting quiet but alert atop the World War II War Dog Memorial. Cappy, along with 24 other Dobermanns whose names are inscribed on the memorial, died fighting with the US Marine Corps against Japanese forces on Guam in 1944.\nCh. Rancho Dobe's Storm: consecutive Westminster Best in Show (1952, 1953).\nBingo von Ellendonk: first Dobermann to score 300 points (perfect score) in Schutzhund.\nCh. Borong the Warlock: won his championship title in three countries, including 230 Best of Breed, 30 Specialty Show \"bests,\" six all-breed Best in Show, and 66 Working Groups. He was the only Dobermann ever to have won the Doberman Pinscher Club of America National Specialty Show three times, and in 1961 five Dobermann specialists judged him Top in the breed in an annual Top Ten competition event.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nDobermann at Curlie"}, {"id": 167, "name": "Dogo Argentino", "country": "Argentina", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog167", "description": "The Dogo Argentino is a large, white, muscular dog that was developed in Argentina primarily for the purpose of big-game hunting, including wild boar. The breeder, Antonio Nores Mart\u00ednez, also wanted a dog that would exhibit steadfast bravery and willingly protect its human companion. It was first bred in 1928, from the Cordoba Fighting Dog along with a wide array of other breeds including the Great Dane.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Dogo Argentino is a large white short-coated dog with muscular and strong body that rarely has any markings (any type of marking or spot on the coat is considered a flaw). While it is not accepted in many of the clubs, a Dogo Argentino can have a black spot on its head known as 'pirata' and it is accepted by the Federaci\u00f3n Cinol\u00f3gica Argentina.Breed Standard Height: for females is 60\u201365 centimetres (24\u201326 inches) and for males is 60\u201368 centimetres (24\u201327 inches), measured at the withers. Weight: from 40\u201345 kilograms (88\u201399 pounds). The length of the body is just slightly longer than the height. The length of the front leg (measured from point of elbow to the ground) is approximately equal to one-half of the dog's height at the withers. The head has a broad, slightly domed skull and the muzzle is slightly higher at the nose than the stop, when viewed in profile. The tail is set low, thick at the base and tapers to a point. It has been described as looking similar to the American Bulldog but very tall with a solid white coat. The breed has also been described as looking similar to the American Pit Bull Terrier, even though the American Pit Bull Terrier is far smaller (13.5 to 27 kilograms).\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1928, Antonio Nores Martinez, a medical doctor, professor and surgeon, set out to breed a big game hunting dog that was also capable of being a loyal pet and guard dog. Antonio Martinez picked the Cordoba Fighting Dog to be the base for the breed. This breed is extinct today, but it was said that as a large and ferocious dog, it was a great hunter. Martinez crossed it with the Great Dane, Boxer, Spanish Mastiff, Old English Bulldog, Bull Terrier, Pyrenean Mastiff, Pointer, Irish Wolfhound and Dogue de Bordeaux. Nores Martinez continued to develop the breed via selective breeding to introduce the desired traits.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nDogos are big-game hunters and are also trained for search and rescue, police assistance, service dogs, guide for the blind, competitive obedience, Schutzhund and military work.The Dogo Argentino because of its purpose, is very stubborn and pain tolerant. This combined with the breed's natural intelligence and domineering tendencies mean that this dog is not suitable for inactive or inexperienced homes, and is ideal for a working home, or at a minimum a very active home. The breed needs an experienced owner and firm leadership, and is not ideal as a pet or service dog role, though it has been successful in the latter.\nThe Dogo is an intelligent and courageous dog with a strong, natural instinct to protect its home and family. Dogos are very social dogs and are happiest when included in all family activities. Dogos make a strong distinction between familiar people and strangers, so it is imperative that they be well trained and socialized at an early age.\nDogos are hunters of great courage and endurance, and will work individually or in packs. They have also successfully been used in police protection work. An unsteady temperament is a serious fault. {UKC Breed Standard} The Dogo has a life expectancy of 10 to 12 years.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nAs in the Dalmatian, white Boxer, and the white Bull Terrier, the dogo may experience pigment-related deafness. There is possibility of an approximate 10% deafness rate overall with some dogos afflicted uniaurally (one deaf ear) and some binaurally (deaf in both ears). Studies have shown that the incidence of deafness is drastically reduced when the only breeding stock used is that with bilaterally normal hearing.\n\n\n== Hunting and legality ==\n\nWhile the Dogo Argentino was bred primarily from the extinct Cordoba Fighting Dog, it was bred to be a cooperative hunter, i.e. to accompany other catch dogs and bay dogs on the hunt without fighting with the other dogs.  Aggressive traits inherent in the Cordoban Dog were specifically bred out to enable a stable cooperative nature in a pack. However, in areas where illegal dog fighting continues, the Dogo Argentino has been used for fighting due to its fearless nature and great stamina.The Dogo Argentino is banned or has ownership restrictions in certain countries including Ukraine, Denmark, Iceland, Fiji, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and the Cayman Islands. In the United Kingdom, under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, it is illegal to own a Dogo Argentino without lawful authority.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBombon (film) Carlos Sor\u00edn's, a 2005 film starring a Dogo Argentino named Gregorio\nAlano Espa\u00f1ol\nCimarr\u00f3n Uruguayo\nCordoba Fighting Dog\nDogo (dog type)\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 168, "name": "Dogo Cubano", "country": "Cuba", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog168", "description": "The Dogo Cubano, also known as the Cuban Dogge, Cuban Bloodhound and Cuban Mastiff is an extinct dog breed from Cuba. It was of the Bullmastiff type and was used for bull and dog fighting.\nThe breed was introduced in Cuba to capture runaway slaves (cimarrones).  After the abolition of slavery, they ceased to exist in time.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThey were between a Bulldog and a Mastiff in size. The muzzle was short, broad, and abruptly truncated. The head was broad and flat, and the lips, deeply pendulous. The medium-sized ears, were also partly pendulous, the tail  rather short, cylindrical, and turned upwards and forwards towards the tip. They were described as a \"rusty wolf-colour\", with black face, lips, and legs. They were very notable for their chasing of slaves.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Cuban Mastiff developed from several breeds of bulldogs, Mastiffs and cattle dogs, becoming an ideal fighter and property guardian. It is possible that some specimens of this breed were brought to America where they were employed as watchdogs. They were also used as slave retrievers by the British during the Second Maroon War, by the French during the Saint-Domingue expedition, as well as the American in the southern States.\nThe breed has been considered extinct since the end of the 19th century, but there have been reports which state that although no pure Dogo Cubanos remain, the dogs used in today\u2019s fighting pits in Cuba are descendants of crossbreeding between pit bull-type dogs, Cordoba Fighting Dogs, Dogo Argentinos and the few pure Dogo Cubanos that were remaining by the beginning of the 20th century. The modern descendant of this extinct dog breed is much larger and stronger than the original and resembles the American Pit Bull Terrier.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of dog fighting breeds\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDogo Cubano Page at Molosser World"}, {"id": 169, "name": "Dogue de Bordeaux", "country": "France", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog169", "description": "The Dogue de Bordeaux, Bordeaux mastiff, French mastiff or Bordeauxdog is a large French mastiff breed\u2014and one of the most ancient French dog breeds. A typical brachycephalic molossoid type breed, the Bordeaux is a very powerful dog, with a very muscular body. This brawny breed has been put to work in many different capacities, from pulling carts and hauling heavy objects, to guarding flocks and, historically, the castles of the European elite.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Dogue de Bordeaux was known in France as early as the fourteenth century, particularly in southern France in the region around Bordeaux. Hence, the city lent its name to this large dog.\nA uniform breed type of the Bordeaux dog did not exist before about 1920.The French placed emphasis on keeping the old breeding line pure. Black masks were considered an indication of the crossing in of the English mastiff. As an important indication of purity of the breed, attention was paid to the self colored (pink) nose, lighter eye color (dark amber), and red mask. They were originally bred with huge heads; a pioneer for the breed in Germany, Werner Preugschat once wrote:\n\nWhat am I supposed to do with a dog that has a monstrous skull and is at most able to carry it from the food dish to its bed?\nThe Dogue de Bordeaux was at one time known to come in two varieties, Dogues and Doguins, the Dogue being considerably larger than the Doguin. The smaller Doguin has withered away to nothing more than a mention in breed history books, and is no longer in existence.\nThe history of the breed is believed to predate the bullmastiff and the bulldog. It is said that the Dogue can be found in the background of the bullmastiff, and others claim that the Dogue and bastiff breeds were both being accomplished at the same time. Another theory is the Dogue de Bordeaux originates from the Tibetan mastiff and it is also said that the Dogue is related to the Greco Roman molossoids used for war.As there was a breed similar to the Dogue de Bordeaux in Rome at the time of Julius Caesar's reign, possibly a cousin of the Neapolitan mastiff. Others suggest that the Dogue de Bordeaux is a descendant of a breed which existed in ancient France, the Dogues de Bordeaux of Aquitaine. Whichever theory is true, the Dogue de Bordeaux shares the same common links as all modern molossers.\nThe Dogue de Bordeaux was once classified into three varieties, the Parisian, the Toulouse and the Bordeaux, types which were bred depending on the region of France and the jobs it was required to do. The ancestral Dogue de Bordeaux had various coat colors, such as brindle and a majority of white markings that carried fully up the legs. It had scissor bites in some regions, undershot in others; a big head or a small head, a large body or a small body; very inconsistent in type. Another controversial aspect was the mask, red (brown), none or black. The Dogue de Bordeaux of Bordeaux of the time also sported cropped ears. Regardless, it had a general type similar to today's Dogue de Bordeaux.\n\n\n=== Breeding ===\n\nIn 1863, the first canine exhibition was held at the \"Jardin d'Acclimatation\" in Paris, France. The winner of the Dogue de Bordeaux was a female named Magentas. The Dogue de Bordeaux was then given the name of the capital of its region of origin, today's Dogue de Bordeaux.\nDuring the 1960s, a group of breeders of the Dogue de Bordeaux in France, headed by Raymond Triquet, worked on the rebuilding of the foundation of the breed. In 1970, a new standard was written for the breed, with the most recent update in 1995. This standard is the basis of the standard written for the AKC in 2005.\nAlthough the Dogue de Bordeaux first arrived in the USA in the 1890s for the show ring, the first documented Dogues de Bordeaux of modern times appeared in 1959, Fidelle de Fenelon; and in 1968, Rugby de la Maison des Arbres. Between 1969 and 1980, imported Dogues de Bordeaux in the USA were scarce, limited to a few breeders who worked closely with the French Dogue de Bordeaux Club, the SADB. The breed was first \"officially\" introduced to American purebred enthusiasts in an article written in 1982 and by the American anthropologist, Dr. Carl Semencic for \"Dog World\" magazine. That article, entitled \"Introducing the Dogue de Bordeaux\", was followed by chapters dedicated to the Dogue in Semencic's books on dogs, published by T.F.H. Publications of Neptune, New Jersey. When Semencic's first article on the breed was published, there were no Bordeaux Dogues in the United States. There were 600 examples left in the world, mostly in France, the Netherlands and East Berlin, and the breed's numbers were on the decline. Much later, in 1989, the typical American family saw the Dogue de Bordeaux for the first time on the big screen in Touchstone's movie Turner & Hooch about a policeman and his canine partner, although many people did not know that the massive slobbering animal was a Dogue de Bordeaux.\nSince then, the Dogue de Bordeaux has taken hold in the United States and can be found in greatly increasing numbers across the country. The Dogue de Bordeaux has been supported by multiple breed clubs throughout the years, and has finally found its way to full American Kennel Club recognition through the assistance of the Dogue de Bordeaux Society of America. Since 1997, the society has helped bring the breed to the point in which full AKC recognition could be achieved.\nThe Dogue de Bordeaux has begun to flourish is recent years, with its introduction into more movies and even television, as well as its full recognition status by the AKC, also known as the AKC (full AKC recognition began July 2008). Its numbers are climbing, but careful attention must be paid to health in the breed if its increase in popularity is to show a positive forward motion.\nThe breed was first exhibited in France in 1863 after which time it gained in popularity not only in their home country but in other parts of the world. The first record of Dogue de Bordeaux in the UK can be seen in the Kennel Club Gazette in 1897. The breed was officially recognised by the Kennel Club (UK) in 1997 but it was not until 2001 that the Kennel Club (UK) accepted an interim breed standard.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Dogue de Bordeaux is a well balanced, muscular and massive dog with a powerful build. Its size should come mostly from width and muscles, rather than height.\nThe breed is set somewhat low to the ground and is not tall like the English mastiff. The body of the Dogue de Bordeaux is thick-set, with a top-line that has a slight dip (topline is never completely straight) and a gentle rounded croup. The front legs should be straight and heavy-boned, well up on pasterns, down to tight cat-like feet. The straight tail, beginning thickly at the base and then tapering to a point at the end, should not reach lower than the hocks, and is set and carried low. The breed is to be presented in a completely natural condition with intact ears, tail, and natural dewclaws. It should be evaluated equally for correctness in conformation, temperament, movement, and overall structural soundness.\n\n\n=== Weight ===\nThe breed standards by European FCI and the AKC specify a minimum weight of 99 pounds (45 kg) for a female and 110 pounds (50 kg) for a male. There is no formally stated maximum weight, but dogs must be balanced with regard to their overall type and the conformation standards of the breed.\n\n\n=== Height ===\nThe standard states that the desirable height, at maturity, should range between 24 to 27 inches (61 to 69 cm) for male dogs and from 23 to 26 inches (58 to 66 cm) for females. Deviation from these margins is considered a fault.\n\n\n=== Head ===\n\nThe massive head is a crucial breed characteristic. The Dogue de Bordeaux is claimed to have the largest head in the canine world, in proportion to the rest of the body. For males, the circumference of the head, measured at the widest point of the skull, is roughly equal to the dog's height at the withers (shoulders). For females, the circumference may be slightly less. When viewed from the front or from above, the head of the Dogue forms a trapezoid shape with the longer top-line of the skull, and the shorter line of the underjaw, forming the parallel sides of the trapezoid. The jaw is undershot and powerful. The Dogue should always have a black or red mask that can be distinguished from the rest of the coat around and under the nose, including the lips and eye rims. The nose colour in red-masked dogs should be brown, in black-masked dogs, it must be black. The muzzle should be at most a third of the total length of the head and no shorter than a quarter of the length of the head, the ideal being between the two extremes. The upper lip hangs thickly down over the lower jaw. The upper lips of the Dogue de Bordeaux hangs over the lower lips. The skin on the neck is loose, forming a noticeable dewlap, but should not resemble that of a Neapolitan mastiff. Small pendant ears top the head, but should not be long and hound like.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\n\nThe standard specifies the coat to be 'short, fine, and soft to the touch'. Color varies from shades of fawn (light, coppery red) to mahogany (dark, brownish red) with a black, brown, or red mask, although the red mask is true to the breed. White markings are permitted on the tips of the toes and on the chest, but white on any other part of the body is considered a fault, and a disqualifying one if the pigmentation goes beyond the neck.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nWhile larger breeds of canines tend to have shorter life expectancy, the life expectancy of the Dogue is still shorter than even breeds of comparable or larger size. According to data collected by the Dogue De Bordeaux Society of America, the average lifespan of the breed is 5 to 6 years. A veterinary database in the UK showed similar figures. In the American survey, the oldest dog in the record was 12 years old. The Society is actively recording dogs that are 7 years old or older to celebrate the longer-lived dogs.Because of its brachycephalic head, the Dogue can be affected by breathing problems. Some may be intolerant of heat or exercise as a result. The FCI standard considers excessive shortness of breath and raspy breathing in the Dogue a severe fault. The brachycephalic head shape can also encourage ectropion\u2014an outward rolling of the lower eyelid\u2014 which can lead to conjunctivitis (eye inflammation) and bacterial infections. Under the UK Kennel Club's Breed Watch system, the Dogue is classed as a Category 3 breed (formerly High Profile Breed), meaning it is a breed \"where some dogs have visible conditions or exaggerations that can cause pain or discomfort.\"Aortic stenosis is a disease of the heart valve in which the opening of the aortic valve is narrowed. Symptoms include exercise intolerance, exertional syncope (fainting from physical exertion) and sudden death. One study suggests a high predisposition in the breed. No severe cases were found in adult dogs, and most moderate to severely affected dogs died before one year of age, leading the authors to speculate that the disease is more severe in the Dogue than in other breeds.Another heart problem in the breed is dilated cardiomyopathy, a condition in which the heart becomes weakened and enlarged and cannot pump blood efficiently. Some affected dogs may die suddenly without showing any signs of problems. Others may die from congestive heart failure after several weeks or months. Affected dogs are often euthanized at an early stage to avoid suffering.An estimated 5% of dogs may be affected by footpad hyperkeratosis, a thickening of the footpad and sometimes nose. X-rays submitted voluntarily to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals shows that more than 50% of Dogues in the database are affected by hip dysplasia.\n\n\n=== Reproduction ===\nData from the Norwegian Kennel Club indicates a mean litter size of 8.1 puppies (ranging from 2-17) for the breed. The breed has a high stillborn and early neonatal mortality rate, with a stillborn rate of 14.2% and early neonatal mortality (death within 1 week from birth) of 10.4%. The average across all breeds in the study was 4.3% stillbirth and 3.7% early neonatal mortality. Excluding stillborn and early deaths, the mean litter size is 6.1.

Called the Dutch Partridge Dog (or \"Drent\" for Drenthe) in English, approximately 5,000 dogs are registered with the breed club in the Netherlands, and breed clubs operate in Belgium, Denmark, Scandinavia and North America. The Drentsche Patrijshond bears some resemblance to both spaniel and setter types of dog. An excellent pointer and retriever, this dog is often used to hunt fowl and adapts equally well to the field or marshes.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nValid color is white with brown or orange markings. Mostly white with large brown plates (spots). There is usually one plate that covers the backside above the tail. A mantle (large marking across the back) is permissible, but generally less desired.  The coat is medium long, with feathers on the leg and longer hair on the front of the chest, giving the impression of a longer haired coat. The  Drentsche Patrijshond is 55 to 63 cm (22 to 25 in). at the withers.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origins of the Drentsche Patrijshond are in the 16th century, from the Spioenen (or Spanjoelen) which came to the Netherlands through France from Spain, and is related to the Small M\u00fcnsterl\u00e4nder of Germany and the Epagneul Fran\u00e7ais of France. In the Netherlands, these dogs were called partridge dogs. \nThe presence of the partridge dogs had been visible for centuries, as in the 17th-century painting The Hunter's Present, c. 1658-60, by Gabriel Metsu. In the painting, the partridge dog leans against the hunter's knee, as the man is handing a woman a partridge, which was a double entendre at the time. The dog in The Hunter's Present is a very large, stocky dog that could possibly pull a cart; showing the range of the early type, a much smaller, lighter dog of the same type is shown in another painting by the same artist, The Poultry seller, 1662. This painting also involves a woman being offered a bird, regarded with suspicion by her dog.\nBefore formal recognition as a modern breed in 1943, the type had been kept separate from other dogs as an undocumented breed for centuries in the rural province of Drenthe. As the Drentsche Patrijshond is a breed developed in the Netherlands, the breed standard was first developed and approved in 1943 by the Raad van Beheer op Kynologisch Gebied (Dutch Kennel Club), the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale national kennel club for the Netherlands. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale recognised the breed using the standard developed by the breed's country of origin as the standard to be used in international competition. The United Kennel Club in the United States also recognises the breed using the outdated (February 1994) F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale standard. \nIn November 2010, the AKC recognized the Drentsche Patrijshond Club of North America (DPCNA) and the Drentsche Patrijshond was added to the AKC Foundation Stock Program, allowing owners of registered Drents to participate in AKC sanctioned events such as hunt tests and agility competitions, starting in 2011.\n\n\n== Use ==\nThe province of Drenthe three hundred years ago was unusual, in that it allowed the common gentry the right to hunt. The local mayor, the farmer, and landowners in general developed dogs to support their pursuit of various small game.  Unlike many other hunting breeds, which were developed by, and for, the elite or nobility only to hunt, the Drentsche Patrijshond was expected to hunt all game, and also pull duty as watch dog, child playmate, etc.  Some were even used to pull the dog-carts of the day. For over 300 years, the Drentsche Patrijshond type has been an all-around dog.\nPerfectly suited to the walk-up (upland) hunter, the Drent is thorough, in order to find all the game on the smaller plots available in Drenthe. It hunts with good speed, within reach of the gun. As with most European versatile breeds, the Drentsche Patrijshond points and retrieves, and will hunt both birds and small mammals, including rabbit, hare and fox. Today, the Drent is a favorite gun dog throughout its native country of the Netherlands, with approximately 5,000 dogs registered with the breed club.\n\n\n== Health ==\nBreed health concerns may include progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and hereditary stomatocytosis.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThough the breed shows a strong hunting instinct in the field, and can be quite driven, these dogs tend to be more relaxed in the home than many of the hunting breeds. They are strongly attached to family members, loyal, and of sweet disposition, particularly with children.\n\n\n== Exercise ==\nHappiest when working alongside a hunter, the Drent enjoys the company of humans in the great outdoors. Several brisk turns around the park will satisfy it as well. Although it will come home and quietly assume its position on its bed, it should not be mistaken for a sedentary dog - the breed will suffer if insufficiently exercised.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSchapendoes, another breed originating in Drenthe\nRijksmuseum\nCommon pheasant\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Dutch breed club for Drentsche Patrijshond\nDutch breed club for Drentsche Patrijshond\nDrentsche Patrijshond Club of North America\nBelgian breed club for Drentsche Patrijshond\nDanish breed club for Drentsche Patrijshond\nScandinavian countries Drentsche Patrijshond Club"}, {"id": 171, "name": "Drever", "country": "Sweden", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog171", "description": "The Drever is  a breed of dog, a short-legged scenthound from Sweden used for hunting deer and other game. The Drever is descended from the Westphalian Dachsbracke, a type of German hound called Bracke. The breed name Drever was chosen through a contest in 1947.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Drever's most noticeable characteristic are its long body and short legs, inherited from the Westphalian Dachsbracke, but as a working dog these features are not exaggerated. It has short fur, and is of any color with white markings (but not all white, which has been linked to deafness.) The breed has the typical drop (hanging) ears of a hound, and a long tail. The maximum height of a Drever is 38 cm (15 ins) at the withers, which is about 15 cm (approx. 6 ins) shorter than a long legged hunting hound with the same size body. The Westphalian Dachsbracke is about 2 cm (less than an inch) shorter than the Drever.\n\n\n== Hunting ==\nMost breeds with similar physical traits are bred for a single purpose, but the Drever has been bred to hunt all sizes of game, both hares and roe deer, and is also used to hunt fox and red deer. The Drever has a lot of stamina, and has become a popular hunting hound for deer hunters in northern Norway, Sweden, and Finland (in Finland drevers are not allowed in deer hunting yet, but it is used for hare and fox hunting). Roe deer are nervous quarry, and the hounds which are used to hunt them must move slowly, especially in areas where heavy snow can be expected in late autumn.  This is given as the reason for breeding of a dog with a medium-sized body but short legs.\nThe Drever in Sweden is usually kept as a hunting hound and is not usually found as a pet.\n\n\n== History and recognition ==\nThe Drever is a Swedish breed originating with the Westphalian Dachsbracke (a small hound for tracking deer), brought from Germany to Sweden around 1910,  and crossbred with other hounds to adjust \"to Swedish terrain and game.\" By the 1940s there were two distinctive sizes of the Dachsbracke, and a newspaper contest was held in 1947 to choose the new name for the slightly larger variety; Drever was chosen, from the Swedish word drev, referring to a type of hunt where the dogs drive the game towards the hunter. The Drever was then recognised by the Swedish Kennel Club as a separate breed in 1947. The breed is recognised internationally by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, in Group 6 Scenthounds and related breeds, Section 1.3, Small-sized Hounds.The Drever  was recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club in 1956 in the Hound Group,  and in 1996 by the United Kennel Club in its Scenthound Group. The breed is also recognized by a long list of minor registries, rare breed groups, hunting clubs, and internet registry businesses, and is promoted in North America as a rare breed pet. It is not currently recognized by The Kennel Club (UK), the Australian National Kennel Council or the New Zealand Kennel Club, or the American Kennel Club.\n\n\n== Health ==\nSpecific health problems or claims of extraordinary health have not been documented for this breed. According to the breed standard, the Drever should be alert and self-possessed, with an affable, even temperament, and should not be aggressive or shy.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWestphalian Dachsbracke and the closely related Deutsche Bracke\nDachshund a short-legged Bracke\nHunting dog\nHound\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDrever The American Drever Association\nDrever information on Canada Dogs\nThe Swedish Drever Club (in Swedish)\nThe Finnish Drever Club (in Finnish)\nDrever at Curlie"}, {"id": 172, "name": "Dunker", "country": "Norway", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog172", "description": "A Dunker, also known as the Norwegian Hound, is a medium-sized breed of dog from Norway. It was bred by Wilhelm Dunker to be a scenthound by crossing a Russian Harlequin Hound with dependable Norwegian scent hounds.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Dunker has a clean, noble, long head with parallel planes of the skull and muzzle, carried low and not wedge-shaped. Its skull is slightly domed with a defined stop and clean cheeks, the muzzle is long and square-cut with a straight and broad nasal bridge, and its teeth are evenly spaced with a scissors bite. The Dunker has a black nose with wide nostrils, round, large, and dark eyes, and low-set, wide, flat, ears that hang close to the head and to the middle of the muzzle.The Dunker has a long neck with no throatiness, sloping shoulders, straight forelegs, a level topline, a straight and strong back with broad and muscular loins, and a slight tuck up in the chest. Its hindquarters are well-angulated, as are its stifle, and its thighs and hocks are broad. The feet are arched, well-knit, have firm pads and hair between the toes, and point straight ahead. The tail is set on level with the topline, strong at the root, tapering at the end, straight, carried in a slight upward curve, and reaches to the hock.The Dunker's coat is straight, hard, dense, and not too short, with the most desirable colors being black or blue marbled with pale fawn and white markings. Less desirable are warm brown or predominant black reaching from the muzzle and beyond the hock joint, a black mask, and overmarked white, and more than fifty percent white color is a disqualification.The Dunker weighs around 35\u201339 pounds (16\u201318 kg), and males are 19.5\u201321.5 inches (50\u201355 cm) at the withers, while females are 18.5\u201320.5 inches (47\u201352 cm).\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThis is quite a friendly and relaxed breed. It will provide these traits only to owners who will offer lots of activity.\n\n\n== Health ==\nOccasionally, cases of hip dysplasia can occur. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe breed is named after the Norwegian Wilhelm Dunker, who bred this dog for hunting hares at the beginning of the 19th century. To create the Dunker,  Wilhelm crossed a Russian Harlequin Hound with reliable scent hounds, producing a dog that could hunt rabbits by scent, rather than sight. It has yet to become popular outside of its homeland.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 173, "name": "Dutch Shepherd", "country": "Netherlands", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog173", "description": "The Dutch Shepherd is a herding dog of Dutch origin. They were used by shepherds and farmers who needed a versatile dog, with few demands, and a dog that was able to adapt to a harsh and meager existence.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins of the Northern European Shepherds ===\nThe Dutch Shepherd was discovered as a naturally occurring shepherd's dog type living in the rural areas of the larger region that today includes the Netherlands. When the first breed standard was written in 1898, the coat could be any colour. But, in 1914, it was decided to allow only brindle to distinguish the breed from the then similar German Shepherd and Belgian Shepherd. The breeds eventually diverged into the three distinct breeds as known today. However, the Dutch Shepherd remains nearly the same dog it was more than 100 years ago. Today, the Dutch Shepherd is distinguished from the Belgian and German Shepherds by the details specified in the breed standard, primarily of the head.\n\n\n=== Function ===\nOriginally the main function of the Dutch Shepherd  was that of a shepherd\u2019s dog in the countryside. From early times, the Dutch had an arable culture that was maintained by flocks of sheep. The dogs had to keep the flock away from the crops, which they did by patrolling the borders of the road and the fields. They also accompanied the flocks on their way to the common meadows, markets and ports.At the farm, they kept the hens away from the kitchen garden, they herded the cows together for milking and pulled the milk carts. They also alerted the farmers when strangers entered the farmyard. Around 1900, sheep flocks had for the greater part disappeared in the Netherlands. The versatile skills of the Dutch Shepherd made him suitable for dog training, which was then starting to become popular. They were then trained and used as police dogs, as search and tracking dogs, and as guide dogs for the blind. They are, however, still capable of herding sheep.\n\n\n=== Near extinction ===\nThe population of the Dutch Shepherd was greatly reduced due to modern farming techniques nearly eliminating the need for the breed as a sheep tender, and in the 1940s and 1950s the breed was almost exterminated. The Second World War put a stop to breeding of most dog breeds in the Netherlands. Dogs died from lack of food, or were taken to Germany by the German military.  Many bloodlines became extinct.After the war, breeding began anew and new blood was needed to diversify the gene pool. Sometimes dogs of unknown origin were used. The Malinois was used for a time, but the practice was stopped because the buyers of those puppies did not have the same goals as the Dutch Breed Club. In 1959, with permission from the breed club, a Laekenois dog was used to expand the rough-hair population. With time, the popularity of the breed grew and expanded into other countries.Today the Dutch Shepherd is still a rare breed. The Dutch Breed Club encourages all owners of dogs meeting the minimum conformation standards to breed them, and guidelines are laid out so as to increase their number and diversify the gene pool while preserving the health of the breed.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Dutch Shepherd on average weigh between 50\u201370 pounds (23\u201332 kg) and the height varies between 55\u201363 cm (approximately 22 to 25 inches tall at the withers). Depending on the coat the breed can be distinguished as short-hair, long-hair, or rough-hair.Short-hair: All over the body, quite hard, close-fitting, with woolly undercoat. Ruff, breeches and tail plume are clearly visible.\nLong-hair: All over the body, long, straight, well fitting, harsh to the touch, without curls or waves and with a woolly undercoat. Distinct ruff and breeches. Tail abundantly coated. Head, ears and feet and also the hind legs below the hocks are short and densely coated. The backsides of the forelegs show a strongly developed coat, shortening in length towards the feet, the so-called feathering. No fringes at the ears.\nRough-hair: Dense, harsh tousled coat and a woolly, dense undercoat all over the body except for the head. Upper- and lower lip should be well-covered with hair, the whiskers and beard, and two well defined, coarse rough eyebrows that are distinct but not exaggerated. Furnishings are not soft. The hair on the skull and on the cheeks is less strongly developed. In profile it seems as if the head has a more square appearance. Strongly developed breeches are desirable. Tail is covered all round with hair. The brindle colour may be less pronounced because of the tousled coat.\n\n\n=== Colour ===\nBrindle. The basic colour is golden or silver, and can vary from a near white light sand-coloured to chestnut red. A \"true silver brindle\" is very rare, because having too much white is considered a fault. The brindle is clearly present all over the body, in the ruff, breeches and tail. Too much black is undesirable. A black mask is preferable. Heavy white markings on chest or feet is not desirable.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nDutch Shepherds are loyal, reliable, alert, watchful, active, independent, intelligent, and intuitive.\nObedience and discipline can be achieved with remarkable results. Gifted with a true shepherding temperament, they can supposedly work willingly together with their owners and can deal independently with any task they are assigned, being neither aggressive nor shy. They have a strong character and independence passed down from their herding ancestry.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Dutch Breed Club initiated a hotline in 2008 for reporting health and behavioral problems. Most genetic health problems occur at a low rate in this breed. Confirmed genetic diseases diagnosed in Dutch Shepherd Dogs include allergies (atopy), masticatory myositis, pannus, cryptorchidism, and inflammatory bowel disease. \nWithin the rough-hair population care should be taken to screen for goniodysplasia before breeding. This is a condition where the outflow of fluid from the eye is restricted and under certain circumstances can cause blindness. The link between genetics and goniodysplasia is uncertain. Two dogs who have a risk of goniodysplasia can still have puppies who are not at risk. The Dutch Breed Club regulations requires the testing for GD for rough-hairs.The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals reports hip dysplasia is present at an overall rate of 8.5 percent on 389 dogs evaluated from Jan 1972 through Dec 2017 (while also reflecting a lower 7.2 percent on dogs born between 2011-2015)  and elbow dysplasia is present at a rate of 4.1 percent on 291 dogs evaluated from Jan 1972 through Dec 2017.A previously unknown inflammatory and necrotizing myopathy affecting Dutch Shepherd dogs was genetically mapped in 2018 by the University of Minnesota Canine Genetics Laboratory who identifies this disease as IM: Inflammatory Myopathy (Myositis). The disease causes progressive, painful inflammation of skeletal muscle tissue. The first symptoms of the disease, which usually present between three and eight months of age, include a \u201cbunny hopping\u201d gait and rear leg stiffness, then, escalate to include muscle tremors, progressive weakness, and severe muscle atrophy.  The Dutch Shepherd Dog Club of America financed genetic research to analyze and interpret molecular information to identify this disease, which was spearheaded by Dutch Shepherd Dog Club of America veterinary counsel Karen Wroblewski DVM.  \nDr. Wroblewski orchestrated a nationwide collaboration of veterinary professionals, breeders and Dutch Shepherd fanciers resulting in the description of this new condition, discovery of the causative mutated gene, definition of the mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive), and now, availability of a new DNA screening test available through University of Minnesota.  The UMN College of Veterinary Medicine has updated their Canine Genetic Testing webpage to include submission forms and instructions for submitting samples for Dutch Shepherd Inflammatory Myopathy testing to identify carriers of the disease.  Both parents must be carriers to produce affected offspring, but as long as one of the two parents is IM clear, affected offspring will NOT be produced.  The University of Minnesota Canine Genetics Laboratory has also coordinated with the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals to have the IM test results listed on the OFA website.\n\n\n== Grooming ==\nThe short-haired variety needs occasional combing, with the exception during the shedding period in the spring and fall when a daily thorough brushing is needed. The long-haired variety needs to be groomed about once a week, or more frequently depending on work and environment. The rough-hair variety needs to be thoroughly brushed once a week, and twice a year the dead hair will need to be hand stripped.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe Dutch Shepherd is an active and versatile breed. They compete in dog agility, obedience, Rally obedience, flyball, dock jumping, disc dog, tracking, search and rescue, nosework, weight pulling, along with protection sports such as Schutzhund, French Ring, Belgian Ring, mondioring, PSA and others. In the Netherlands it is still employed as a herder and the instinct is still strong in the breed.\nInternationally, the Dutch Shepherd is best known for use in law enforcement under the KNPV program. The Koninklijke Nederlandse Politiehond Vereniging (KNPV), or Royal Dutch Policedog Association, was founded 27 October 1907, as an organization to oversee and test dogs for their suitability for police work. Dutch Shepherds with KNPV titles are sought after candidates throughout the world for police and military use, as well as sport competitors and personal protection dogs. The KNPV began a dog registration program in 2014 for KNPV member dogs, making registration mandatory for all dogs born after 1 April 2013.\n\n\n== Registry ==\n\n\n=== FCI ===\nThe F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) is an overseeing entity for many international purebred dog breed registries, including the Dutch Kennel Club (Raad van Beheer). The FCI itself is not a registry and does not issue pedigrees, instead the FCI has 90 members and contract partners (one member per country) that each issue their own pedigrees and train their own judges.  The 'owner' countries of the breeds write the breed standards that are used as reference for judges at shows held in FCI member countries.  Some member countries have an open studbook by which dogs can be registered based on appearances and other FCI member countries have closed studbooks. The Dutch studbooks were closed on 1 February 1971. The goal of the FCI is, in part, \u2018to protect the use, the keeping and the breeding of purebred dogs in the countries where the FCI has a member or a contract partner\u2019.  The United States of America is not an FCI Member or Contract Partner.\n\n\n=== The Dutch Shepherd in the United States ===\nThe kennel club of registry for the Dutch Shepherd in the United States is the United Kennel Club, having first published their breed standard on 1 January 1995.  Established in 1898, the United Kennel Club is the largest all-breed performance-dog registry in the world, registering dogs from all 50 US states and 25 foreign countries.  More than 60 percent of its nearly 16,000 annually licensed events are tests of hunting ability, training and instinct.  UKC registered Dutch Shepherds successfully compete in conformation, obedience, agility, rally, weight pull, nosework, dock jumping, lure coursing and previously in protection/police dog events through the now defunct Dog Sport program.  The Dutch Shepherd Dog Club of America (UKC Provisional National Breed Club) reveals the UKC reflects 1,499 permanently registered Dutch Shepherds in their archives, but indicates the number of active (under the age of 12) Dutch Shepherds total 1,091 dogs (as of 31 December 2017).As of 2012, the Dutch Shepherd is being recorded by the American Kennel Club in their Foundation Stock Service, accepting pedigrees from some FCI members as eligibility but declining membership to dogs with pedigrees from certain other FCI member countries.   FSS breeds are not eligible for AKC registration, however once individually registered under the FSS program, a Dutch Shepherd is able to compete in the AKC companion events of obedience, tracking, agility and rally. The American Dutch Shepherd Association states they maintain a listing of the dogs registered in the American Kennel Club\u2019s FSS database and in 2017 reflected a total of 230 Dutch Shepherds registered in the USA and Canada.  The American Kennel Club board of directors voted their approval on 16 January 2016 of moving the Dutch Shepherd to the Miscellaneous Class effective 1 January 2017 and has designated the American Dutch Shepherd Association as the AKC Parent Club for the breed.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAllemaal 'Hollanders', herdershonden van eigen bodem.

It is very rare and not well known outside the Netherlands, its country of origin.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Dutch Smoushond is small in size, at the maximum 10 kg in weight and  43 cm at the withers. Its waterproof coat is rough and shaggy, and of any shade of yellow colour. The characteristic shape of the head is broad and short, with drop ears set high on the head.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Hollandse Smoushond Club (Smoushondenclub) was formed in 1905 to document and register the small stable dog as a purebred breed, as it was in danger of dying out. Its origins may have been with the ancestor of the Schnauzer breed, as an incorrect yellow colour. The name refers to its shaggy fur and face, as Jewish men (called Smouzen in the 1800s, a slur deriving from the name Moses) had beards and long hair. They were called \"Dutch\" to prevent confusion with the similar Brussels Griffons.  During World War II, the breed nearly disappeared. In 1973, several breeders began to reconstruct the breed with the few remaining dogs, most of whom had been crossbred with other breeds. Much of the reconstruction was accomplished with the use of Border Terrier crosses. There is illustrated reference to the breed in Dutch artist Rien Poortvliet's popular 1996 book, \"Dogs.\"\n\n\n== Recognition ==\n\nAlthough popular in the Netherlands, the breed is not well known elsewhere in the world. It was recognised in 2001 by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale and placed in the Group 2, Section 1: Pinschers and Schnauzers, Section 1.3 Smoushond. Of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world, it is recognised only by the United Kennel Club in the United States (classified in its Terrier Group.) It also may be found listed by some of the vast number of internet-based minor registries and dog registry businesses as a \"rare breed\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nSchnauzer\nPinscher\nTerrier\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 175, "name": "East Siberian Laika", "country": "Russia", "type": "Northern Breed", "picture": "dog175", "description": "The East Siberian Laika (Vostotchno-Sibirskaia Laika) is a Russian breed of dog of spitz type, a hunting dog originating in parts of Siberia east of the Yenisei River.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nMales are 55 to 66 centimetres (22 to 26 in), while females are on the smaller side at 51 to 60 centimetres (20 to 24 in).\nBlack and tan, with light patches (called karamis), grizzle, patched, ticked, white, grey, black, red and brown of all shades. There are two major types, the Evenki and the Irkutsk; other less important types are the Yakutia, Amur and Tofolar. These types vary in color and physique, as the ESL is still more of a diverse conglomerate breed than the other three Russian Laika breeds. Physically the ESL is somewhat rangy, nearly square in proportion, slightly higher at the withers than at the croup, robust in bone; head shape varies with the regional varieties. Ears are erect and triangular, the tail carried in a curve over the back. The coat is a medium long double coat with straight coarse guard hair and a soft thick undercoat.\n\n\n=== Purpose ===\nThe ESL is a natural hunting dog used for a wide variety of small and large game, ranging from squirrels, marten, sable, and grouse to moose, bear, wild boar and mountain lions. They can also be used as sled dogs.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nHighly aggressive towards large predators, they are calm and well-tempered with people, although they can be good watchdogs and if encouraged will be protective against human intruders. Generally, they seem to be good companion dogs and can also be trained in obedience.\n\n\n== Origin and History ==\nThe breed designation was established at the All-Union Cynological Congress in 1947, along with that of the other three Laika breeds. The breed originated with dogs from the Lake Baikal region, Irkutsk Province, Evenki National Territory, the Amur River basin and Maritime Territory.

The Elo is notable in that it is primarily selected and bred according to behavioral characteristics and social behavior, with the goal of creating the best family pet.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nBred to a behavioral rather than an appearance standard, the appearance of the Elo can vary from dog to dog, although the breed standard (breed standards describe a breed's external appearance) describes the size as 46\u201360 cm (Gro\u00dfelo)and 35\u201345 cm (Kleinelo) at the withers, and weighing 22\u201335 kg (Gro\u00dfelo) and 10\u201315 kg (Kleinelo), with a body that is slightly longer than tall, and a well plumed tail (meaning with lots of long fur) often carried in a curve over the back. The prick ears are furry, wide set, and slightly rounded at the ends. The coat comes in a long (Rauhaar) and medium (Glatthaar) length, both with a dense undercoat, with all colours allowed, with a white with brown, red, black, or gray spots particularly desired.\n\n\n== History ==\nMarita and Heinz Szobries began crossing their Eurasiers and Bobtails (Old English Sheepdogs) in 1987, believing that, although very different in detail, the breeds were of similar type and had arisen as breeds under similar conditions. Dogs from the cross that showed unique characteristics and good health were bred further. Due to the lack of sufficient Eurasiers, a similar breed, the Chow Chow, was added, and later, Samoyeds and Dalmatians were added to expand the genetic base. Breeding has continued with long term focus on the inheritance of character. The name \"Elo\" (originally Eloschaboro) is from letters of the 3 breeds \u2013 Eurasier, Bobtail and Chow-Chow \u2013 and is protected by trademark in Germany. Breeding dogs with the name Elo is allowed only with the consent of the founders of the Elo breed.\n\n\n== Health ==\nAs with all created breeds, the Elo's small population size results in the risk of inbreeding and its after-effects of inbreeding depression, and frequent occurrence of hereditary diseases. There is a susceptibility to distichia, in which corneal damage can occur.\nPart of the process of accepting a dog for breeding is an eye examination (for prevention of distichia) and X-rays to avoid breeding dogs with hip dysplasia.\nA genetic study has been done in Germany using the Elo, calculating the proportion of genes of the different founder breeds, of the inbreeding coefficient and relationship coefficients, and the percentage of stillborn puppies in litters. The study also found that all but 3.5% of the Elo were related to each other. The significant gene percentages of the Elo are 48% Eurasier, 23% Old English Sheepdog, 10% Chow Chow. The inbreeding coefficient was found to be 12.04%.\n\n\n== Related varieties ==\nA related crossbreed, from the Pekingese and various small spitz-type breeds, called Klein-Elos, is being developed in the same manner by the same people.\nAlthough the crossbreed's development is well monitored, dog and puppy buyers in North America and other areas outside of the European Union will have to determine whether dogs being sold as Elo are the carefully bred Elo Breeding and Research Association dogs, or a similar mix bred together to fulfill the demands of the \"rare breed\" pet market.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nElo on the Open Directory Project"}, {"id": 178, "name": "English Cocker Spaniel", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog178", "description": "The English Cocker Spaniel is a breed of gun dog. The English Cocker Spaniel is an active, good-natured, sporting dog standing well up at the withers and compactly built. There are \"field\" or \"working\" cockers and \"show\" cockers. It is one of several varieties of spaniel and is the foundation of it's American cousin, the American Cocker Spaniel. The English Cocker is closer to the working-dog form of the Field Spaniel and the English Springer Spaniel.\nOutside the US, the breed is usually known simply as the Cocker Spaniel, as is the American Cocker Spaniel within the US. The word cocker is commonly held to stem from their use to hunt woodcock.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSpaniel type dogs have been found in art and literature for almost 500 years. \nInitially, spaniels in England were divided among land spaniels and water spaniels. The differentiation among the spaniels that led to the breeds that we see today did not begin until the mid-19th century. During this time, the land spaniels became a bit more specialised and divisions among the types were made based upon weight. According to the 1840 Encyclopedia of Rural Sports, Cockers were 12\u201320 lb (5.5\u20139 kg). \nAt this time it was not uncommon for Cockers and Springers to come from the same litter. Even a puppy from a \u201cToy\u201d sized lineage could grow to be a springer.There is no indication from these early sources that spaniels were used to retrieve game. Rather they were used to drive the game toward the guns.During the 1850s and 1860s, other types of Cockers were recorded. There were Welsh Springer Spaniels and Devonshire Cockers. Additionally, small dogs from Sussex Spaniel litters were called Cockers. \nIn 1874 the first stud books were published by the newly formed kennel club. Any spaniel under 25 lb (11 kg) was placed in the Cocker breeding pool, however the Welsh Cocker was reclassified as a Springer in 1903 due to its larger size and shorter ear. \n\"...in those days only those dogs up to a hard day\u2019s work and sensible specimens were allowed to live, as absolute sporting purposes were about their only enjoyment and dog shows were hardly heard of...\".The sport of conformation showing began in earnest among spaniels after the Spaniel Club was formed in 1885. When showing, the new Springer and Cocker, both were in the same class until The Spaniel Club created breed standards for each of the types. The Kennel Club separated the two types eight years later. Since then, the Springer and Cocker enthusiasts have bred in the separate traits that they desired. Today, the breed differ in more ways than weight alone.\nAt Crufts, the English Cocker Spaniel has been the most successful breed in winning Best in Show, winning on a total of seven occasions between 1928 and 2009, with wins in 1930, 1931, 1938, 1939, 1948, 1950 and 1996. In addition, the breed make up three of the four winners who have won the title on more than one occasion with all three coming from H.S. Lloyd's Ware kennel. Due to World War II, the English Cocker Spaniel managed to be the only breed to have won the title between 1938 and 1950, although the competition was only held on four occasions during that period. The most recent best in show was Sh. Ch. Canigou Cambrai in 1996.\n\n\n=== Field Spaniel ===\nIn the late 19th century with the increase in popularity of dog shows and the creation of standards for various breeds, the Spaniel family began to split into various different breeds. A group of enthusiasts decided to create a large black spaniel breed. Four dogs would act as progenitors for this new breed, of which two were Cocker Spaniels, one was a Cocker Spaniel/English Water Spaniel cross and one was a Norfolk Spaniel. This new breed was named the Field Spaniel, and was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1892.\n\n\n=== American Cocker Spaniel ===\n\nThe American Cocker Spaniel was developed from the English Cocker Spaniel in the 19th century to retrieve quail and woodcock. They were originally divided from the English Cocker solely on a size basis, but were bred over the years for different specific traits. The two Cocker Spaniels were shown together in America until 1936, when the English Cocker received status as a separate breed. The American Kennel Club granted a separate breed designation for the English Cocker Spaniel in 1946.\nThe American breed has a shorter snout, is more likely to get ear infections, and is groomed differently from the English Cocker.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe English Cocker Spaniel is a sturdy, compact, well-balanced dog. It has a characteristic expression showing intelligence and alertness. Its eyes should be dark and its lobular ears should reach \"a bit past\" the tip of the nose when pulled forward. Today, a significant difference in appearance exists between field-bred and conformation show-bred dogs. The Cocker's tail is customarily docked in North America. In countries where docking is legal, the tail is generally docked at about 4\u20135 inches (10\u201313 cm) in field-bred dogs while show dogs are generally docked closer to the body. Docking is now illegal in Australia and South Africa. In England and Wales, docking can only be carried out on dogs where the owners have proved that the dogs will be used as working or shooting dogs.The breed standard indicates that the males of the breed are on average between 15.5 and 16 inches (39 and 41 cm) at the withers with the females a little smaller, growing to between 15 and 15.5 inches (38 and 39 cm). Both males and females of the breed weigh approximately 13\u201314.5 kilograms (29\u201332 lb). American Cocker Spaniels are smaller, with the males being on average between 14.25 and 15.5 inches (36.2 and 39.4 cm), and females again being smaller on average at between 13.5 and 14.5 inches (34 and 37 cm), both weighing approximately 11\u201313 kilograms (24\u201329 lb). The closely related English Springer Spaniels are larger than either types of cockers, growing to between 19 and 19.75 inches (48.3 and 50.2 cm) for the females, and 19.25 and 20 inches (48.9 and 50.8 cm) for the males, and weighing between 23 and 25 kilograms (51 and 55 lb).The English Cocker Spaniel is similar to the English Springer Spaniel and at first glance the only major difference is the larger size of the Springer. However English Cockers also tend to have longer, and lower-set ears than English Springers. In addition Springers also tend to have a longer muzzle, their eyes are not as prominent and the coat is less abundant.\n\n\n=== Colour ===\n\nBreed standards restrict all breeds of dogs to certain colours for the purposes of conformation showing (dependent on country.)  For example, the breed standard of the United Kingdom's Kennel Club states that in solid colours, no white is allowed except for a small amount on the chest. In working Cockers, breeders value working ability over the color of the dog.\nThey come in solid (or \"self\"), parti-coloured, and roan types of markings. Solid dogs have no or very little white. Parti-coloured dogs have spots or patches of colour on a white dog. Parti-coloured dogs can have freckles of color on their nose and legs called \"ticking.\"  Roan is an extreme version of ticking and consists of the white dog parts of a dog being speckled with the same colour as the solid patches. Roan puppies are born white with coloured patches and the white becomes roan as they grow up, similar to the spots on Dalmations.\nSolid English Cocker colours are can come in black, liver/brown,  red/golden with black or brown pigmentation,  and Parti-coloured cockers come in blue roan, liver roan, orange roan with black or brown pigmentation, lemon roan with black or brown pigmentation, black and white ticked, liver and white ticked, orange and white ticked with black or brown pigmentation, lemon and white ticked with black or brown pigmentation, black and white, liver and white with brown pigmentation, orange and white with black or brown pigmentation, lemon and white with black or brown pigmentation. All of these colors can also have Tan-points, although you probably won't see it on any red, gold, or lemon Cocker because it will blend in. \nOf the solid colours, sable is considered rare and controversial, and is classified by some countries as being a type of particolour on account of its mixed hair shafts. While some have claimed this colour is from a cross with a different breed, geneticists have discovered English Cocker sable is unique to this breed.  In addition, a silver/ash colour, usually associated with the Weimaraner breed of dog, is considered genetically possible but is yet to be recorded by the United Kingdom's Kennel Club. Of the roan varieties, lemon roan with a light brown pigmentation is the most recessive of all the roans. Plain white Cockers are rarely born, and are thought to be more prone to deafness than those with more pigmentation. As such they are generally not encouraged in the breed.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nCockers are compassionate, determined, kind, intelligent, athletic, alert and resilient and make great family pets. The breed does not like being alone, and will bond strongly to an individual person in a family, usually the one who feeds it. Known for optimism, intelligence and adaptability, the breed is extremely loyal and affectionate. The English Cocker Spaniel has a cheerful nature. They rank 18th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of excellent working/obedience intelligence.\nDue to the breed's happy disposition and continuously wagging tail, it has been given the nickname \"merry cocker\". They can also be dominant but loyal to their companion.\nWith a good level of socialisation at an early age, Cocker Spaniels can get along well with people, children, other dogs and other pets. This breed seems to have a perpetually wagging tail and prefers to be around people; it is not best suited to the backyard alone. Cockers can be easily stressed by loud noises and by rough treatment or handling. When trained with a soft hand and with lots of rewards, the Cocker Spaniel will be an obedient and loving companion with a happy, cheerful nature.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nEnglish Cocker Spaniels in UK and USA/Canada have an average lifespan of 11 to 12 years, which is a typical longevity for purebred dogs, but a little less than most other breeds of their size.\nThe English Cocker Spaniel typically lives about a year longer than the smaller American Cocker Spaniel.In a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (30%), old age (17%), cardiac (9%), and \"combinations\" (7%).In 1998 and 2002 USA/Canada Health Surveys, the leading causes of death were old age (40%) and cancer (22%).Common health issues with English Cockers are bite problems, skin allergies, shyness, cataracts, deafness (affecting 6.3% of the dogs of this breed), aggression towards other dogs, and benign tumours.Some uncommon health issues that can also have an effect on English Cocker Spaniels include canine hip dysplasia, patellar lunation, canine dilated cardiomyopathy, and heart murmurs. Hip dysplasia is an abnormal formation of the hip joint which is the most common cause of canine arthritis in the hips. Patellar Lunation, also known as luxating patella, refers to the dislocation of the kneecap. Canine dilated cardiomyopathy is an adult onset condition which occurs when the heart muscle is weak and does not contract properly. It can lead to congestive heart failure, which is where fluid accumulates in the lungs, chest, abdominal cavities, or under the skin. Dilated cardiomyopathy is often accompanied by abnormal heart rhythms, or arrhythmias which can complicate treatment.\n\n\n=== Rage syndrome ===\nRage syndrome is most often associated with the Show Cocker Spaniel breed, although cases have been found in other breeds and cases are relatively rare even within the Cocker Spaniel breed. Rage syndrome is described as when a dog attacks suddenly and often savagely, without any warning and during the attack the dog often has a glazed look and appears to be unaware of its surroundings. Rage Syndrome can affect any and all breeds. Though not a common ailment, studies have found it is more common in solid coloured Cockers than in particolours and also more common in darker coloured Cockers than lighter coloured Cockers, being most common in solid gold and black coloured spaniels. Their health issues are typical for a purebred dog breed; however they are closely associated with rage syndrome even though cases are really quite rare. Rage syndrome cannot be accurately predicted and can only be diagnosed by EEG or genetic testing and these tests are not conclusive.A link between coat colour and temperament has been proposed. This link could be the colour pigment melanin, which is biochemically similar to chemicals that act as transmitters in the brain. A study made by the University of Cambridge involving over 1,000 Cocker Spaniel households throughout Britain concluded that solid colour Cockers were more likely to be aggressive in 12 out of 13 situations. Red/golden Cockers were shown to be the most aggressive of all, in situations involving strangers, family members, while being disciplined, and sometimes for no apparent reason. \nA study by Spanish researchers at the Autonomous University of Barcelona revealed a similar link between golden Cockers and aggression. Males were also more likely to be aggressive. The study found the English Cocker Spaniel to have the highest level of owner- and stranger- directed aggression compared to other breeds.\n\n\n== Working Cockers ==\n\nThis breed, like many others with origins as working dogs, has some genetic lines that focus on working-dog skills and other lines that focus on ensuring that the dog's appearance conforms to a breed standard; these are referred to as the \"working\" (or \"field-bred\") and \"conformation\" strains, respectively. After World War II, Cocker Spaniels bred for pets and for the sport of conformation showing increased enormously in popular appeal, and, for a while, was the most numerous Kennel Club registered breed. This popularity increased the view that all Cockers were useless as working dogs. However, for most dogs this is untrue, as even some show-bred Cockers have retained their working instinct.Today, this breed is experiencing a resurgence in usage as a working and hunting dog. Dogs from working lines are noticeably distinct in appearance. As is the case with the English Springer Spaniel, the working type has been bred exclusively to perform in the field as a hunting companion. Their coat is shorter and ears less pendulous than the show-bred type. Although registered as the same breed, the two strains have diverged significantly enough that they are rarely crossed. The dogs that have dominated the hunt test, field trial and hunting scene in the United States are field-bred dogs from recently imported English lines. Working-dog lines often have physical characteristics that would prevent them from winning in the show ring. This is a result of selecting for different traits than those selected by show breeders. The longer coat and ears, selected for the show ring, are an impediment in the field. Cuban authorities train and use English Cocker Spaniels as sniffer dogs to check for drugs or food products in passengers' baggage at Cuban airports.\n\n\n=== Skills ===\nA field-bred cocker spaniel is first and foremost an upland flushing dog. In performing this task there are some skills the dog must be trained to perform.\nHup This is the traditional command to sit and stay. To be an effective hunter the dog must comply with this command absolutely. When hupped the dog can be given direction called to the handler. The ability to hup a dog actively working a running bird allow the handler and any gunners to keep up without having to run.\nRetrieve to Hand The majority of hunters and all hunt test or field trial judges require that a dog deliver a bird to hand, meaning that a dog will hold the bird until told to give it to the hunter directly.\nQuarter Dogs must work in a pattern in front of the hunter seeking upland game birds. The dog must be taught to stay within gun range to avoid flushing a bird outside of shooting distance.\nFollow Hand Signals Upland hunting involves pursuing wild game in its native habitat. Gun dogs must investigate likely covers for upland game birds. The dog must be responsive to hand signals in order for the hunter to be able to direct the dog into areas of particular interest.\nSteady When hunting upland birds, a flushing dog should be steady to wing and shot, meaning that he sits when a bird rises or a gun is fired. He does this in order to mark the fall and to avoid flushing other birds when pursuing a missed bird.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\nPrince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge own an English Cocker Spaniel called Lupo, and Lupo was bred from Ella, a dog owned by her parents Michael and Carole Middleton. He is a working-type English Cocker Spaniel. Lupo was born in a litter just prior to Christmas 2011, and was given to Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, who at first denied owning the dog to the media.Following the birth of Prince George of Cambridge, Lupo was featured in one of the first official photographs. He was subsequently featured in a family portrait with the Duke and Duchess and Prince George in March 2014. He has travelled with his owners to their holiday residence in Norfolk, but did not travel with them on their tour of Australia and New Zealand in 2014.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nThoms, Jerry. \"Emma is a Gun Dog (Cocker Size)\".

It is a cousin of the American Foxhound. They are scent hounds, bred to hunt foxes by scent.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe breed standards' guidelines for showing English Foxhounds requires them to be 21\u201325 inches (53\u201364 cm) tall at the withers. The skull is wide and the muzzle is long. The legs are muscular, straight-boned, and the paws are rounded, almost cat-like. The English Foxhound comes in any hound color, most often tricolor, tan, red, or black with a white base.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe English Foxhound is a pack hound, therefore, it gets along well with other dogs and enjoys human companionship. It gets along with horses, children, and other pets, as it is a gentle, social, and tolerant breed. It is an active breed that enjoys tracking foxes and has the stamina to run all day with few breaks.\n\n\n== Health and lifespan ==\nThere are very few health problems in this breed. Occasionally seen are chronic hip dysplasia, renal disease, and epilepsy. The breed's lifespan is typically 10\u201313 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe English Foxhound was created in the late 16th century, as a result of the perception of the depletion of deer in England. Nobles and royalty had hunted deer for both food and sport, using the Deerhound or Staghound for this purpose. During the reign of Henry VIII, it was perceived that a new prey was needed, and the fox was selected. The English Foxhound was then created by a careful mixing of the Greyhound, for speed, the Fox Terrier, for hunting instinct, and the Bulldog, for tenacity in the hunt.\nDuring the British Raj, English Foxhounds were exported to India for the purpose of jackal coursing, though due to the comparatively hotter weather, they were rarely long lived. Foxhounds were preferred for this purpose over greyhounds, as the former was not as fast, and could thus provide a longer, more sporting chase.Studbooks for the English foxhound have been kept since the 18th century. Breeding lines and the work of people involved in breeding hounds is extremely important in the continual development of this working breed. Puppy shows are important events in the hunting calendar and allow the local hunt followers and visiting hound breeders examine the latest generation from the hound pack. The International Foxhound Association was created in 2012 for the promotion of the English Foxhound as a breed.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEnglish Foxhound at Curlie"}, {"id": 180, "name": "English Mastiff", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog180", "description": "The English Mastiff is a breed of extremely large dog (often known simply as the Mastiff) perhaps descended from the ancient Alaunt and Pugnaces Britanniae, with a significant input from the Alpine Mastiff in the 19th century. Distinguished by its enormous size, massive head, short coat in a limited range of colours, and always displaying a black mask, the Mastiff is noted for its gentle and loving nature. The lineage of modern dogs can be traced back to the early 19th century, but the modern type was stabilised in the 1880s and refined since. Following a period of sharp decline, the Mastiff has increased its worldwide popularity.  Throughout its history the Mastiff has contributed to the development of a number of dog breeds, some generally known as Mastiff-type dogs, or, confusingly, just as \"Mastiffs\".\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nWith a massive body, broad skull and head of generally square appearance, it is the largest dog breed in terms of mass. It is on average slightly heavier than the Saint Bernard, although there is a considerable mass overlap between these two breeds. Though the Irish Wolfhound and Great Dane can be more than six inches taller, they are not nearly as rotund.The body is large with great depth and breadth, especially between the forelegs\u2014which causes these to be set wide apart. The length of the body taken from the point of the shoulder to the point of the buttock is greater than the height at the withers. The AKC standard height (per their website) for this breed is 30 inches (76 cm) at the shoulder for males and 27.5 inches (70 cm) (minimum) at the shoulder for females. A typical male can weigh 150\u2013250 pounds (68\u2013113 kg), a typical female can weigh 120\u2013200 pounds (54\u201391 kg), with very large individuals reaching 130 kg (286 lb) or more.\n\n\n=== Coat colour standards ===\nThe former standard specified the coat should be short and close-lying. Long haired Mastiffs, known as \"Fluffies\", are caused by a recessive gene\u2014they are occasionally seen, but this trait is not accepted by any kennel club. English Mastiff colours are apricot-fawn, silver-fawn, fawn, or dark fawn-brindle, always with black on the muzzle, ears, and nose and around the eyes. \nThe colours of the Mastiff coat are differently described by various kennel clubs, but are essentially fawn or apricot, or those colours as a base for black brindle. A black mask should occur in all cases. The fawn is generally a light \"silver\" shade, but may range up to a golden yellow. The apricot may be a slightly reddish hue up to a deep, rich red. The brindle markings should ideally be heavy, even and clear stripes, but may actually be light, uneven, patchy, faint or muddled. Pied Mastiffs occur rarely. Other non-standard colours include black, blue brindle, and chocolate (brown) mask. Some Mastiffs have a heavy shading caused by dark hairs throughout the coat or primarily on the back and shoulders. This is not generally considered a fault. Brindle is dominant over solid colour. Apricot is dominant over fawn, though that dominance may be incomplete. Most of the colour faults are recessive, though black is so rare in the Mastiff that it has never been determined whether the allele is recessive or a mutation that is dominant.\n\nThe genetic basis for the variability of coat in dogs has been much studied, but all the issues have not yet been resolved. On the basis of what is known (and remembering that, as dogs are diploid animals, each gene location (locus) appears twice in every animal, so questions of dominance also must be resolved), the gene possibilities allowed by the Mastiff standard are AyBDEmh(kbr_or_ky)mS. This describes a dog which is fawn with a dark nose, non-dilute, black-masked, non-harlequin, brindled or not brindled, non-merle, and non-spotted. To allow for the rare exceptions we must include \"b\" (brown mask and possible brown brindling), \"d\" (blue mask and possible blue brindling), \"sp\" (pied spotting), and perhaps \"a\" (recessive black). The possible combination of homozygous brown and homozygous blue is a pale brown referred to as isabella in breeds where it is relatively common. On a Mastiff, this would appear on mask, ears, and any brindling that was present. Speculative gene locations may also exist, so a Mastiff may be \"I\" (apricot) or \"i\" (non-apricot) and perhaps \"cch\" (silver lightening) or \"C\" (without silver lightening). (Note that this \"C locus\" may not be the same as the one identified in other animals, SLC45A2.)\n\n\n=== Record size ===\nThe greatest weight ever recorded for a dog, 343 pounds (155.6 kg), was that of an English Mastiff\nfrom England named Aicama Zorba of La Susa, although claims of larger dogs, including Saint Bernards, Tibetan Mastiffs, and Caucasian ovcharkas exist. According to the 1989 edition of the Guinness Book of Records, in March 1989, when he was 7 years old, Zorba stood 37 inches (94 cm) at the shoulder and was 8 ft 3 in (251 cm) from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail, about the size of a small donkey. After 2000, the Guinness Book of World Records stopped accepting largest or heaviest pet records.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Mastiff breed has a desired temperament, which is reflected in all formal standards and historical descriptions.\nSydenham Edwards wrote in 1800 in the Cynographia Britannica:\n\nWhat the Lion is to the Cat the Mastiff is to the Dog, the noblest of the family; he stands alone, and all others sink before him. His courage does not exceed his temper and generosity, and in attachment he equals the kindest of his race. His docility is perfect; the teazing of the smaller kinds will hardly provoke him to resent, and I have seen him down with his paw the Terrier or cur that has bit him, without offering further injury. In a family he will permit the children to play with him, and suffer all their little pranks without offence. The blind ferocity of the Bull Dog will often wound the hand of the master who assists him to combat, but the Mastiff distinguishes perfectly, enters the field with temper, and engages in the attack as if confident of success: if he overpowers, or is beaten, his master may take him immediately in his arms and fear nothing. This ancient and faithful domestic, the pride of our island, uniting the useful, the brave and the docile, though sought by foreign nations and perpetuated on the continent, is nearly extinct where he probably was an aborigine, or is bastardized by numberless crosses, everyone of which degenerate from the invaluable character of the parent, who was deemed worthy to enter the Roman amphitheatre, and, in the presence of the masters of the worlds, encounter the pard, and assail even the lord of the savage tribes, whose courage was sublimed by torrid suns, and found none gallant enough to oppose him on the deserts of Zaara or the plains of Numidia.\nThe American Kennel Club sums up the Mastiff breed as:\n\na combination of grandeur and good nature as well as courage and docility. Domesticated Mastiffs are powerful yet gentle and loyal dogs, but due to their physical size and need for space, are best suited for country or suburban life.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThe Mastiff should at all stages of development show the breed characteristics of massiveness and sound, if cumbersome, movement.\nThe Mastiff is a particularly large dog demanding correct diet and exercise. Excessive running is not recommended for the first two years of the dog's life, in order not to damage the growth plates in the joints of this heavy and fast-growing dog, which in some weeks may gain over 5 lb. However, regular exercise must be maintained throughout the dog's life to discourage slothful behaviour and to prevent a number of health problems. A soft surface is recommended for the dog to sleep on to prevent the development of calluses, arthritis, and hygroma (an acute inflammatory swelling). Due to the breed's large size, puppies may potentially be smothered or crushed by the mother during nursing.  A whelping box, along with careful monitoring can prevent such accidents.  The average lifespan of the Mastiff is about 7 years although it's not uncommon for some to live to 10\u201311 years.Major problems can include hip dysplasia and gastric torsion. Minor problems include obesity, osteosarcoma, and cystinuria. Problems only occasionally found include cardiomyopathy, allergies, vaginal hyperplasia, cruciate ligament rupture, hypothyroidism, OCD, entropion, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), and persistent pupillary membranes (PPM).\nWhen purchasing a purebred Mastiff, experts often suggest that the dog undergo tests for hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, thyroid, and DNA for PRA.\nA Mastiff may be kept in an apartment, but care must be taken to give it enough exercise. Mastiffs should be fed 2 or 3 times a day; it is believed that one large meal per day can increase the chance of gastric torsion.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== From ancient times to the early nineteenth century ===\nThe large dogs depicted in figurines and in bas-reliefs from the sixth century BC in Assyria during the reign of King Ashurbanipal may have some part in the ancestry of modern Mastiffs, but without genetic evidence or a clear historical link, this is speculative. There is a similar figurine from the same region during the Kassite period almost a thousand years earlier. These dogs may be related to the dogs that fought lions, tigers, bears, and gladiators in Roman arenas.Certainly an element in the formation of the English Mastiff was the Pugnaces Britanniae that existed at the time of the Roman conquest of Britain. The ancient Roman poet Grattius (or Grattius Faliscus) wrote of British dogs, describing them as superior to the ancient Greek Molossus, saying:\n\nWhat if you choose to penetrate even among the Britons? How great your reward, how great your gain beyond any outlays! If you are not bent on looks and deceptive graces (this is the one defect of the British whelps), at any rate when serious work has come, when bravery must be shown, and the impetuous War-god calls in the utmost hazard, then you could not admire the renowned Molossians so much.\nThe turn-of-the-millennium Greek historian Strabo reported that dogs were exported from Britain for the purpose of game hunting, and that these dogs were also used by the Celts as war dogs. As far as the origin of the Pugnaces Britanniae is concerned, there is unproven speculation that they were descended from dogs brought to Britain by the Phoenicians in the 6th century BC.The Alaunt is likely to have been another genetic predecessor to the English Mastiff. Introduced by the Normans, these dogs were developed by the Alans, who had migrated into France (then known as Gaul) due to pressure by the Huns at the start of the fifth century. Intriguingly they were known from the Romans to live in a region (the Pontic-Caspian Steppe) about 700 km to the north of the region where the Assyrians once lived. Again, any canine connections are speculative.The linguistic origin of the name \"Mastiff\" is unclear.  Many claim that it evolved from the Anglo-Saxon word \"masty\", meaning \"powerful\". Other sources, such as the Oxford English Dictionary, say the word originated from the Old French word mastin (Modern French m\u00e2tin), the word being itself derived from Vulgar Latin *ma(n)suetinus \"tame\", see Classical Latin mansuetus with same meaning. The first list of dog breed names in the English language, contained within The Book of Saint Albans, published in 1465, includes \"Mastiff \". This work is attributed to Prioress Juliana Berners, but in part may be translated from the early 14th century Norman-French work Le Art de Venerie, by Edward II's Huntmaster Guillaume Twici.\n In 1570, Conrad Heresbach, in Rei Rusticae Libri Quatuor, referred to \"the Mastie that keepeth the house\". Heresbach was writing in Latin; his work was translated a few years later into English by Barnabe Googe as Foure Bookes of Husbandrie. This work is adapted from De Re Rustica by 1st century Roman writer Columella, which highlights the Roman connection.   Certainly from Roman to Medieval times, Mastiff-like dogs were used in the blood sports of bear-baiting, bull-baiting, lion-baiting, and dog fighting, as well as for hunting and guarding.  Dogs known as Bandogs, who were tied (bound) close to houses, were of Mastiff type.They were described by John Caius in 1570 as vast, huge, stubborn, ugly, and eager, of a heavy and burdensome body.\nThe naturalist Christopher Merret in his 1666 work  Pinax Rerum Naturalium Brittanicarum has a list of British mammals, including 15 kinds of dog, one of which is \"Molossus, Canis bellicosus Anglicus, a Mastif\". Literally, \"Molossus, warlike English dog, a Mastiff\", and perhaps the first conflation of the breeds Molossus and Mastiff.\n\nWhen in 1415 Sir Peers Legh was wounded in the Battle of Agincourt, his Mastiff stood over and protected him for many hours through the battle.  The Mastiff was later returned to Legh's home and was the foundation of the Lyme Hall Mastiffs.  Five centuries later this pedigree figured prominently in founding the modern breed. Other aristocratic seats where Mastiffs are known to have been kept are Elvaston Castle (Charles Stanhope, 4th Earl of Harrington and his ancestors) and Chatsworth House. The owner of the Chatsworth Mastiffs (which were said to be of Alpine Mastiff stock) was William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, known to his family as Canis. Mastiffs were also kept at Hadzor Hall, owned by members of the Galton family, famous for industrialists and scientists, including Charles Darwin. Some evidence exists that the Mastiff first came to America on the Mayflower, but the breed's further documented entry to America did not occur until the late 19th century.\n\n\n=== From the early nineteenth century to the First World War ===\nIn 1835, the Parliament of the United Kingdom implemented an Act called the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, which prohibited the baiting of animals. This may have led to decline in the aggressive Mastiffs used for this purpose, but Mastiffs continued to be used as guards for country estates and town businesses.\nSystematic breeding began in the 19th century, when J.W. (John Wigglesworth) Thompson purchased a bitch, Dorah, from John Crabtree, the head gamekeeper of Kirklees Hall, whose dogs were often held in the name of his employer, Sir George Armitage. Dorah was descended in part from animals owned by Thompson's grandfather Commissioner Thompson at the beginning of the century, as well as a Mastiff of the Bold Hall line (recorded from 1705), a bitch purchased from canal boat men, another caught by Crabtree in a fox trap, a dog from Nostal priory and another dog from Walton Hall, owned by the naturalist, Charles Waterton. J. W. Thompson's first stud dog, Hector, came from crossing a bitch, Juno, bought from animal dealer Bill George, to a dog, Tiger, owned by a Captain Fenton. Neither of these had any pedigree, as was normal for the period. Between 1830 and 1850 he bred the descendants of these dogs and some others to produce a line with the short, broad head and massive build he favoured. In 1835, T.V.H. Lukey started his operations by breeding an Alpine Mastiff bitch of the Chatsworth line, Old Bob-Tailed Countess (bought from dog dealer Bill White), to Pluto, a large black Mastiff of unknown origin belonging to the Marquis of Hertford. The result was a bitch called Yarrow, who was mated to Couchez, another Alpine Mastiff belonging (at the time) to White and later mated to a brindle dog also in White's possession. Lukey produced animals that were taller but less massive than Thompson's. After 1850, Thompson and Lukey collaborated, and the modern Mastiff was created, though animals without pedigree or of dubious pedigree continued to be bred from into the 20th century.\n\nAnother important contribution to the breed was made by a dog called Lion, owned by Captain (later Colonel) John Garnier of The Royal Engineers. He bought two Mastiffs from the previously mentioned dealer Bill George. The bitch, Eve, bought by George at Leadenhall Market, was old enough to be grey-muzzled, but of good type. The dog, Adam, was of reputed Lyme Hall origin, but bought at Tattersalls and suspected by Garnier of containing a \"dash of Boarhound\", an ancestral form of Great Dane. Garnier took them with him when he was posted to Canada and brought back their puppy, Lion. He was bred to Lukey's Countess to produce Governor, the source of all existing male Mastiff lines. (Lion was also mated to Lufra, a Scottish Deerhound, and their puppy Marquis appears in the pedigrees of both Deerhounds and Irish Wolfhounds.) In the 1880s soundness was sacrificed for type, which was widely attributed to the short-headed, massive, but straight-stifled and chocolate-masked Ch. Crown Prince. This dog dominated all of his contemporaries in terms of the number of offspring. Subsequently, the Mastiff lost popularity but gained a consistency of type, with leaner, longer-headed specimens becoming relatively less common. Prominent among the breeders of this era who began to restore soundness were Edgar Hanbury and his relation, the politician and philanthropist Mark Hanbury Beaufoy, later Chairman of The Kennel Club, who reaching his peak as a breeder with the Crown Prince grandson, Ch. Beaufort, eventually exported to America. Despite such imports, Mastiff numbers in the US declined steadily through the 1890s and the early 20th century. From 1906 to 1918, only 24 Mastiffs were registered in the United States. After 1910, none of these were bred in America. By the time the First World War ended, other than a few exports to North America, the breed was extinct outside of Great Britain.\n\n\n=== After the First World War ===\nIn 1918, a dog called Beowulf, bred in Canada from British imports Priam of Wingfied and Parkgate Duchess, was registered by the American Kennel Club, starting a slow re-establishment of the breed in North America. Priam and Duchess, along with fellow imports Ch Weland, Thor of the Isles, Caractacus of Hellingly and Brutus of Saxondale, ultimately contributed a total of only two descendants who would produce further offspring: Buster of Saxondale and Buddy. There were, however, a number of other imports in the period between the wars and in the early days of the Second World War Those who can still be found in modern pedigrees were 12 in number, meaning the North American contribution to the gene pool after 1945 (including Buster and Buddy) consisted of 14 Mastiffs.\nIn the British Isles during the Second World War virtually all Mastiff breeding stopped due to the rationing of meat. After the war, such puppies as were produced mostly succumbed to canine distemper, for which no vaccine was developed until 1950. Only a single bitch puppy produced by the elderly stock that survived the war reached maturity, Nydia of Frithend. Her sire had to be declared a Mastiff by the Kennel Club, as his parentage was unknown, and he was thought by some to be a Bullmastiff.\nAfter the war, animals from North America (predominantly from Canada) were imported into Britain. Therefore, all Mastiffs in the late 1950s were descended from Nydia and the 14 Mastiffs previously mentioned, with each all-male bloodline going back to Ch. Crown Prince. It has been alleged that the Mastiff was bred with other more numerically significant giant breeds such as Bullmastiffs and St. Bernards, with the justification that these were considered close relatives to the Mastiff. In 1959, a Dogue de Bordeaux, Fidelle de Fenelon, was imported from France to the USA, registered as a Mastiff, and became the 16th animal in the post-war gene pool. Since that time, the breed has gradually been restored in Britain, has reached 28th most popular breed in the USA, and is now found worldwide.\n\n\n== Famous Mastiffs ==\n\"Carlo\" from \"The Adventure of the Copper Beeches\", a Sherlock Holmes story\n\"Chupadogra\" A.K.A. \"Buster\" is an elderly English Mastiff, voiced by Sam Elliott from in the 2010 film, Marmaduke.\n\"Crown Prince\", progenitor of the modern breed, owned by psychiatrist L.

It is part of the setter group, which includes the red Irish Setters, Irish Red and White Setters, and black-and-tan Gordon Setters. The mainly white body coat is of medium length with long silky fringes on the back of the legs, under the belly and on the tail. The coat features flecks of colour, and the different colour varieties are referred to as belton.\nA gentle but at times strong-willed, mischievous gun dog, bred for a mix of endurance and athleticism, it is used to hunt for game such as quail, pheasant and grouse. When working, the dog will hunt methodically seeking the airborne scent of its prey. It is sometimes referred to as the Laverack or Llewellin Setter as these were famous strains of the breed during the major development period in the 19th century. Those from hunting stock are generally of a finer build and with less coat than those bred for show exhibition.\nGenerally reasonably healthy, they have an average life span of 11 to 12 years. The Kennel Club advises UK breeders to screen for hip dysplasia.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe English Setter is a medium-sized dog which should have an elegant overall appearance. Its size can range from 24 inches (61 cm) for females up to 27 inches (69 cm) for males. The field or hunting type can be finer in build and construction than those from bench or show lines. The breed was designed to hunt game such as quail, pheasant, and grouse so should be able to cover a lot of ground when seeking the airborne scent of the birds, carrying its head high. The head should be slightly domed with a muzzle of good depth and show chiselling under the eyes, which should be dark in colour with a kind, gentle expression. The top of the ears (sometimes the ears are referred to as \"leathers\") are positioned in line with the eyes and lie in an elegant fold. It has a long muscular neck, well angled shoulders and a brisket of good depth. The body is of a moderate length proportionate to its height and it has strong powerful hindquarters. It carries its tail in line with its back and the tail should be long enough to reach the hock.The main body coat is short to medium length, lies flat and has a silky texture. Long silky coat \u2013 usually called \"feathering\", forms fringes on the outside of the ears, neck, chest, down the back of the front legs, under the belly and on the back legs. The tail is also feathered with long coat.\nThe body coat and feathering should be straight and flat but not profuse and never curly although a slight wave can be seen.The bench or show type has a long, flowing coat that requires regular grooming. The field or hunting type has a shorter coat that requires less grooming.The base colour of the coat is white with differing coloured ticking also called flecks or speckling. The various speckled coat colours when occurring in English Setters are referred to as belton; valid combinations are white with black flecks (blue belton), white with orange flecks (orange belton), white with orange flecks and lighter nose (lemon belton), white with liver flecks (liver belton), or \"tricolour\", which is blue or liver belton with tan markings on the face, chest, and legs. The flecking should not form large patches on the body and the flecks should be distributed all over the body. The use of the word \"belton\" was first coined by Laverack, who developed the breed in the 19th-century, to describe his ideal for flecking and is also the name of a village in the extreme north of England. Puppies' coats may not have all the markings that they have as adults.\nEnglish Setter\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThis breed's standard temperament is best described as a \"Gentleman by Nature\". However, it can also be strong-willed and mischievous, especially if coming from working/field breeding lines. English Setters are energetic, people-oriented dogs, that are well suited to families who can give them attention and activity, or to working with a hunter, where they have a job to do. They are active dogs that need plenty of exercise and up to two hours a day of exercise is recommended. Inside they tend to be lower energy and love to be couch potatoes and lap dogs; the breed is described as \"intensely friendly,\" \"good natured,\" and \"adores visitors and is particularly happy with children.\"They rank 37th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of above average working/obedience intelligence. English Setters are very intelligent and can be trained to perform about any task another breed can do, with the exception of herding.  However, they are not always easy to train, as their natural bird instinct tends to distract them in outdoor environments. Their temperament is considered to be gentle and as English Setters can be very sensitive to criticism, positive reinforcement training methods using treats and praise work best when undertaking basic training.\n\n\n== Health ==\nDogs, both pedigree and cross breeds, can be affected with genetic problems. Those known to sometimes occur in English Setters can include congenital deafness, which was reported as affecting 12.4 percent of the 701 English Setters tested by the Louisiana State University in 2010. As at 2013, there has not been any detailed research on this condition undertaken in the UK; autoimmune thyroiditis, which was shown to affect 26.2 percent of 747 English Setters examined between January 1974 until December 2012 in an Orthopedic Foundation for Animals listing; canine hypothyroidism; elbow dysplasia; and allergies, which can include some sensitivity to certain food ingredients and also skin conditions, are known to occur.In 2004, the U.K. Kennel Club established the Accredited Breeders Scheme, which was later called the Assured Breeders Scheme (ABS). The scheme received UKAS accreditation in April 2013. ABS members are required to adhere to additional criteria than those necessary for basic KC registration. Among the extra requirements is \"Ensuring that the parents of each litter are readily identifiable by either Microchip, Tattoo or DNA profile.\" As at March 2013, breeders of English Setters who are members of the ABS must screen for hip dysplasia.Some members of the breed may be affected by cancer and this was identified as the most common cause of death of English Setters in a survey undertaken by the Kennel Club; the age of death from this disease was mainly after reaching ten years of age. However, the survey had only received a small response rate. Life expectancy is between 11 and 12 years, though 13 to 15 years is not uncommon.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nSetters hunt by ranging over large distances in a systematic, methodical manner, silently seeking game by scent. When prey is found by scenting the air, the dog will freeze rather than give chase. The dog will stop in a sort of crouch or \"set\" by freezing in a standing position upon finding their quarry and this distinctive stance is how the term \u201csetter\u201d evolved. Once the dog has indicated where the birds are by freezing on point, on command it would then slowly creep forward to disturb the birds into flight. Once the birds were in flight the hunter who had been following the dog would release hawks to capture the birds in the air. When netting superseded the use of hawks, setting dogs would still be used to indicate the whereabouts of the birds, but the hunter would come up behind the dog and throw a net over the birds. In the mid-1600s, guns became more readily available and shooting game birds became a popular pastime of the landed gentry. The basic work of setters was still to find and point to the location of game birds but it also had to be steady to shot.The scent of game birds is airborne so to pick up this scent the setter carries its head well up and should never follow foot scent. Most setters are born with a natural proclivity to hunting. Dogs that show excitement and interest in birds are described as being \"birdy\", and trainers look for puppies that show this particular trait. Training is usually done with quail as a first choice or domesticated pigeons.Writing in 1876, Arnold Burges described the \"pure-blooded English Setter\" as \"the best animal for American upland shooting\" in his book The American Kennel and Sporting Field.\n\n\n== Early history ==\n\"Setting dogges\" is an ancient term used for setters and the original purpose of the English Setter was to set or point upland game birds. From the best available information, it appears that the English Setter was a trained bird dog in England more than 400 years ago and there are works of art created in the early 15th century showing dogs that are discernible as being of a \u201csetter type\u201d. There is evidence that the English Setter originated in crosses of the Spanish Pointer, large Water Spaniel, and English Springer Spaniel, which combined to produce an excellent bird dog with a high degree of proficiency in finding and pointing game in open country.Writing in 1576, Dr Johannes Caius states: \"There is also at this date among us a new kind of dogge brought out of Fraunce, and they bee speckled all over with white and black, which mingled colours incline to a marble blewe\". Argue speculates this may be a description of the blue belton colour found in English Setters.Caius went on to describe the dog called a setter using the Latin name index:\n\nAnother sort of Dogges be there, serviceable for fowling, making no noise either with foote or with tongue, whiles they follow the game. They attend diligently upon their Master and frame their condition to such beckes, motions and gestures, as it shall please him to exhibite and make, either going forward, drawing backeward, inclinding to the right hand, or yealding toward the left. When he hath founde the byrde, he keepeth sure and fast silence, he stayeth his steppes and wil proceede no further, and weth a close, covert watching eye, layeth his belly to the grounde and so creepth forward like a worme. When he approaches neere to the place where the byrde is, he layes him downe, and with a marcke of his pawes, betrayeth the place of the byrdes last abode, whereby it is supposed that this kind of dogge is calles in Index, Setter, being in deede a name most consonant and agreeable to his quality.\nBy the 17th century setters, or \"setting dogges\", had become established and were widespread on British estates, although the evolution into the more specific individual breeds of setters occurred at a later date. The interbreeding of the different colours was still taking place during this period but it gradually changed and sportsman/breeders began to segregate matings to dogs adapted to the terrain it was required to work on.\n\n\n== Breed development ==\nThe modern English Setter owes its appearance to Edward Laverack (1800\u20131877), who developed his own strain of the breed by careful breeding during the 19th century in England and to another Englishman, R. Purcell Llewellin (1840\u20131925), who founded his strain using Laverack's best dogs and outcrossed them with the Duke, Rhoebe and later Duke's littermate Kate bloodlines with the best results.\n\nHistorically, many dogs descending from the same bloodline were referred to by the name of their breeder or owner and the nomenclatures \"Laverack Setter\" and \"LLewellin Setter\" describe English Setters bred by Laverack and Llewellin. Horace Lytle, one time gundog editor of Field & Stream, author and a well-known gundog trainer, clarified this in the book \"How to train your bird dog\", which he wrote in 1928:\n\nAnother tremendous uncertainty exists among the widest possible class of hunters with reference to the so-called Llewellin Setters. Llewellin Setters are nothing more \u2013 and nothing less \u2013 than English Setters. Llewellin Setters are simply English Setters that trace back to two particular English Setters. They represent a certain definite English Setter ancestry. That's all there is to it. Thus an English Setter may not always be a \"Llewellin\"; but a \"Llewellin\" is always an English Setter. Furthermore, the craze for this particular strain that came to this country with the importation of the first \"Llewellins\" caused ninety per cent of the owners of all Setters that are not either distinctly Irish or Gordon, to refer to their dogs as \"Llewellins\". Yet in ninety per cent of these cases, the dogs so referred to are not of the Llewellin strain at all. Not one person in a hundred who owns an English Setter can tell even from the pedigree whether the dog is of the Llewellin strain or not. They simply don't know. Most of those who refer to their Setters as \"Llewellins\" do so because the name is rather euphonious and pleasing to pronounce. Many of those who really do know, insist that their Llewellins be one hundred per cent, and they refer to those that are not as \"grades\". If there is even as little as 3 per cent \"outcross,\" these few are inclined to feel that the dog is nothing but a rank plebeian. All of which is really ridiculous \u2013 at least so think a good many of us who have thought the matter out.\n\nAround 1826, Reverend A Harrison of Carlisle in Cumbria sold a male dog called \"Ponto\" and a female named \"Old Moll\" to Laverack and this pair formed the foundation of his English Setters. Laverack did not know the exact pedigree of these dogs but maintained the strain had been pure-bred for the previous thirty-five years. Laverack closely inbred to these two dogs for generations and his bloodline was successful in dog shows and as a working dog in field trials.In 1874, C. H. Raymond from Morris Plains, New Jersey imported the first English Setter from the Laverack bloodline to America. The working setter Count Noble descended from these early imports and is commemorated in the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.\nLlewellin's strain was based on Laverack's best dogs, which were then outcrossed with the bloodlines of his dogs Duke, Rhoebe and later Duke's littermate, Kate. It was Kate bred with Laverack's best hunting males that produced Llewellin's ideals Fd.Ch.Ch. Armstrong's Dash II and later Fd.Ch.Ch Dashing Bondhu. They were the foundation of Llewellin's personal strain known as \"Dashing Bondhu\". William Humphrey (1882\u20131963) inherited them from Llewellin in 1925 and continued them pure until his death in 1963.Jim the Wonder Dog, described as a Llewellin setter, was said to have  \"possessed an occult power\" and there is a bronze statue of him in a memorial garden on the square in Marshall, Missouri, built to commemorate him.\n\n\n== In competitions ==\nThe field type and show type English Setter look very different, even though they are the same breed.  Field type setters are often smaller and are seen with less feathering and usually more distinctive spotting than show type setters.  Both traits are beneficial in the field: less feathering makes getting burs out of their coat easier and the spotting makes them easier to see in the field.\n\nEnglish Setters are classified within the gundog group in the UK and the Sporting group in America and Canada. The FCI place them in section 2, British and Irish Pointers and Setters, of Group 7.In the English Setter breed, compared to other breeds, there are very few Dual Champions. The Kennel Club have four champion titles available to be achieved by setters competing in the UK. These are Show Champion (Sh Ch) which is awarded to dogs who have won three Challenge Certificates (CCs) under three different judges with at least one CC won after 12 months of age; Champion (Ch) is the title gained by dogs who have won a Sh Ch title plus a field trial award, Diploma of Merit or a Show Gundog Working Certificate; Field Trial Champion (Ft Ch) means the dog has won a pointer or setter open stake or two first prizes at two different stakes under two different A Panel judges. There must be no less than 16 runners entered; and a Dual Champion \u2013 the highest award available to setters \u2013 is a dog who has achieved the titles of Show Champion and Field Trial Champion.An English Setter called \"Countess\" was the first gun dog to ever attain a Dual Champion title. She was sired by Dash 2nd and her dam was Moll 3rd. Her breeder was Laverack, who sold her to Sam Lang; he in turn passed her on to Llewellin in whose name she was entered in field trials.In the U.K., the breed has been successful at Crufts and secured the award of Best in Show in 1964, 1977 and 1988. At the Westminster show in America an English Setter won the Best in Show title in 1938. He was only 11 months old and at his very first show. This was before entry to the show was restricted to Champions in 1992. As of 2013, he is the only setter to achieve Best in Show at Westminster since the award of Best in Show started to be made in 1907.\n\n\n== Registrations ==\n\nWhen the American Kennel Club was established in 1878, English Setters, together with eight other sporting breeds, were accepted as the first pure-bred registrations by the Club. The very first dog registered with the AKC and the holder of registration number one was an English Setter named \"Adonis\". He was born in 1875 and is recorded as sired by \"Leicester\" out of a bitch named \"Dart\". His colours were given as black, white and tan. He was owned by his breeder George E. Delano of New Bedford, MA.English Setters were especially popular in the UK during the 1960s, 70s and 80s and registrations of puppies reached 1344 during 1974. In 2012, the Kennel Club listed the English Setter amongst the Vulnerable Native Breeds as only 234 puppies were registered. A decade earlier, in 2002, there were 568 English Setter puppies registered. However, during 2012 the number of English Setter puppies registered increased to 314, so the breed was moved to the Kennel Club's \"At Watch\" list, which is for breeds with registrations from 300\u2013450. In 2015 registrations fell to 289 resulting in a return to the Vulnerable Native Breeds list for 2016. The breed is still fairly well represented in Italy, where it is popular as a working gun-dog. Even in Italy, however the breed is in sharp decline, going from 20,999 registrations in 2002, to 14510 registrations in 2011. In contrast, the American Kennel Club stated that 2011 was the \"year of the setters, with all four making big jumps over the past year\". English Setters had previously ranked at 101 in 2010 but moved up to 87 in 2011, a position the breed maintained in 2012.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBarnes, Margaret (1982), English Setters Ancient and Modern: Their History in the Field and on the Bench and Their General Care, Muffin Books, ISBN 978-0-9507887-0-8\n\n\n== External links ==\nEnglish Setter at Curlie"}, {"id": 182, "name": "English Shepherd", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog182", "description": "The English Shepherd is an extremely versatile breed of working dog of the collie lineage, developed in the United States from farm dogs brought by English and Scottish settlers in the 17th through 19th centuries before pedigrees became fashionable around the end of the 19th century. Subsistence farmers appreciated the breed for their versatility and not for their flash or strict conformation to a standard of appearance.\nThe English Shepherd is a highly intelligent, all-around farm dog, being used as a herding dog, livestock guardian, farm watch dog, hunting dog, vermin eradicator and a child's companion. English Shepherds were not bred to be specialized to work one type of livestock as some recent herding dogs have been. English Shepherds were bred to do many tasks on the small diversified farms of the 17th through early 20th centuries that had various types of livestock including cattle, sheep, pigs, goats, and fowl. It may have been the most common breed in America during the 19th and early 20th century.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nEnglish Shepherds are similar in appearance to Border Collies and Australian Shepherds. English Shepherds usually have tails and a less rounded head than many Aussies. English Shepherds are never merle as Aussies frequently are. They are generally not square in body like an Aussie. English Shepherds tend to be larger than Border Collies but are most readily distinguished from Border Collies by their very different upright, loose-eyed herding style.\n\nThe English Shepherd is a medium-sized dog, usually somewhat longer than it is tall. It generally weighs between 20 and 30 kilograms (44 and 66 lb) and is balanced in proportions.  As a working dog on small farms, English Shepherds have been selected to fulfill a variety of needs. This has resulted in a wide range of regional variations.\nThe coat is medium length and can be straight, wavy, or curly. There is frequently feathering on the legs and tail, as well as on the ear. As a working dog, the coat should be easy to keep, requiring very little grooming. Dirt tends to just fall away. English shepherds tend to shed quite a lot and fur may be found on and under furniture, clothes, and carpeting. The primary coat colors are: sable and white (clear and shaded), tricolor, black and white, and black and tan. Other variations such as solid dogs of any color, piebalds, and red nosed tricolors and sables also exist but are not common.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe English Shepherd temperament is the defining characteristic of the breed, with high intelligence and often a unique type of kindness for those in his home, both animals and people. The English Shepherd is often an independent worker. English Shepherds are adaptable and learn routines quickly. Some can be watchful of strangers and are more one-person dogs. However, once he accepts people or children or stock as his own, there are few better caretakers than an English Shepherd.\nThe English Shepherd frequently exhibits an independent, bossy or \"enforcer of the rules\" streak in his temperament. If the dog's desire to enforce order is not channeled and directed to a suitable end by a strong, confident leader, he may exhibit many undesirable behaviors. Nevertheless, English shepherds can thrive as companion dogs in environments that provide sufficient mental and physical stimulation.\nEnglish Shepherds require a lot of exercise (at least 40 minutes of walking per day) and may become destructive if not provided enough. They have a natural instinct to chase and enjoy playing a game of fetch. They tend to become calm and relaxed at the end of the day, likely to curl up at their owner's feet.\nThis breed was selected on diverse small family farms in the past and has been selected to work in a partnership arrangement with his master.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n=== MDR1 gene mutation ===\nRecent research at Washington State University indicates that, in addition to many other herding breeds, approximately 15% of the English Shepherd population is subject to the MDR1 gene mutation. Dogs that are tested positive have increased sensitivity and adverse reactions to a number of common canine drugs. A simple cheek swab is all that is needed to test if the dog has this potentially life-threatening condition.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginating in northern England and Scotland, these dogs came with the first settlers to reach the American colonies. American farmers appreciated this versatile breed and used dogs to protect their farms and livestock. The English Shepherd and various other collies were also referred to as Scotch Collie's during the 18th and 19th centuries but the term \"Scotch Collie\" fell out of favor during the 20th century. Quoting from Leon F. Whitney early in the 20th century (\"How to Breed Dogs\", 1937, no ISBN) \"It is known variously as the farm shepherd, the barnyard collie, the old fashioned shepherd, the cow dog, the English Shepherd, and other colloquial names. And while I doubt there is a more alert, trustworthy, or American dog, still no breed specialty clubs have organized to push it. It is the ordinary shepherd that one sees on farm after farm throughout the country.\" (Despite the publication date of 1937 given here English Shepherds were registered as a breed before that time through UKC (1927) and probably the defunct Southeastern Kennel Club before then.)\nUKC apparently had another registration going on for a type of \"farm shepherd\" that was separate from the English Shepherd. Many times the names were confused but at other times they were distinguished as different breeds. All of these names as well as Farm Collie were applied to the farm shepherds of the era. As there was no breed club or registry until later, there is some dispute over exactly which name applies to which dogs. Australian Shepherd is likely a derivative of these farm dogs and appeared primarily in the Western United States. The English Shepherd on the other hand was more common in the Midwest and East. These dogs are primarily descendants of the working farm dogs of England.\nAs the small diversified farms in the mid-western and eastern United States dwindled in numbers, many of them replaced by larger and less diversified operations, the English Shepherd became a rare breed.\n\n\n== Working life ==\n\nEnglish Shepherds are very quick to learn farm routines and will work independently with little training, but will benefit from some training and guidance. More than just a specialty herding breed, the English Shepherd is also a guardian of property and livestock, and a hunter of game and vermin on their territory. English Shepherds are also known for their ability to track and 'tree' raccoons and squirrels.\nThe modern English Shepherd is best suited for farm work, but they are used for hunting, search and rescue (SAR), therapy, and as competitors in dog agility, obedience, Rally obedience, tracking, and flyball.\nEnglish Shepherds are often larger than Border Collie, but the quickest way to tell the two apart is to put them on stock. Border Collies tend to herd with a distinctive strong eye contact and a crouching stance, while English Shepherds have an upright, loose-eyed herding style. English Shepherds can work all types of stock\u2014from the meanest bull to baby chickens. Compared to others, they are prized above specialty herding breeds for being as gentle as possible or as tough as necessary with the stock.\nThis ability to rate their stock stems from the great empathy they have for their family and livestock.  With the right upbringing, this empathy makes the English Shepherd a wonderful family dog.  However, the same bossy nature which this breed excels at in keeping order on the farm can cause havoc in the local dog park where the English Shepherd often appoints himself as the leader.\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\nEnglish Shepherds can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. English Shepherds exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials. English Shepherds also possess a strong hunting instinct from their past use as an all purpose farm dog. They are known to tree prey and can be trained to flush birds by taking advantage of the innate herding instinct.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nESC Breed & Breeder Info Website\nEnglish Shepherd Club\nEnglish Shepherd Club Registry\nThe United Kennel Club, Inc\nUnited English Shepherd Association\nESC breed standard\nNational English Shepherd Rescue\nRare Breeds Network"}, {"id": 183, "name": "English Springer Spaniel", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog183", "description": "The English Springer Spaniel is a breed of gun dog in the Spaniel family traditionally used for flushing and retrieving game. It is an affectionate, excitable breed with a typical lifespan of twelve to fourteen  years. They are very similar to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and are descended from the Norfolk or Shropshire Spaniels of the mid-19th century; the breed has diverged into separate show and working lines. The breed suffers from average health complaints. The show-bred version of the breed has been linked to \"rage syndrome\", although the disorder is very rare. It is closely related to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and very closely to the English Cocker Spaniel; less than a century ago, springers and cockers would come from the same litter. The smaller \"cockers\" hunted woodcock while the larger littermates were used to flush, or \"spring\", game. In 1902, The Kennel Club recognized the English Springer Spaniel as a distinct breed. They are used as sniffer dogs on a widespread basis. The term Springer comes from the historic hunting role, where the dog would flush (spring) birds into the air.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe English Springer Spaniel is a medium-sized compact dog. Its coat is moderately long with feathering on the legs and tail. It is a well proportioned, balanced dog with a gentle expression and a friendly wagging tail. This breed represents perhaps the greatest divergence between working and show lines of any breed of dog. A field-bred dog and a show-bred dog appear to be different breeds, but are registered together. In fact, the gene pools are almost completely segregated and have been for at least 70 years. A field-bred dog would not be competitive in a modern dog show, while a show dog would not have the speed or stamina to succeed in a field trial.The English Springer Spaniel field-bred dogs tend to have shorter, coarser coats than show-bred dogs. The ears are less pendulous. Field-bred dogs are wiry and have more of a feral look than those bred for showing. The tail of the field-bred dog may be docked a few inches in comparison to the show dog.  Field-bred dogs are selected for sense of smell, hunting ability, and response to training rather than appearance.Show dogs have longer fur and more pendant ears, dewlaps and dangling flews. The tail is docked to a short stub in those countries that permit docking. They are generally more thickly boned and heavier than field-bred springers.The English Springer Spaniel is similar to the English Cocker Spaniel and at first glance the only major difference is the latter's smaller size. However English Springers also tend to have shorter, and higher-set ears than English Cockers. In addition Springers also tend to have a longer muzzle; their eyes are not as prominent, and the coat is less abundant. The major differences between the Welsh Springer and the English Springer are that the Welsh have more limited colours and tend to be slightly smaller.\n\n\n=== Coat and colours ===\nField-bred dogs tend to have shorter, coarser coats than the longer furred show-bred dogs. They normally only shed in summer and spring months but shed occasionally in the autumn. The coat comes in black or liver (dark brown) with white markings or predominantly white with black or liver markings; Tricolour: black and white or liver and white with tan markings, usually found on eyebrows, cheeks, inside of ears and under the tail. Any white portion of the coat may be flecked with ticking.\n\n\n=== Sizes ===\nMales in the show dog line are typically approximately 18 to 20 inches (46 to 51 cm) at the withers and weigh 50 to 55 lb (23 to 25 kg). According to the UK Breed Standard, the English Springer Spaniel should be 20 inches (51 cm) at the withers. The females should be 17 to 19 inches (43 to 48 cm) and usually 35 to 45 lb (16 to 20 kg). Working types can be lighter in weight and finer in bone.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe typical Spaniel is friendly, eager to please, quick to learn and willing to obey. In the right circumstances, it can be an affectionate and easy-going family dog. Its alertness and attentiveness make it a good hunting companion. A typical Springer Spaniel will often choose one person in the family to be most loyal to and stick with that person as much as possible. The English Springer Spaniel ranks 13th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, considered an excellent working dog. It has exceptional stamina and needs moderate amounts of activity, to focus its mind and to provide exercise, although this is different for each dog.  Its long-legged build makes it among the fastest of the spaniels.\nIt is a sociable breed that enjoys the company of children and handles the company of other pets well. The hunting breed may not get along well with cats, however. If left alone for too long, they can become destructive and mischievous through boredom. They love the water, and tend to get wet whenever they have the chance.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe English Springer Spaniel has a typical lifespan of 10.5 to 15 years. As in most breeds, there are some health problems that are more likely to occur. Hip dysplasia and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) (a degeneration of the retina causing vision loss leading to blindness) are two such diseases for which veterinarians are working on genetic markers to determine carriers. Another problem can be elbow dysplasia. Retinal dysplasia (RD), which can cause blindness and Phosphofructokinase deficiency (PFK), which is genetic deficiency which impairs the ability of cells using carbohydrates for energy are two other hereditary conditions for which both lines of the English springer spaniel should be screened prior to breeding. Health issues are usually similar in both types of English Springer however phosphofructokinase deficiency in particular can appear more in field lines, however carriers in show lines have been identified.As with most spaniels and floppy eared dogs, they are prone to ear infections. There are several types of common infections, and treatment typically includes oral antibiotics and cleaning the ear canal daily with a solvent that will also leave the ear in an acidic state to slow the growth of yeast and bacteria. \nOther health problems include autoimmune diseases, which include allergies and other sensitivities to the environment. They can also be susceptible to various eye problems including inward or outward curling eyelashes or even an additional row of eyelashes, all of which can require corrective surgery.English Springer Spaniels tend to gain weight easily, and owners need to be careful about their food consumption. The English Springer Spaniel weight ranges from 44 to 45 pounds. A healthy Springer Spaniel should eat about 1,353 calories per day. \n\n\n== History ==\nEnglish physician Dr. John Caius described the spaniel in his book the Treatise of Englishe Dogs published in 1576. His book was the first work to describe the various British breeds by function. By 1801, Sydenham Edwards explained in the Cynographia Britannica that the land spaniel should be split into two kinds, the Springing, Hawking Spaniel, or Starter; and the Cocking or Cocker Spaniel.At this point in time, both cocker spaniels and springer spaniels were born in the same litters. The purpose of the breed was to serve as a hunting dog. The smaller cockers were used to hunt woodcock, while their larger littermates, the springer spaniels, would \"spring\"\u2014or flush\u2014the gamebird into the air where a trained falcon or hawk would bring it to the handler.Many spaniel breeds were developed during the 19th century, and often named after the counties in which they were developed, or after their owners, who were usually nobility. Two strains of larger land spaniel were predominant and were said to have been of \"true springer type.\" These were the Norfolk and the Shropshire spaniels, and by the 1850s, these were shown under the breed name of Norfolk spaniel.In January 1899, the Spaniel Club of England and the Sporting Spaniel Society held their trials together for the first time. Three years later, in 1902, a combination of the physical standard from the Spaniel Club of England and the ability standard from the Sporting Spaniel Society led to the English Springer Spaniel breed being officially recognised by the English Kennel Club. The American Kennel Club followed in 1910. In 1914, the first English Field Champion was crowned, FTC Rivington Sam, whose dam was a registered cocker spaniel, Rivington Riband. Sam is considered one of the foundation sires for modern field lines.\n\n\n=== Skills ===\nAn English Springer Spaniel is foremost an upland flushing dog. There are a number of skills that breeders train the dog to perform for their occupation.\nRetrieve to Hand Most hunters and all hunt test or field trial judges require that a dog deliver a bird to hand, meaning that a dog will hold the bird until told to give it to the hunter directly.\nSoft Mouth Springers are taught to deliver game with a soft mouth, meaning he does not puncture it with his teeth. The game should always be fit for the table. If a springer damages the bird, it may be hard mouthed. This is a serious fault, but it can be difficult to determine whether it may have been genetic or caused by poor training methods. Breeders generally avoid using any springer that is hard mouthed.\nQuarter A flushing spaniel's primary role is often as an upland flushing dog. Dogs must work in a zig-zag pattern in front of the hunter seeking upland game birds. The dog is taught to stay within gun range to avoid flushing a bird outside shooting distance. This pattern is one of the primary criteria used to judge a dog in a field trial.\nScenting Having the ability to scent game is of vital importance to the hunter. A springer should have a good nose in both wet and dry conditions. A dog with a good nose will learn to use the wind as it quests for game, ever adjusting its pattern according to the nuances of the wind.\nFlushing The springer should have a positive flush. It should not hesitate or point when encountering game. Some field trial dogs will often get airborne during a flush. This is exciting to watch, but is not necessary to win. Most hunters prefer that their dog not flush in that style, as it can present a risk to the dog.\nHup This is the traditional command to sit and stay. When hupped the dog can be given direction called to the handler. The ability to hup a dog actively working a running bird allow the handler and any gunners to keep up without having to run.\nFollow Hand Signals Upland hunting involves pursuing wild game in its native habitat. Gun dogs must investigate likely covers for upland game birds. The dog must be responsive to hand signals in order for the hunter to be able to direct the dog into areas of particular interest.\nSteady When hunting upland birds, a flushing dog should be steady to wing and shot, meaning that he sits when a bird rises or a gun is fired. He does this in order to mark the fall and to avoid flushing other birds when pursuing a missed bird.\nBlind Retrieve An adequately trained and experienced working springer can be expected to use all of the aforementioned attributes to be conducted by hand, whistle and command to a position whereby an unmarked lost game bird can be picked and retrieved to hand.\n\n\n== Detection dog ==\n\nThe Springer Spaniel is used as a sniffer dog. Notable search dogs have included Buster, a Dickin Medal recipient, Royal Army Veterinary Corps arms and explosives search dog serving with the Duke of Wellington's Regiment in Iraq, for finding an extremist group's hidden arsenal of weapons and explosives. Another example is Jake, aka Hubble Keck People's Dispensary for Sick Animals Gold Medal and Blue Cross Animal Hospital Medal recipient, a London Metropolitan Police explosives search dog. He was deployed at Tavistock Square, Russell Square and King's Cross following the 7 July 2005 London Bombings.The Springer is not limited to detecting explosives. Murphy, a male Springer has been trained by HM Prison Service in HMP Norwich to search for mobile phones. He can tell the difference between the guards' phones and illegal phones held by inmates. Other varied uses for the Springer can include sniffing out bumblebee nests, illegal immigrants, and blood. Springers are used for drug detection in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland, Isle of Man, Ireland, Canada CBSA and Qatar.The Springer Spaniel is also used as a search and rescue dog by mountain rescue teams, where their willingness to work and cover rough terrain makes them an excellent choice. \n\nEnglish Springer Spaniel\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notable English Springer Spaniels ==\nAwarded the Dickin Medal for conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving in military conflict:\n\nTheo\nBusterAwarded the PDSA Gold Medal for animal bravery:\n\nGhillie\n\n\n== See also ==\nHunting dog\nSporting Group\nCocker Spaniel\nMountain Rescue\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEnglish Springer Spaniel at Curlie"}, {"id": 184, "name": "English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan)", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "", "picture": "dog184", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 185, "name": "English Water Spaniel", "country": "United Kingdom", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog185", "description": "The English Water Spaniel is a breed of dog that has been extinct since the first part of the 20th century, with the last specimen seen in the 1930s. It was best known for its use in hunting waterfowl and for being able to dive as well as a duck. It is described as  similar to a Collie or to a cross between a Poodle and a Springer Spaniel with curly fur and typically in a white and liver/tan pattern.\nPre-dating the Irish Water Spaniel and thought to have been referred to by Shakespeare in Macbeth, it is believed to have genetically influenced several modern breeds of dog, including the American Water Spaniel, Curly Coated Retriever and the modern variety of Field Spaniel. It is unknown if the breed was involved in the creation of the Irish Water Spaniel.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1570, Dr John Caius described the Water Spaniel. It has been suggested that Shakespeare  also knew the breed \"for he mentions the `water rug' in Macbeth. \" Furthermore, Shakespeare specifically mentions the breed in Act III Scene 1 of The Two Gentlemen of Verona when Launce says of his love, \"She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel.\"\n\nThe breed is mentioned specifically by name as early as 1802, in Sportsman's Cabinet, where it is described as having \"hair long and naturally curled, not loose and shaggy\"; the description accompanied an engraving of a liver and white curly coated spaniel. This shows that they pre-date the Irish Water Spaniel which was not developed as a breed until the 1830s. Unfortunately as the person credited with developing the Irish Water Spaniel, Justin McCarthy, left no written records, it is unknown if the English Water Spaniel was involved in its development. During the first half of the 18th century, the English Water Spaniel was used for duck hunting in East Anglia.The Kennel Club initially had a class for \"Water spaniels other than Irish\" as no standard was specifically set up for the English Water Spaniel and the judging of this class was described as \"chaos\" by Hugh Dalziel in British Dogs: Their Varieties, History, Characteristics, Breeding, Management, And Exhibition. Writing in 1897, Dalziel said of the breed, \"I do not believe the breed is lost, but that scattered throughout the country there are many specimens of the old English water spaniel, which it only requires that amount of encouragement to breeding which it is in the power of show committees to give to perpetuate the variety and improve its form.\" Dalziel bemoaned the fact that while the Irish Water Spaniel continued, the English Water Spaniel was allowed to quietly be absorbed into other Spaniel breeds.\n\nThe stud book of the Kennel Club also had a class for \"Water spaniels other than Irish\", however only fourteen dogs were registered in the twelve years up to 1903. This led some writers and judges of that time to believe that the English Water Spaniel was merely a cross of the Irish Water Spaniel as entrants in dogs shows in that same class do not match the description of the dog from earlier periods. Dogs awarded prizes as Water Spaniels during this period have been described as having \"coats as flat as a Clumber, but with a bit of longish hair about the top of the skull.\"Writing in 1967, author John F. Gordon stated, \"After two centuries of breeding it is now extinct. None have been seen for over thirty years.\" Descendant breeds of the English Water Spaniel are thought to include the American Water Spaniel, which was also developed using additional stock from the Irish Water Spaniel and the Flat Coated Retriever breeds. The Curly Coated Retriever is considered to have descended from the Poodle, the retrieving setter, the St. John's water dog and the English Water Spaniel. Records for the origin of the modern Field Spaniel are more precise and show that one of the four progenitor dogs used in creating the breed was an English Water Spaniel-Cocker Spaniel cross which was registered at the time as a Sussex Spaniel due to his liver colour.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nVery unlike the Irish Water Spaniel in appearance, the English Water Spaniel  more closely resembled a curly-haired version of the Springer Spaniel, with some traits of the Collie, poodle, and setter. The white and liver (tan) dog stood about 20 inches (51 cm) tall and looked like a typical, lean, long-legged spaniel with long ears and tail, a white underbelly, and  a brown back, except that it had the coat of a water dog.The English Water Spaniel was described as having a long and narrow head, with small eyes and ears that were long and covered in thick curls of fur. The body was moderately stout and barrel shaped, but not as much as that of the Field Spaniel. Its legs were long and straight with large feet. The dog varied in size with the larger varieties known as \"Water Dogs\" and the smaller as \"Water Spaniels\".Due to the English Water Spaniel's colours of liver (tan) and white, it has been suggested that the breed may have been the source of the colours now found in the modern English Springer Spaniel and Welsh Springer Spaniel breeds.\n\n\n== Hunting ==\nPaintings by Henry Bernard Chalon and Ramsay Richard Reinagle both show English Water Spaniels working with their masters  hunting ducks. An engraving by Henry Thomas Alken Snr. shows a slightly different looking English Water Spaniel, but also reinforces its area of work by again showing it while duck hunting. In The Sportsman's Repository (1820), the author advises that if an individual wishes to hunt ducks or any other type of waterfowl, then the hunter had best use an English Water Spaniel.The breed is described as swimming and diving as well as the ducks themselves; and they are intelligent enough to avoid being lured away from the nesting places. The author described the best variety of the breed to be those with long ears whose coat was white under the belly and around the neck but brown on the back.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 186, "name": "English White Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog186", "description": "The English White Terrier (also known as the White English Terrier or Old English Terrier) is an extinct breed of dog. The English White Terrier is the failed show ring name of a pricked-ear version of the white fox-working terriers that have existed in Great Britain since the late 18th century.\nThe name \"English White Terrier\" was invented and embraced in the early 1860s by a handful of breeders anxious to create a new breed from a prick-eared version of the small white working terriers that were later developed into the Fox Terrier, the Jack Russell Terrier, the Sealyham Terrier and later, in the United States, the Boston Terrier and the Rat Terrier. In the end, however, the Kennel Club hierarchy decided the \"English White Terrier\" was a distinction without a difference, while the dog's genetic problems made it unpopular with the public. Within 30 years of appearing on the Kennel Club scene, the English White Terrier had slipped into extinction. It was, however, crossbred with the Old English Bulldog giving rise to the Boston Terrier and Bull Terrier.\n\n\n== Breed history ==\nSmall bred working terriers have existed in Great Britain since at least the late 18th century. These dogs have always been quite variable in terms of size and shape, with dogs ranging in size from 10 to 15 inches, and with both drop ears and prick ears, smooth, broken, and rough coats.(Burns, 2005)\nWith the rise of dog shows in the 1860s, breed fancy enthusiasts raced to name and \"improve\" every type of dog they could find, and terriers were at the very top of their list. From the long-extent white-bodied working terriers came the Fox terrier, the Jack Russell terrier, the Parson Russell terrier, and the Sealyham terrier.\nIn the rush to create and claim new breeds, competing groups of dog breeders sometimes came up with different names for the same dog, and it was very common for entirely fictional breed histories to be cobbled up as part of a campaign to declare a new breed and create a bit of personal distinction for a dog's originator (to say nothing of sales).\nIn the 1860s and 1870s, a small group of dog show enthusiasts tried to claim that prick-eared versions of white working terriers were an entirely different breed from those same dogs with dropped ears. The problems with this claim were legion, however. For one thing, prick and drop-eared dogs were often found in the same litter, while entirely white dogs had a propensity for deafness and were therefore nearly useless in the field. (Briggs, 1894)\nIn 1894, Rawdon Briggs Lee wondered, in his book Modern Dogs, about the relatively recent origin of the \"English White Terrier\" and noted that, \"It has been surmised that the original English White Terrier had been a fox terrier crossed with a white Italian greyhound\" (i.e. a toy breed).\nLee noted that at the London dogs shows where the breed first appeared in 1863\u20131864, the dogs were presented in two classes: \"one being for dogs and bitches under six or seven pounds weight, as the case may be; the other for dogs and bitches over that standard.\"\nIn 1894, about the time that English White Terriers finally disappeared from the Kennel Club scene (it was always a pet and show dog, and never a working dog), Lee noted that \"The most recent London-bred specimens I have seen have been comparative toys, under 10lb. in weight, and with a rounded skull, or so-called 'apple head,\" which so persists in making its appearance in lilliputian specimens of the dog \u2013 an effect of inbreeding.\"\nThough Lee included a club description of the dog claiming the dog could be found as heavy as 20 lbs in weight, Lee (a noted Kennel Club judge and Kennel Editor of The Field sport hunting magazine) took the trouble to note that \"As a matter of fact, I do not ever remember seeing a really so-called pure English White Terrier up to 20 lbs, the maximum allowed by the club.\"\nLee describes the English White Terrier as \"the most fragile and delicate of all our terriers,\" noting that \"he is not a sportsman's companion,\" but that he \"makes a nice house dog\" but \"requires a considerable amount of cuddling and care.\"\nLee notes that at some of the early dog shows \"some of the specimens were shaped more like an Italian greyhound than as a terrier\" and that the dog \"is particularly subject to total or partial deafness.\"\nThough the dog still existed as a breed in 1894, Briggs could see the writing on the wall and did not bemoan the possible extinction of this show-ring failure:  \"While regretting extremely the decay of the White English Terrier, I am afraid they must bow to the inevitable, and give place to dogs better suited to the wants and conveniences of the present day than they unfortunately are.\"\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nFrom Modern Dogs by Rawdon Briggs Lee (1894):\n\nThe description of the white English terrier is drawn up by the club as follows; the table of points is not issued by the club, but the figures, in my opinion, indicate the numerical value of eachpoint, and not carried higher than the back. \n\nCOAT: Close, hard, short, and glossy.\nCOLOUR: Pure white, coloured marking to disqualify.\nCONDITION: Flesh and muscles to be hard and firm.\nWEIGHT: From 12 lb. to 20 lb.\n\n\n=== Silvio ===\nAlfred Benjamin, owned a male Old English terrier, named 'Silvio' (born 1876).

The name Sennenhund refers to people called Senn, herders in the Swiss Alps. Entlebuch is a region in the canton of Lucerne in Switzerland. The breed is also known in English as the Entelbuch Mountain Dog, Entelbucher Cattle Dog,  and similar combinations.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAll of the Sennenhund breeds are believed to be descended from large molossers brought to Switzerland by the Romans in the first century B.C. However, the Entlebucher was only described as a separate breed in 1889, although for many years little distinction was made between the Appenzeller Sennenhund and the Entlebucher Sennenhund. In 1913, four bobtail Entlebucher Sennenhund were shown to Albert Heim, an advocate for the increasingly rare Sennenhund breeds. The breed was entered into the Swiss Kennel Club stud book, but World War I intervened, and at first after the war no examples of the breed could be found. The first breed club was not formed until 1926, sixteen dogs of the type were found in 1927, and the breed slowly was restored. Although originally kept for guarding and herding, today the breed is usually kept as a lively companion.\n\n\n=== Four breeds of Sennenhund ===\nThe four breeds of Sennenhund, with the original breed name followed by the most popular English version of the breed name.\n\nGrosser Schweizer Sennenhund, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog\nBerner Sennenhund, Bernese Mountain Dog\nAppenzeller Sennenhund, Appenzeller\nEntlebucher Sennenhund, Entlebucher Mountain DogIt shares many characteristics of other Mountain dogs from around the world.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe female Entlebucher Sennenhund is a square; the male is a longer, less square, sturdy, medium-sized dog. It has small, triangular ears and rather small brown eyes. The head is well proportioned to the body, with a strong flat skull. The long jaw is well formed and powerful. The feet are compact, supporting its muscular body. The smooth coat is close and smooth with symmetrical markings of black, tan, and white. This tricolor coat has white on its toes, tail-tip, and the chest and blaze where the fur is soft and fluffy; the tan always lies between the black and the white. It has muscular, broad hips. The hocks are naturally well angled. The tail is sometimes docked, a practice which is now prohibited by law in many countries, or it may have a natural bobtail. Height at the withers is 19-20 ins (48\u201350 cm) and weight is  45-65 lbs (20\u201330 kg).\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nAs with all large, active working dogs, this breed should be well socialized early in life with other dogs and people, and  be provided with regular activity and training. Temperament of individual dogs may vary. The Standard says that the breed is \"good-natured and devoted towards people familiar to him, slightly suspicious of strangers.\"\n\n\n== Kennel club recognition ==\nThe Entlebucher Sennenhund  is recognised internationally by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, using the standard written in the breed's native Switzerland. Other national kennel clubs not affiliated with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale also recognise the breed, often writing their own versions of the breed standard. \nThe Entlebucher  is  recognised by The Kennel Club (UK) and the Canadian Kennel Club and placed in the Working Group. The United States Kennel Club (US) places the breed in the Guardian Dog Group. It is not yet recognised by the New Zealand Kennel Club or the Australian National Kennel Council. The breed is recognised by numerous small clubs and internet-based registries, where it is promoted as a rare breed for puppy buyers seeking a unique pet.\nThe breed was accepted into the American Kennel Club Stud Book on December 1, 2010 and became eligible to compete in the herding dog group on  January 1, 2011.\n\n\n== Health issues ==\nInbreeding due to the small foundation stock numbers has led to Entlebuchers suffering from congenital defects, the most common of which is hip dysplasia. Hemolytic anemia also is known to occur. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) is also present in the breed. The National Entlebucher Mountain Dog Association (NEMDA), in collaboration with other organizations, is working to eliminate these issues from the breed through responsible breeding, genetic testing, and fact dissemination.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPreservation breeding\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEntlebucher Mountain Dog at Curlie\nGenetics of tricolour coats"}, {"id": 188, "name": "Estonian Hound", "country": "Estonia", "type": "", "picture": "dog188", "description": "The Estonian Hound (Estonian: eesti hagijas) is a scent hound-like breed which is the only dog breed developed in Estonia. It was bred in 1947 when the Soviet Union's national economy ministry decided that every country in the Union must have its own dog breed.\nThe Estonian Kennel Union is working on the recognition of the breed by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Estonian Hound is relatively young breed that is already highly valued in Estonia, its country of origin. This breed resulted from the crossbreeding of several foreign dog breeds with local hunting dogs. The Estonian Hound\u2019s development was announced by an ultimatum issued by the Soviet Union\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture and Economy in 1947, which ordered every Soviet Republic to establish a local breed of hunting dogs to replace the large breeds of hunting dogs bred at that moment. These large dogs were blamed for the rapid decline of Estonia\u2019s wildlife population; it was established that only dogs with a maximum height of 17 inches were allowed to hunt. The result was a very agile and hard driven breed that has enjoyed tremendous popularity since then: the modern Estonian Hound. After Estonia regained its independence, the Estonian Hound was proclaimed the country\u2019s national dog.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Estonian Hound is a dog of medium size and a strong muscular body, bone structure and muscles that are well developed. It has no folds in its skin and drop ears. The coat is short and rough and should be shiny. The undercoat is weakly developed. This breed's eyes are dark brown colored. The Estonian Hound usually has black patches and a dark pigmented skin. The size of the patches is unlimited. Blackish-brown color, red patches and a saddle like patches on the back are also allowed, but the tip of the tail has to be white.\nThe Estonian Hound's height is 17\u201321 inches (43\u201353 cm) and it weighs 33\u201344 pounds (15\u201320 kg).\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Estonian Hound is happy and pleasant dog with a balanced, calm and active temperament and a high intelligence. It is friendly and should never be aggressive, so it needs to be socialized and exposed to new situations and environments in order to prevent it from being a bit timid. It is good with other dogs and usually also with cats if used to them as a puppy. They love human attention and can get upset when left alone. Proper human to canine communication is really important to its training. They are affectionate and easy to teach; this is important since they have to learn that they cannot hunt hoofed animals as it is forbidden in Estonia where only hare and foxes are allowed to be hunted. The Estonian Hound has a pleasant voice that doesn\u2019t annoy  when it hunts.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nEstonian Hound Web-Clab\n\nhttp://www.thefifthpaw.com"}, {"id": 189, "name": "Estrela Mountain Dog", "country": "Portugal", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog189", "description": "The Estrela Mountain Dog is a large breed of dog which has been used for centuries in the Estrela Mountains of Portugal to guard herds and homesteads.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nThe Estrela Mountain dog comes in two coat types. Both types should have coat resembling the texture of goat hair.\nLong coat: The thick, slightly coarse outer coat lies close over the body and may be flat or slightly waved, but never curly. Undercoat is very dense and normally lighter in color than the outer coat. The hair on the front sides of the legs and the head is short and smooth. Hair on the ears diminishes in length from the base of the ears to the tips. The hair on the neck, the buttocks, the tail, and the back side of the legs is longer resulting in a ruff at the neck, breeches on the buttocks and backs of the legs, and feathering on the tail.  The males can have a \"lion's mane\".\nShort coat: The outer coat is short, thick, and slightly coarse, with a shorter dense undercoat. Any feathering should be in proportion.\n\n\n=== Color ===\nFawn, wolf gray and yellow, with or without brindling, white markings or shadings of black throughout the coat. All colors have a dark facial mask, preferably black. Blue coloration is very undesirable.\n\n\n=== Size ===\nDesirable height for mature males is 25\u00bd - 28\u00bd inches and for mature females is 24\u00bd - 27 inches. Mature males in good working condition weigh between 88 and 110 pounds. Mature females in good working condition weigh between 66 and 88 pounds.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nA large, athletic dog, the Estrela Mountain Dog is a formidable opponent for any predator. It is calm but fearless and will not hesitate to react to danger, making it an exceptional watchdog as well as an excellent guard dog. It is intelligent, loyal, and faithful, affectionate to those it knows but wary of those it does not. It is instinctively protective of any children in its family. It needs early and continued socialization to be trustworthy around small pets and other dogs.\nIt's important to begin training and socializing the Serra da Estrela dog from puppyhood to nurture its acceptance of different situations. This is a strong independent-minded breed that will need persistent training and consistent leadership. It has a tendency to bark, especially when protecting his or her territory. As with most livestock guardians, the Serra da Estrela dog is not a pet for everyone. Strong ownership is paramount.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe breed has been developed in the mountains of Serra da Estrela, in what is now Portugal. The Estrela Mountain Dog is one of the oldest breeds in Portugal. The earliest of the Estrela ancestors were herd-guarding dogs in the Serra da Estrela, in what is now Portugal. Since there are no written records, it is not known for sure whether the ancestors which contributed to this breed were brought by the Romans when they colonized the Iberian Peninsula, or later by the invading Visigoths. Regardless, there is no disagreement that the Estrela is one of the oldest breeds in Portugal.\n\nThose early guardian dogs were not the distinct breed we know today. Rather, the Estrela developed over a period of hundreds of years. Shepherds would have chosen to breed the dogs that had the characteristics necessary to survive in their mountain environment and to do their job: large size, strength, endurance, agility, a deep chest, ability to tolerate a marginal diet, the set of the legs, a powerful mouth, a tuft of hair around the neck, an easy, jog-like gait, a warm coat, and a watchful, mistrustful, yet loyal temperament. Since the region was isolated, there was little breeding with non-native dogs, leading to the purity of the breed.Life changed little for the people and dogs of the region, even into the 20th century. The isolation of the region meant the breed was relatively unknown outside it until the early 1900s, and even then, they were mostly ignored in early dog shows. The Portuguese admired foreign breeds much more than their own. Shepherds often castrated their dogs to prevent them from leaving their flocks to mate. These factors had a negative effect on the Estrela. So from 1908 to 1919, special shows called concursos were held to promote and preserve the Estrela breed in the region. During this period there was some attempt at a registry (of which there is no surviving record). Special livestock guardian working trials were included in these shows. The trial consisted of an owner/shepherd bringing his dog into a large field with many flocks of sheep. The dog was observed by judges for its reactions coming into the field and as the shepherd was ordered to move the flock, which inevitably produced stragglers. The dog was expected to move from his spot of guarding to bring the stragglers back, and then assume a leadership position at the head of the flock.\nThe first, tentative, recorded breed standard was published in 1922. This standard only reflected the functional features naturally found in the best dogs of the time, although it did mention having dew claws as reflecting a \u201cperfect\u201d dog. The characteristic hooked tail and turned-back (rosed) ears, which later became part of the official standard, were not mentioned in this preliminary standard.\n\nThe first official breed standard was written in 1933. This standard attempted to differentiate the Estrela as a distinct breed. This led to the hooked tail and double dew claws becoming a requirement. All colors were allowed. The standard has undergone small refinements since then. For example, dew claws became optional by 1955, and the allowed colors have been limited a few times to achieve today\u2019s current set.Prior to World War II, the Estrela breeders were still primarily the shepherds and farmers of the region. Since they were mostly illiterate, they did not make any attempt to follow the official breed standard, if they even knew one existed. But by the early 1950s, interest in the breed returned, and the annual concursos were reinstated. Again the intent was to stimulate interest among the Serra residents and to encourage them to adhere to the official standard. During this period, the long-haired variety was most popular at shows, but \u201cshow dogs\u201d represented (and still do) only a small portion of the Estrela population in Portugal. Many of the working dogs were (and are) short-haired.\nEarly in the 1970s, interest was steeply declining. There was some concern about the degeneration and even possible extinction of the breed. But the Portuguese revolution of 1974 helped save the Estrela. It led to changes both in dog shows in Portugal and in Portuguese dog breeds. Prior to the revolution, dog showing had largely been a pastime of the wealthy, with their preference for non-Portuguese breeds as status symbols. Now, working people could and did show the native dogs they preferred. Also, with the revolution came an increase in crime and thus more interest in guard dogs.\nThere is no record of the Estrela outside Portugal prior to 1972. While some undoubtedly did leave the country, they were probably interbred, with no effort to maintain the breed. In 1972 and 1973, pairs were imported to the US. Others were probably imported into the US since then, but it was not until 1998 that the first papered dog was imported into the United States. The United Kingdom was the first country to establish the breed outside Portugal in 1972. Today the Estrela can be found in many countries.\nToday, the Estrela Mountain Dog remains true to its guardian heritage. It is still a working dog, guarding flocks in its native Portugal and elsewhere (the Portuguese Marines had even used them as patrol dogs). It is also an ideal family pet because of its alertness, loyalty, intelligence, and its instinct to nurture young; all features it needed in its earliest days.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSources\n\nUKC Estrela Mountain Dog Breed Standard\nEstrela Mountain Dog Association of America, EMDAA\nStar Mountain Kennel\n\n\n=== Permission ===\nPermission was given by the breed club for the use of that history section from the breed club website.

It is widely known as a wonderful companion that maintains its own personality, has a dignified reserve to strangers, a strong bond to its family and that is relatively easy to train.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Eurasier is a balanced, well-constructed, medium-sized Spitz (Spitzen) type dog with prick ears. It comes in different colors: fawn, red, wolf-grey, solid black, and black and tan. All color combinations are allowed, except for pure white, white patches, and liver color. F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) standards call for the Eurasier to have a thick undercoat and medium-long, loosely lying guard hair all over the body, with a short coat on the muzzle, face, ears, and front legs. The tail and the back of the front legs (feathers) and hind legs (breeches) should be covered with long hair. The coat on the Eurasier's neck should be slightly longer than on the body, but not forming a mane. The breed may have a pink, blue-black or spotted tongue.\nThe male has a height of 52 to 60 cm (20\u201323.5 inches) at the withers and weighs between 23 and 32 kg (50\u201370 lb) and the female has a height of 48 to 56 cm (19\u201322 inches) at the withers and weighs between 18 and 26 kg (40\u201357 lb).\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nEurasiers are calm, even-tempered dogs. They are watchful and alert, yet reserved towards strangers without being timid or aggressive. Eurasiers form a strong link to their families. For the full development of these qualities, the Eurasier needs constant close contact with its family, combined with understanding, yet consistent, training. They are extremely sensitive to harsh words or discipline and respond best to soft reprimand. The Eurasier is a combination of the best qualities of the Chow Chow, the Keeshond, and the Samoyed (dog), resulting in a dignified, intelligent breed.\nEurasiers were bred as companion dogs; as such they do poorly in a kennel environment such as those commonly used for institutionally trained service dogs, nor are they well suited for the social stresses of working as a sled or guard dog.  Training should always be done through family members, not through strangers or handlers. Eurasiers should never be restricted to only a yard, kennel, crate, or chained up. They would pine and become depressed. Within these limitations, Eurasiers can work very well as therapy dogs.  This breed enjoys all kinds of activities, especially if the activities involve their family. Eurasiers are calm and quiet indoors, outdoors they are lively and enjoy action. Eurasiers rarely bark but if they do, they usually have a good reason.\n\nEurasia\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== History ==\nEurasiers originated in Germany in 1960, when the founder, Julius Wipfel, set out together with Charlotte Baldamus and a small group of enthusiasts to create a breed with the best qualities of the Chow Chow and the Wolfspitz. The initial combination of the breeds resulted in what was first called \"Wolf-Chow\" and then, twelve years later, after crossing with a Samoyed, was renamed \"Eurasier\" (Eurasian) and recognized by the FCI in 1973. Nobel Laureate Konrad Lorenz obtained a Eurasier puppy from Charlotte Baldamus, Nanette vom Jaegerhof, whom he called \"Babett\". He thought her character was the best he had ever known in a dog.\nToday, unethical breeders sometimes try to pass off a Keeshond/Chow Chow mix as a Eurasier. While they are genetically similar, these mixes cannot be classified as Eurasiers.\nEurasiers are still a comparatively young breed. The three Eurasier Clubs are in the German Kennel Club VDH / FCI \u2014EKW, KZG, and ZG\u2014therefore strongly direct and supervise breeding in Germany. A group of dedicated Eurasier Clubs has joined together in the International Federation for Eurasier Breeding (IFEZ) in the FCI. Eurasier puppies bred according to these sound IFEZ guidelines receive an IFEZ certificate.\nThe Eurasier breed was recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club (CKC) in 1995 as a member of Group 3 (Working Dogs).\nThe Kennel Club announced in December 2012 that with effect from April 1, 2013, the Eurasier breed will transfer from the imported register to the breed register.\n\n\n== Health ==\nEurasiers are generally healthy dogs, though a small gene pool in the breed's early years has led to some hereditary diseases being seen occasionally.  Known issues include hip dysplasia, luxating patella, and hypothyroidism, as well as eyelid and lash disorders such as distichiae, entropion, and ectropion.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAnnelie Feder et al., Eurasier heute.

The Eurohound is typically crossbred from the Alaskan husky group and any of a number of pointing breeds (\"pointers\").\n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to Egil Ellis, a top sled dog racer, various types of pointers have been popular with Swedish sled dog racers for at least the last 50 years, and Alaskan huskies were imported to Sweden in the 1980s; crossbreeding pointers and huskies began \"to come up with something new, something that the mushers did not have in Alaska\". \"A Eurohound is a cross between an Alaskan husky and German Shorthaired Pointer... This cross first successfully entered the competitive sled dog racing world in Scandinavia.\" The Eurohound is not purebred, and is not a breed of dog, but a mongrel that instead is continually crossbred from purebreds and mixes in order to produce dogs for specific running conditions.\n\n\n== Crossbreeding ==\nRather than inbreeding similar-looking dogs in order to create a new breed with a consistent appearance, Eurohound racers crossbreed for specific working traits and health. Crossbreeding includes breeding between two established breeds, with two tightly bred but unrelated gene pools, and breeding the first generation cross back to one of the purebred breeds. Crossbreeding is also done for the purpose of heterosis (hybrid vigor). The dogs most often used for Eurodog crosses are purebred German Shorthaired Pointers and English Pointers), other pointers, and Alaskan huskies (Gareth Wright lines primarily) from tightly bred sprint dog lines used for racing.\nA first-generation Eurohound cross (fifty percent pointing breed, fifty percent husky) have short coats, suitable for sprint races, which don't involve resting or sleeping on the trail. When the first-generation cross is crossed again with the Alaskan husky, the resulting generation can have thicker coats, suitable for longer-distance teams. Most distance mushers prefer the pointer genetics to only be 1/8 in a dog for maximum performance.  This then reduces the Eurohound influence, and dogs should be termed Alaskan Husky crosses or mixed hounds.\nThe term \"Eurohound\" was coined by Ivana Nolke, to distinguish the European racing dogs being imported into Alaska.  Greyhound \u00d7 pointer crosses are coined \"greysters\" and popular for dryland racing, and  limited-class snow racing.\n\n\n== Appearance and breeds ==\nAs the Eurohound is a carefully bred performance dog type rather than a kennel club registered purebred breed, its appearance will vary. Characteristics of pointers, huskies, and any other breeds used in breeding may show up in the dogs. Breeders may target a specific size or coat length for the type of racing they do. \"Our pointers and most of our crossbreeds have a weight of 18\u201324 kilos\" (Egil Ellis).Fairly common features of fifty percent crosses are half-dropped ears, black with white blazing as shown in the photo, or solid with patches of spots. Some completely spotted dogs appear as well. Once the percentage of pointer drops, the dogs start to look more like Alaskan huskies.\nThe Alaskan husky sprint dog has been tightly bred for performance, since sled dog racing began in Alaska. The German Shorthaired Pointer and English Pointer gene pool is restricted by the fact that they are registered breeds, but they too were bred for performance; the Scandinavian pointers from which the first Eurohounds came had been used historically for sled dog racing and hunting.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nAlthough more accurately and traditionally called \"crossbred\", crossbred dogs are sometimes referred to incorrectly as \"hybrid\", as a fashionable trend. A hybrid animal most often refers to one with parentage of two separate species or subspecies (but sometimes even genera), differentiating it from crossbred animals, which have parentage of the same species. All dogs, including crossbreeds, are even of the same subspecies Canis lupus familiaris, and so crossbred dogs are not a hybridization with another species.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPersonal observation of some of the newer sled dog mixes"}, {"id": 192, "name": "Field Spaniel", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog192", "description": "The Field Spaniel is a medium-sized dog breed of spaniel type. They were originally developed to be all-black show dogs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and were unpopular for work as a hunting dog. However, during the mid-20th century they were redeveloped as a longer-legged dog that was more suitable to be used for field work. They are now considered to be a rare breed, and are registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by The Kennel Club.\nTheir fur is darker than other spaniels and they have no undercoat like most of the other field type spaniels. Their coats come mostly in solid colours with some occasional markings on the chest. They can make good family dogs and are patient with children, but can require some sort of purpose, be it hunting or agility work in order to prevent them from becoming bored and destructive.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Field Spaniel was originally developed for the show ring by competitors who were attempting to develop an all-black Spaniel. Some of the breeding methods of those early developers were criticised; one of the first breeders of the Field Spaniel, Thomas Jacobs, said of the origin; \"Much has been written and said on the purity of the breed; deprecating the means I have adopted to produce them as calculated to alter a presumed type, and frequent missiles have been hurled at me and my dogs from behind the hedge. But where is the pure bred black spaniel we hear so much about? Proof of the existence of the pure bred one (if there ever was one!) has not been forthcoming. Like most sporting dogs, they are the result of different crosses.\"They were unpopular with sportsmen as the dark colours of the breed did not show up in hunting conditions, and the elongated and short shape of the early breed was not very practical for moving easily through cover. The low-slung variety of Field Spaniel were developed by Phineas Bullock from dogs previously owned by Sir Francis Burdett, the secretary of the Birmingham Dog Show. Burdett was said to have owned a variety of black Cocker Spaniels. Bullock crossed the Field Spaniel with the Sussex Spaniel and the English Water Spaniel. In the 1870s he was very successful in the show ring with his variety of Field Spaniel; however, it resulted in a dog that was almost exactly like a Sussex Spaniel with the exception of the head itself.The dog who is considered to be the father of the modern English Cocker Spaniel is Ch. Obo, who was born in 1879 to a Sussex Spaniel father and a Field Spaniel mother. Obo's son Ch. Obo II is considered to be the father of the modern American Cocker Spaniel, who was described as being only ten inches high with quite a long body.By 1909, the average weight of a Field Spaniel was 35\u201345 pounds (16\u201320 kg). Further mixing of the breed occurred with elements of the Basset Hound introduced. Various genetic health issues arose and action was taken in order to correct the problems within the breed. English Springer Spaniels were used to introduce healthier elements into the breed and resulted in the longer legged spaniel that we know today. Most of the modern breed can be traced to four dogs from the 1950s; Colombina of Teffont, Elmbury Morwena of Rhiwlas, Gormac Teal, and Ronayne Regal.The Field Spaniel remains a rare breed, even in the UK. In 2009, a total of 51 dogs were registered with The Kennel Club and has been in steady decline since 2000. Out of all the Spaniel breeds registered with The Kennel Club, the Field Spaniel has the lowest numbered registered year on year, with only the Sussex Spaniel coming a close second with 60 registrations in 2009. This is compared to the English Springer Spaniel with 12,700 and the English Cocker Spaniel with 22,211 registrations in 2009 alone. In order to promote the breed, they have been registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by The Kennel Club.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe standard size for a Field Spaniel is 17\u201318 inches (43\u201346 cm) tall at the withers, and a weight of between 40\u201355 pounds (18\u201325 kg). This places it roughly between the English Cocker Spaniel and the English Springer Spaniel in size. Its coat comes in solid colours of black and liver, or in roan. Tan points, white markings on the throat and the chest can be ticked or the same colour as the rest of the body.They have a moderately long single coat with no undercoat. Feathering of the fur appears on the chest, belly, ears and on the back of the legs. The coat is not as heavy as that of a Cocker Spaniel but requires grooming in order to prevent mats from appearing in the fur. Docking of tails has been banned in a number of countries, including the UK, however, an exemption is made for working animals.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe Field Spaniel is an active and inquisitive breed, and makes a good companion. However, if left alone and unoccupied for long periods of time, they may become bored and destructive. They are suitable for dog agility and hunting. However, they are patient with children and like to stay close to their family. When socialised, they are good with other dogs. They are generally docile and independent, and are not as excitable as Cocker Spaniels. Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs lists the breed as being above average in working intelligence.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThere are a few ocular conditions to which the Field Spaniel has a predisposition. These include cataracts, retinal atrophy and retinal dysplasia. Hip dysplasia has appeared in British lines of Field Spaniels. The Kennel Club and British Veterinary Association highly recommend eye testing and hip scoring be carried out by Field Spaniel breeders. In a health survey conducted by the Kennel Club (UK), the primary cause of death in Field Spaniels was cancer, with the second most frequent cause being old age. The median lifespan for the breed was found to be eleven years and eight months, which is five months higher than the median age for all dog breeds. However, as the authors noted, a response rate of only 24% may have resulted in reduced accuracy.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGrayson, Peggy (1984) The History and management of the Field Spaniel, Scan Books, ISBN 0-906360-10-2\n\n\n== External links ==\nField Spaniel at Curlie"}, {"id": 193, "name": "Fila Brasileiro", "country": "Brazil", "type": "", "picture": "dog193", "description": "The Fila Brasileiro (Portuguese pronunciation: [\u02c8fil\u0250 \u02ccbrazi\u02c8lej\u027eu]) also known as the Brazilian Mastiff is a large working breed of dog developed in Brazil.It is known for its superb tracking ability, aggressiveness and an unforgiving impetuous temperament. When a Brazilian Mastiff finds its quarry, it does not attack it, but rather holds it at bay until the hunter arrives. Owing to these qualities, the Brazilian Mastiff is used as a guard dog, as a cattle dog for livestock and as a hunting dog for tracking and controlling large game. \nWhen slavery was legal in Brazil back in the 18th century, the Brazilian Mastiff was used to return fugitives unharmed to their slave masters. \nThis breed has been banned in many countries because of its temperament and potential for aggression.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe verb \"Filar\" in Portuguese literally means \"hold, arrest, grab\". So \"C\u00e3o de Fila\" (Fila dog) or \"C\u00e3o de filar\" suggests that it is a \"Catch dog\", a dog that \"bites and does not loosen its grip\". Similar name is also found in two Portuguese dog breeds: the C\u00e3o de Fila de S\u00e3o Miguel and the extinct C\u00e3o de fila da terceira.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere are several theories about which breeds gave rise to the Fila Brasileiro. The most widespread theory is that the breed is a combination between the English Mastiff, bloodhound and old bulldog of the 15th-century. But the most plausible theory is that the Fila is the result of the crossbreeding between portuguese and spanish dogs brought to Brazil during the Iberian Union period. In this case, the Fila would have as possible ascendents the Spanish mastiff, C\u00e3o de Castro Laboreiro, C\u00e3o de Gado Transmontano, Rafeiro do Alentejo, C\u00e3o Fila de S\u00e3o Miguel, etc, or the predecessor of these breeds (The Iberian Alaunt dog), possibly combined with Scent hound dogs. \nThe Fila Brasileiro breed was bred and raised primarily on large plantations and cattle farms where they originated. They were taught to chase down jaguars, cattle, and other animals, as well as runaway slaves. The dogs would grab the slave or animals by the neck and hold them until the farmer arrived. This instinct can be observed among puppies when they are playing.The first written standard of the breed was edited in 1946. The Paulistas were responsible for organizing a planned breeding program and opening a stud book to register dogs. Dr. Paulo Santos Cruz began to systematically breed the Fila Brasileiro and also contributed largely in setting the CAFIB standard, and who now therefore, has the right to be called the \"Father\" of the Fila Brasileiro.About the registries, CBKC (Brazilian Confederation Kennel Club) follows the FCI (Federation Cynologique Internationale) policy and accepts for registration only dogs with FCI pedigrees, orienting the breeders to make a hip dysplasia control and besides other health problems. The Fila Brasileiro is described as a Brazilian Mastiff or a Brazilian Molosser. In the U.S., the OFA (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals) does a statistical registry of all Filas that were X-rayed to diagnose hip dysplasia.\nThe Brazilian army compared this breed to Doberman Pinschers and German Shepherds in a five-year study using these dogs in the jungle under extremely hostile conditions.  The following traits were observed: intelligence, aggressiveness, sensibility, temperament, energy, resistance, rusticity and strength.  German Shepherds were found to have the highest intelligence and Doberman Pinschers the highest level of aggression.  The Fila Brasileiro was found to be superior in every other category.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nIn Brazil the breed has two main standards imposed by two distinct clubs, the CBKC (Brazilian Confederation of Cynophilia) affiliated to FCI, and the CAFIB (Fila Brasileiro's Enhancement Club). Consequently the stock of each club has visible morphological differences. The CAFIB standard was constructed based on the ancient phenotype of the breed. But the current CBKC/FCI standard is the best known internationally.The Fila Brasileiro is a Molosser breed with large bones and loose skin. The FCI breed standard requires males to be between 65 and 75 cm (25.5 inches to 29.5 inches) high at the withers and weigh 50 to 82 kilograms (110 to 181 lb). Females are slightly smaller and are expected to be 60 to 70 cm (23.5 inches to 27.5 inches) high at the withers and weigh at least 41 kg (90 lbs).  They have a rectangular build and though they are massive, their natural agility is apparent. The head is big and heavy with a deep muzzle.  The ears are large, thick, tapered and either droop or fold back exposing the interior, depending on mood.  Neck and back are well muscled, the chest is broad and deep.  Unlike the vast majority of canines, the croup is higher than the withers.  Legs are heavily boned. The skin is very distinctive of the breed as it is thick and loose all over the body, mainly in the region around the neck. The thick skin forms pronounced dewlaps. In many individuals, the dewlaps proceed to the chest and abdomen. Some dogs show a fold at the side of the head and also at the withers descending to the shoulders. The coat is short and dense and the texture is normally smooth and soft. Their colours vary from solid, brindle, mouse grey, patched, dappled or black and tan. They are almost never white. Typical colours are fawn, black and brindle. Brindles of a basic color may have the stripes of either less or with very strong intensity. Sometimes a black mask is present.Though large in size, the Fila does not appear static.  Rather it is harmonious, cat-like and above all powerful.  The Fila appears self-assured and calm but is never absent in expression.   When at attention, the gaze of the Fila Brasileiro is firm, alert and unwavering. Another typical characteristic of the breed is its gait, which is similar to that of a camel, moving two legs of one side at a time. The gait gives it a typical rolling lateral movement on the throat and the hindquarters which is accentuated when the dog's tail is raised. The head is typically lower than the backline. The characteristic carriage and gait has earned it great success in dog shows.\nThe coat of the Fila Brasileiro is smooth and short. Black, Fawns (Red, Apricot, or Dark), and Brindled (Fawn, Black, or Brown Brindle) colors are permitted, except Mouse-Grey, Black and Tan, Blue and Solid White. White markings, not exceeding 1/4 of the coat surface area, are permitted on the feet, chest, and the tip of the tail in the FCI standard.\nThe CAFIB standard does not accept black, mouse-grey, blue, dappled, or black-and-tan coats as it considers as a sign of crossbreeding, on the other hand it accepts dogs with large white markings on any part of the body.\n\n\n== Standards ==\nIn Brazil the Fila Brasileiro can be bred within three different standards proposed by three separate clubs. The standard imposed by the CBKC (a club affiliated to FCI) is the most popular in the world, but it is by far the most distant from the appearance of the old dogs of four decades ago.The other two standards are from CAFIB (Fila Brasileiro's Enhancement Club) and AMFIBRA (World Association of Dog Breeders of Fila Brasileiro), respectively. Both are based on the first breed standard elaborated by Paulo Santos Cruz, the man who is considered the \"father of the breed\". However, the CAFIB standard is the most popular of the two. But both clubs (CAFIB and AMFIBRA) present itselves with the aim to preserve the pure Fila with the closest appearance of the old dogs.This big difference between the standards is mainly due to an accusation of a scandal of crossbreeding at the dogs registered by the CBKC in the 70's, 80's and 90's, and consequently the many changes made in the CBKC standard probable to include the dogs with characteristics of foreign breeds, such as English Mastiff, Great Dane and Neapolitan Mastiff.Paulo Santos Cruz himself, who even participated in the formation of the CAFIB for these same reasons and even presided the club, published an article in 1979 explaining how to differentiate a pure Fila from a mixed one.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe Brazilian Mastiffs are known to be naturally protective. They are bred to be aggressive. It is also known for its extreme wariness of strangers and agility when protecting or defending its master. The dedication and obedience of the Fila Brasileiro has found its way into Brazilian saying \"As faithful as a Fila\".The Fila Brasileiro temperament is what characterizes the dog.  The Portuguese word for their temperament is Ojeriza, which directly translated into English means dislike and distrust. The socialization period (about the first year with the first 6\u20138 months being the most important) of the dog's life is crucial to the temperament of the individual dog. If the pup is exposed to a lot of people in a positive manner (known as 'socializing'), the pup (keeping in mind the dog's natural protective instincts) can be encouraged to behave in a calm manner in public, but emphasis should be placed on the fact that socialization is done differently from other breeds. Despite extensive socialization, the fila is instinctively protective and will naturally guard and protect its owner, their family members and the family pets; this is not something that needs to be trained, it is an innate trait. Strangers should not be left unattended with a Fila and, like all other guardian breeds, it may not be the best choice for those who have frequent visitors to their homes.  Lack of all socialization with strangers at a young age will result in a dog which is very anti-social.\n\n\n== Common ailments ==\nBrazilian Mastiffs are prone to large breed ailments, including hip dysplasia, gastric torsion and elbow dysplasia. The dogs are often prone to bloat or gastric volvulus distension. These dogs require plenty of exercise and hence are not very well suited to city life. Open country with fenced yards are very good for the dogs as it gives them plenty of room to run and exercise.\n\n\n== Life expectancy ==\nFilas are known to live up to about nine to eleven years.\n\n\n== Legal status ==\nIn Fiji, United Kingdom Norway, Malta and Cyprus it is illegal to own any of these dogs without specific exemption from a court. In Australia, in the states of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia the Fila is a restricted or proscribed breed. Imports are also prohibited. They are automatically classified as a dangerous dog in New Zealand and Trinidad & Tobago, meaning they cannot be imported and males must be neutered.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGuard dog\nBrazilian Dogge\nBrazilian Terrier\nCampeiro Bulldog\nGaucho sheepdog\nBullbras (New age bulldogge, or Brazilian bulldog)\nC\u00e3o de Fila de S\u00e3o Miguel\nTerceira Mastiff\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCAFIB (in English)\nFila Brasileiro Association (in English)"}, {"id": 194, "name": "Finnish Hound", "country": "Finland", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog194", "description": "The Finnish Hound (suomenajokoira, Finnish Bracke) is a breed of dog originally bred for hunting hare and fox.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe nob of the Finnish Hound is short, dense and coarse to the touch. The coat pattern is tricolor with tan, a black saddle and small white markings on head, feet, chest and tail tip. Height is commonly 20-24 inches (52\u201361 cm) and weight 45-55 pounds (20\u201325 kg).\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Finnish Hound is friendly, calm and never aggressive. It is energetic in the hunt and is a versatile tracker. It works independently and pursues the quarry with passionate barking.\n\n\n== Care ==\n\n\n=== Exercise ===\nFinnish Hounds are energetic working dogs with great stamina. They need long, brisk daily walking, and plenty of running and playing free. Life expectancy is about 12 years.\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\nThe smooth, short haired coat is easy to maintain. The brushing can be done with a firm bristle brush, and dry shampoo may be used occasionally if needed. The coat does not need bathing unless extremely dirty. Finnish hounds are average shedders.\n\n\n=== Cerebellar ataxia ===\nFinnish Hounds suffer from an inherited disease, cerebellar ataxia, forcing people to euthanize many puppies. This has been traced to a single mutation in a gene called SEL1L. Mutant cells suffer disruptions in their endoplasmic reticula, leading to disease. It is hoped that a test will be developed to screen for this mutation and eventually breed it out of the population.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Finnish Hound was a result of a breeding programme in the 1800s, which involved French, German and Swedish hounds. The goal was to develop a hound dog that could work on hilly terrain and in deep snow. The Finnish Hound has become one of Finland's most popular dog breeds. Although the breed is very popular in Finland and Sweden, it is quite uncommon elsewhere.\n\n\n== See also ==\nScenthound\nAlpine Dachsbracke\nWestphalian Dachsbracke\nDrever\nScenthound Group\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 195, "name": "Finnish Lapphund", "country": "Finland", "type": "Northern Breed", "picture": "dog195", "description": "The Finnish Lapphund is a hardy, easy going, medium-size breed of Spitz type. Traditionally it has been used for herding reindeer. Although it is one of the most popular dog breeds in its native country, Finland, it is not very numerous outside of the Nordic countries.\n\n\n== Lineage ==\nThe breed falls under the mitochondrial DNA sub-clade referred to as d1 that is only found in northern Scandinavia. It is the result of a female wolf-male dog hybridization that occurred post-domestication. Subclade d1 originated 480-3,000 years ago and is found in all Sami-related breeds: Finnish Lapphund, Swedish Lapphund, Lapponian Herder, Jamthund, Norwegian Elkhound and H\u00e4llefors Elkhound. The maternal wolf sequence that contributed to these breeds has not been matched across Eurasia and its branch on the phylogenetic tree is rooted in the same sequence as the 33,000 year-old Altai dog (not a direct ancestor).\nRefer: Ancient dog-wolf hybridization\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Finnish Lapphund is a medium-sized, strongly-built dog.  It has a profuse coat with pricked, highly mobile ears, distinctive markings and an elegant nose.\nColours of black:cream, tan, white and gray, brown and white also brown and cream. There is also a pear black, white and gray. \nThe breed standard is 46 to 52 centimetres (18 to 20 in) at the withers for a male, and a slightly smaller 41 to 47 centimetres (16 to 19 in) for a female.  However, some variation is allowed, since the breed standard states that the type is more important than the size.  A typical male of 49 cm height normally weighs 17 to 19 kilograms (37 to 42 lb), but the breed has a weight range of 15 to 24 kilograms (33 to 53 lb), depending on the size of the dog.\nThe Lapphund has a profuse double coat, with a short, fluffy undercoat and a longer topcoat. The coat makes the dog waterproof as well as resistant to extreme cold. In Finland, only two dog breeds are legally allowed to be kenneled outdoors in winter: the Finnish Lapphund and the Lapponian herder. The profuse hair around the head and neck gives the distinct impression of a mane in most males.  Although the coat is profuse, it requires only a modest amount of maintenance. Weekly brushing is recommended throughout the year, except during shedding seasons, where a daily brush may be required.\nA wide variety of colors and markings are found in Finnish Lapphunds. Any colour is allowed in the breed standard, although a single colour should predominate. One of the most common colour combination's is black and tan: a predominantly black dog with tan legs and face. Common colourations may include cr\u00e8me, black, red, brown, sable and wolf-sable. In descending order of dominance, the following genes in certain series correspond to specific colourations:A series (Agouti):\n\nAy: dominant yellow or sable (which produces various types of red and sable)\naw: wolf sable or grizzle\nas:saddle\nat: black and tan\na: recessive blackB series (brown)\nC series (colour):\n\nC: CC pairing displays deep rich tan\nCe: not fully defined (potential lightening effect)\ncch: Chincilla (lightens yellow to cream or faw)E series (extension)\n\nEm: black mask\nE: no black mask\nEbr: brindle\ne: conversion/fading of black to yellowMany Finnish Lapphunds have very distinctive facial markings. One of the unusual facial markings is \"spectacles\", where a ring of lighter coloured hair around the eyes gives the impression that the dog is wearing spectacles. The spectacles of the Finnish Lapphund, while reminiscent of their cousins, the Keeshond, are larger and more pronounced. Like other spitz types, the tail is carried curving over the back. The Finnish Lapphund has a tail covered with thick, long hair. The tail may hang whilst the dog stands.\n\nThe Finnish Lapphund is a recognized breed in Finland, Europe, Great Britain, Australia and the United States.  The breed standards are mostly identical, with a few minor exceptions: in the English standard, the acceptance of tipped ears is omitted.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Finnish Lapphund is a very intelligent and active breed.  Finnish Lapphunds take well to training due to their intelligence.  Some owners and fanciers claim that \"Lappies\" even have the ability to think through actions first.  Although small in number worldwide, a noticeable number of Finnish Lapphunds have excelled in activities such as obedience trials, agility, herding trials, and pet therapy.\nThe breed is friendly and alert, and makes a good watch dog, due to its tendency to bark at unfamiliar things.  The breed was originally used to herd reindeer by droving, and barking helped it to be distinguished from wolves.  Even when not herding, the Finnish Lapphund tends to bark with a purpose, and more rare cases of problem barking can normally be controlled by training.\nThe breed makes the ideal outdoor companion.  It is active, coldproof, and waterproof, and will gladly accompany people on walking or running trips. A slight independent streak is common, though with training Finnish Lapphunds can have excellent recall and obedience skills.\nLappies are ideal choice for a family with small children. The breed adapts well to family life, including being responsive to children.  Finnish Lapphunds have a gentle nature with children, people with disabilities, and the elderly. This is a very friendly breed and it normally avoids and flees from threatening situations. The breed is very curious, so some supervision is recommended.\n\nIn Finland, many Finnish Lapphunds have won national championships for obedience and lappies are also suitable for agility.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe Finnish Lapphund can compete in dog agility trials, carting, mushing, obedience, Rally obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Lapphunds exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Finnish Lapphund is a naturally healthy breed, and typically lives 12\u201314 years, although dogs of 16\u201317 years are not uncommon in Finland.Known medical issues include Generalised progressive retinal atrophy (GPRA) and hereditary cataracts.\n\nGPRA is a progressive eye disease that can cause permanent blindness in dogs. In the Finnish Lapphund, this tends to be late onset, but can typically appear between the ages of 1 and 8 years. GPRA is a genetic illness, and is transmitted via an autosomal recessive gene. A reliable genetic test for the prcd-form of GRPA has been developed by OptiGen, and breeders are increasingly testing breeding animals before deciding on suitable mating pairs. The Finnish Lapphund club of Great Britain adopted an ethical policy in 2006 that matings will only be allowed if the progeny can not be affected by GPRA. In 2001, 2.5% dogs of Finnish dogs were affected by PRA.\nSome Lapphunds are affected by cataracts, with 3.4% of Finnish dogs affected. Cataracts can be caused by a number of factors, and the mode of inheritance is not yet well understood. Since the incidence in Finland is relatively high, the disease is considered to be hereditary. In the UK and USA the number of affected dogs is very small.\nThe ethical standard in most countries require the stud dogs to be hip-scored, but the incidence of hip dysplasia is low.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe breed has its origins as a reindeer herder of the Sami people. The Sami are an indigenous people residing in areas now divided between Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Russia. Traditionally, reindeer herding has been very important for the Sami people, and they are still involved in herding today. The Sami have used herding dogs for centuries, and these dogs were typically long in body, somewhat rectangular in shape, with long hair and a straight tail that would curl up over the back when the dog was moving. Finnish Lapphunds are the most similar to the long haired dogs developed by the Sami people in order to assist them with herding, often favored as winter herders for the reindeer.Norwegians and Swedes were among the first to consider standardizing the dogs of Lapland prior to World War II. In the post war years, the dogs of Lapland were at serious risk due to distemper outbreak. Swedish Lapphund breeders today believe that their breed, and other Lapphund breeds, were in serious danger of extinction. A standard for the related Swedish Lapphund was adopted in 1944 in FCI (Federation Cynologique Internationale), and the Finnish Lapphund standard soon followed.\nIn Finland, the first breed standards were set in 1945 by the Finnish Kennel Club, who called the breed the Lappish Herder, also known as Kukonharjunlainen. It is believed that these dogs were the result of a cross between the Karelian Bear Dog and the reindeer dogs, and had short hair. In the 1950s the Finnish Kennel Association (the second major kennel association in Finland) created the first breed standard for the Lapponian herder. Acceptable colours for this breed were black, bear-brown and white.\n\nIn the 1960s, the various Finnish kennel associations were unified, and in 1966 the breeds were reassessed. This resulted in the formal definition of two breeds: the Lapponian herder with a shorter coat was defined in 1966, and the longer coated Finnish Lapphund was defined in 1967.At about the same time, technology enabled changes in the lifestyle of the Sami herders.  Previously, the longer-haired dogs were generally preferred for herding, but with the advent of snowmobiles, the preference started to change in favour of the shorter haired Lapponian herder.  However, popularity did not die for the longer-haired breed, which as of 2014 was ranked the sixth most popular companion animal in Finland.The first American litter was born in 1988. In 1994, the breed was recognised by the United Kennel Club (UKC), the second largest kennel club in America, in the Northern Group. The breed was accepted into the AKC Miscellaneous Group on July 1, 2009 and became a fully recognized breed in the Herding Group on June 30, 2011.  The Finnish Lapphund Club of America (FLCA) is the parent organization in the United States and was awarded parent club status on November 25, 2015, thus allowing it to hold licensed championship point events.The breed was first introduced to the United Kingdom in 1989 and is represented by the Finnish Lapphund Club of Great Britain. It was introduced to Australia and Canada in 1995 and is accepted by the New Zealand Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club. In Canada, its parent club is the Finnish Lapphund Club of Canada.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSwedish Lapphund\nLapponian Herder\nFinnish Spitz\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBooks\n\nJackson, Toni (2003).

The breed was originally bred to hunt all types of game from squirrels and other rodents to bears.  It is a \"bark pointer\", indicating the position of game by barking, and drawing the game animal's attention to itself, allowing an easier approach for the hunter. Its original game hunting purpose was to point to game that fled into trees, such as grouse, and capercaillies, but it also serves well for hunting elk. Some individuals have even been known to go after a bear. In its native country, the breed is still mostly used as a hunting dog. The breed is friendly and in general loves children, so it is suitable for domestic life. The Finnish Spitz has been the national dog of Finland since 1979.\n\n\n== Lineage ==\nThe remains of dogs that have been found in Finland and dated from 8,000 years ago are similar in size and shape to Spitz-type dogs.Nearly all dog breeds\u2019 genetic closeness to the gray wolf is due to admixture. However, several Arctic dog breeds show a genetic closeness with the now-extinct Taymyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture. These breeds are associated with high latitudes - the Siberian husky and Greenland dog that are also associated with arctic human populations, and to a lesser extent the Shar Pei and the Karelo-Finnish Laika. An admixture graph of the Greenland dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material, however an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data. This indicates admixture between the Taymyr wolf population and the ancestral dog population of these 4 high-latitude breeds. This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Finnish Spitz developed from selectively bred Spitz-type dogs that inhabited central Russia several thousand years ago.  Isolated Finno-Ugrian tribes in the far northern regions bred dogs according to their specific needs.  These small clans of woodsmen relied on their dogs to help them obtain food, and the excellent hunting ability of the Finnish Spitz made it a favorite choice.By 1880, as advanced means of transportation brought diverse peoples and their dogs together, Finnish Spitzes mated with other breeds of dogs, and were becoming extinct as a distinct breed.  At about that time, a Finnish sportsman from Helsinki named Hugo Roos observed the pure native Finnish Spitz while hunting in the northern forests.  He realized the many virtues of the pure Finnish Spitz breed and decided to select dogs that were untainted examples of the genuine Finnish Spitz in order to try to revive the breed.  Thirty years of careful breeding resulted in the modern Finnish Spitz; the dogs are descendants of his original foundation stock.\nLove \nFinnish Kennel Club has revised the breed standard six times, and the latest version was confirmed in 1996. In 1979, when the club celebrated its 90th anniversary, the Finnish Spitz was declared Finland\u2019s national dog breed. The club  is also working for including the hunting experience with the Finnish Spitz on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe proper conformation is a square build, meaning that the length of the body is the same or slightly shorter than the height of the withers to the ground.  The length of the body is measured from the point of the shoulder or forechest in front of the withers to the rump.  Females are usually a little longer in the back than males.  Both sexes should appear slightly longer in the leg than the back.\nDew claws can appear on front and/or back feet.  If back claws appear, they should be removed.  The front dewclaws can be removed, if desired.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nThe Finnish Spitz has a typical double coat, which consists of a soft, dense undercoat and long, harsh guard hairs that can measure one to two inches (2.5 to 5 cm) long. The outer coat should not exceed 2.5 inches (64 mm) at the ruff. The coat should be stiffer, denser, and longer on the neck, back, back of thighs, and plume of the tail, shorter on the head and legs. Male dogs should sport a slightly longer and coarser coat than female ones, who have a slightly more refined coat.\nThe pluma of the tail is important to the overall look of the dog but should not be too long.  Feathered long tail hairs without sustenance can give the dog an unkempt look.  Additionally, the tailset is important and the Finnish Spitz should be able to move its tail from one side to the other.  Most Finnish Spitz have a preferred side and this is not incorrect.\nProper care of the coat is most important.  The Finnish Spitz blows coat or loses its undercoat twice a year.  It is imperative that owners brush out the old undercoat so the new coat can grow properly.  Although a dog may look fluffy and full, excessive undercoat may be causing serious skin problems.\nIn the show ring, the coat should be shown as completely natural; a brush through the coat is acceptable, but no trimming is allowed, not even of whiskers. However, any excessive undercoat should be removed. Some exhibitors choose to show dogs with excessive undercoat to make the dog's coat appear more lush.  Failing to shed undercoat is considered neglect by some judges who prefer a clean and combed coat.  Another exception is the hair under the bottom of the feet. The hair under the feet as well as the toe nails should be nicely trimmed for show.\n\n\n=== Color ===\n\nPuppies are often described as looking similar to a red fox cub. They are born dark grey, black, brown, or fawn with a vast amount of black.  A fawn-colored puppy or one with a large amount of white of the chest is not preferable for show purposes.  The color of the adult dog can be assessed by an experienced breeder at birth, but even then, the color may change slightly as the puppy grows.The adult color is typically a golden-red with variations from pale honey to dark chestnut. There is no preference for a particular shade as long as the color is bright and clear with no hints of dullness. The coat should never be a solid color. It should be shaded and without any defined color changes. The coat is usually at its darkest shade on the back of the dog, gradually getting lighter around the chest and belly. The undercoat must always be lighter in color than the topcoat, but is never allowed to be white. A small patch of white, no more than 0.6 inches (1.5 cm) wide, is allowable on the chest, and white tips on the feet are acceptable, but not desired.The nose, lips, and rims of eyes should always be black.\n\n\n=== Height and weight ===\nHeight at withers (American Kennel Club breed standard):\n\nMales: 17\u00bd to 20 inches (44.5 to 50.8 cm)\nFemales: 15\u00bd to 18 inches (39.4 to 45.7 cm)Weight:\n\nMales: 26\u201330 lb (12\u201314 kg)\nFemales: 16\u201322 lb (7.3\u201310.0 kg)\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThis breed is active, alert and lively.  They need one or two long walks each day and will be fairly inactive indoors.  This breed will not adapt well to a strictly kenneled living situation; they need a balance of outdoor exercise and indoor play time with the family.Finnish Spitzes are considered to interact well with people and they are especially good with children.  They are always ready to play with children but if ignored, they will usually walk away.  As with all dogs, young children and dogs should always be supervised when together. It is an independent breed and will be attached to its family while remaining aloof with strangers.  The Finnish Spitz tends to be protective; males have more domineering traits than females.\nMost Finnish Spitzes get along well with other dogs in the house.  They are bred as a hunting dog and thus are unreliable around small animals and pet birds, but on an individual basis may live well with cats, especially if they're raised with them.\n\n\n=== Barking ===\nThe breed barks at anything perceived to be out of the ordinary. Barking is a major part of their hunting activities.  In Finland, these dogs are prized for their barking abilities, which can range from short, sharp barks to many barks per minute that sound like a yodel. The Finnish Spitz can bark as many as 160 times per minute.  In Scandinavia, a competition is held to find the \"King of the Barkers.\"  In Finland, their barking ability in the field must be proven before a conformation championship can be earned.When used as a hunting companion, the barking is a way to signal the hunter that the dog has located prey in the forest.  They can be trained to reduce the amount of barking, although the barking does make them superb watchdogs.\n\n\n=== Training ===\nFinnish Spitzes are independent, strong-willed, intelligent dogs.  They are best trained with a soft voice and touch. This breed will not respond well to harsh training methods. They should be trained with a light touch and positive reinforcement methods.  With patience and calm yet firm handling, the Finnish Spitz can be a wonderful companion.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Finnish Spitz is typically a very healthy breed, with few general health concerns. However, breeders should be consulted to understand the prevalence of a specific disorder in this breed. Below is a short list of what is known to occur:\n\nHip dysplasia\nPatellar luxation\nElbow dysplasia\nEpilepsyMedian lifespan is about 11.2 years.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMorris, Desmond.

It was developed as a retriever both on land and in the water.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Flat-Coated Retriever breed standard calls for males to be 23\u201325 in (58\u201364 cm) tall at the withers, with a recommended weight of 60\u201380 lb (27\u201336 kg), and for females to be 22\u201324 in (56\u201361 cm), with a recommended weight of 55\u201375 lb (25\u201334 kg). The Flat-Coated Retriever has strong muscular jaws and a relatively long muzzle. Its head is unique to the breed and is described as being \"of one piece\" with a minimal stop and a backskull of about the same length as the muzzle. It has almond-shaped, dark brown eyes with an intelligent, friendly expression. The ears are pendant, relatively small, and lie close to the head. The occiput (the bone at the back of the skull) is not to be accentuated (as it is in setters, for example) with the head flowing smoothly into a well-arched neck. The topline is strong and straight with a well-feathered tail of moderate length held straight off the back. This breed should be well-angulated front and rear, allowing for open, effortless movement. It is lighter, racier, and more elegant in appearance than the other retriever breeds.   \n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Flat-Coated Retriever is an active, multitalented bird dog with a strong desire to please people. Exuberant, confident, and outgoing, they make a loving family pet and can be companions to small children, provided adults are nearby to direct this dog's boisterous enthusiasm. These retrievers require plenty of exercise and engagement to help channel their natural sporting energy. The British Kennel Club recommendeds that owners provide dogs with at least 2 hours of exercise a day. While they will protect their owners and property with an assertive bark, they are unlikely to back up such noise with actual aggression. Because of their excellent sense of smell, combined with their boundless energy and eagerness to please their masters, they are sometimes used as drug-sniffer dogs. They are used in the breeding program for The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association in the UK, both as a breed and as cross-breeds with the Labrador Retriever Eager and quick to learn, they are best trained in short intervals, as they may bore with repetition. The Flat-Coated Retriever is a slow maturing dog, as they do not reach full maturity until 3\u20135 years of age. Even then, these dogs retain their youthful, puppy-like outlook and demeanor well into old age. Paddy Petch, author of The Complete Flat-Coated Retriever, refers to these dogs as the \"Peter Pan\" of the retriever breeds, given they never quite grow up.The Flat-Coated Retriever is a \"natural\" breed and enjoys partaking in \"natural\" activities such as rolling in feces, playing in mud, and digging. These dogs are also \"thinking\" dogs, meaning they want to please but look for a way to bend the rules. This characteristic helps with their hunting ability but only if they are bonded with their owner. These dogs will work for themselves or not at all if there is no motivation to work with the handler or dog-handler bond present.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOriginating in the mid-19th century in England, the Flat-Coated Retriever gained popularity as a gamekeeper\u2019s dog. Part of its ancestry is thought to have come from stock imported from North America from the now extinct St. John's water dog, but this is unverified. Canadian seafarers are thought to have brought Newfoundlands to British ports, and they factored into the ancestry of the Flat-Coated Retriever. Collie-type dogs may have been added to increase the breed's trainability along with the Newfoundland for strength and Setter blood for enhanced scenting ability. The first examples of the breed were introduced around 1860, but the final type was only established 20 years later.After its introduction into the U.S., the Flat-Coated Retriever began to quickly gain in popularity as a gun dog, and from 1873 when the breed became a \"stable type\" according to the American Kennel Club until 1915 when it was officially recognised as a breed, \ntheir number grew rapidly. However, soon after, their popularity began to decrease, eclipsed by the Golden Retriever, which was actually bred in part from the Flat-Coated Retriever, along with other breeds. By the end of World War II, so few Flat-Coated Retrievers remained, the breed's survival was uncertain. However, beginning in the 1960s, careful breeding brought the population back and the breed gained in popularity again, for both the sport of conformation showing, and as a companion pet. Today, the Flat-Coated Retriever enjoys a modest popularity and is moving ahead as a breed through attentive breeding for the conformation, health, multipurpose talent, and exceptional temperament that are its hallmarks. It has yet to return in substantial numbers to field competition.\nIn 2011, 'Sh Ch. Vbos The Kentuckian' (aka Jet), a 9.5-year-old Flat-Coated Retriever from South Queensferry, near Edinburgh, Scotland, won Best in Show at Crufts.Almanza Far and Flyg (a.k.a. Simon), from Oslo, Norway, won the Gundog Group at Crufts in 2007. \nBefore that in 2003, a Swedish dog 'Inkwells Named Shadow' had also won the Gundog Group. The last UK dog to win the Gundog Group at Crufts was \"Sh Ch Gayplume Dream-maker\" in 2002. The only other Flat-Coated Retriever to win Best in Show at Crufts was 'Ch. Shargleam Blackcap' in 1980. These wins have contributed to the breed's popularity in Europe and the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Health ==\nRegular tests and clearances for hereditary joint conditions such as hip dysplasia, deafness, and eye conditions such as progressive retinal atrophy and glaucoma should be conducted by breeders on any dogs used for breeding. Occasionally, epilepsy is also seen in the breed.\nFlat-Coated Retrievers have a higher risk of cancer than most dogs. Hemangiosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and malignant histiocytosis are particularly devastating, and occur at higher rates in them than in many other breeds. According to studies sponsored by the Flat-Coated Retriever Society of America (FCRSA), \nthe average lifespan of the Flat-coated Retriever is only about eight years, with a high percentage of deaths due to cancer. More recent surveys in Denmark and the UK show a median lifespan around 10 years. A health survey of purebred dogs in the UK from 2010 showed approximately 50% of Flat Coated Retrievers death were due to some form of cancer.Another more common affliction amongst Flat-Coated Retrievers is gastric dilatation and volvulus, otherwise known as bloat. This is not specific to Flat-Coats but it is common due to their large size and deep chests. If left untreated, the dog will die quickly. Gastric dilatation and volvulus is responsible for 5% of all Flat-Coated Retriever deaths and around 20% of non-tumour related deaths.Flat-Coated Retrievers have a very low rate of hip dysplasia and luxating patellas compared to other medium-sized breeds; the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals statistics consistently show a rate of hip dysplasia in the breed of less than 3%. In the 1997 FCRSA health survey, 4.2% of males and 3.2% of females had been diagnosed with luxating patellae.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCurly-Coated Retriever\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFlat-Coated Retriever at Curlie"}, {"id": 198, "name": "Smooth Fox Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog198", "description": "The Smooth Fox Terrier is a breed of dog, one of many terrier breeds. It was the first breed in the fox terrier family to be given official recognition by The Kennel Club (circa 1875; breed standard 1876).  It is well known, and although not a widely popular breed today outside hunting and show circles, it is extremely significant due to the large number of terriers believed descended from it.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe Smooth Fox Terrier's development as a breed is largely undocumented, but the dog has been known as a distinct breed in England since at least the 18th century; the first documented evidence of the Smooth Fox Terrier came in 1790, when a Colonel Thornton painted a portrait of his dog, Pitch.\n\n\n=== Recognition ===\nThe Smooth Fox Terrier entered the show ring during the mid-19th century, making it one of the earliest entrants in such events. The American Kennel Club recognized the Fox Terrier in 1885; one hundred years later, the Smooth Fox Terrier was recognized as being a distinct breed from the Wire Fox Terrier. \n\nConventional wisdom long held that the Smooth Fox Terrier and Wire Fox Terrier are variations of the same breed; in recent years, however, an increasing number of experts have stated the opinion that the two breeds are not related at all. Whereas the Wire Fox Terrier is probably directly descended from the Rough Black and Tan Terrier of Wales, the Smooth Fox Terrier is thought to count the Smooth Black and Tan Terrier as its primary ancestor, with traces of Beagle and Bull Terrier thrown in as well.\nHowever, the two breeds were considered to be varieties of one breed and were occasionally interbred until the mid-1980s when the AKC changed them from varieties to separate breeds. All modern Smooth Fox Terriers trace back to wires many times, from Eng. Ch Watteau Chorister, through Eng. Ch. Lethal Weapon, Eng. Ch. Corrector of Notts and Eng. Ch. Cromwell Ochre's Legacy back to Dusky D'Orsay. Bred by Mr. Francis Redmond, Dusky D'Orsay's sire was a Wire, Dusky Collar, and her dam a Smooth, Eng. Ch. D'Orsay's Donna. Through Dusky D'Orsay, all modern Smooths trace back to several famous Wires, including Ch. Cackler Of Notts and Meersbrook Bristles.\nThe Smooth Fox Terrier's historic profession is fox bolting. A fox bolting dog will accompany a pack of foxhounds and \"bolt\" after foxes, driving them out from their hiding spots and into the line of sight of the larger dogs and men on horses. Smooth Fox Terriers with white coats were less likely to be mistaken for the fox in close combat situations, and were therefore more highly prized.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Smooth Fox Terrier is a highly energetic dog, and thus not recommended for first time dog owners. As the breed was originally bred to go after small animals they also have a high prey instinct, they are very friendly dogs and don't mind strangers.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Smooth Fox Terrier generally lives 12 to 15 years, and can live as long as 19 years.  The breed is genetically quite healthy.  Some known health problems are deafness, luxating patellas and a variety of eye disorders such as lens luxation, distichiasis, and cataracts. Skeletal problems that can occur include Legge-Perthes disease and shoulder dislocations.  Myasthenia Gravis and idiopathic epilepsy have also been reported, as well as goiter.\n\n\n== Grooming ==\n\nThe Smooth Fox Terrier is a low-maintenance dog in terms of grooming. Hair grows all over the entire body equally, so to have the smooth clean look areas must be scissored or clippered.  For normal pet maintenance, brushing the coat, keeping the nails trimmed, and cleaning the hair out of the pads of the feet is important. Brushing teeth is also recommended, a dog's bite is very important to its health.  Getting your Smooth Fox Terrier used to grooming at an early age is recommended for it will be easier for you the owner to do so throughout your dog's life.  Smooth Fox Terriers are known for enjoying the attention that is brought to them while grooming.\n\n\n== Notable Smooth-haired Fox Terriers ==\nNipper, mascot of HMV and RCA; some commercials featured him portrayed as a Smooth Fox Terrier, though the original dog was a Jack Russell Terrier mixed breed.\nSnitter, protagonist from the novel The Plague Dogs, written by Richard Adams\nTitina, travelled with Umberto Nobile on Airship Norge and Airship Italia\nSkip, from the book My Dog Skip by Willie Morris (played by a Jack Russell Terrier in the film of the same name)\nDash,  seven consequent dogs (among them, six smooth Fox Terriers) of Sir Aurel Stein, who accompanied him in archeological expeditions to Xinjiang, Iran and other countries in the early 20th century\nIgloo, pet of explorer Richard E. Byrd.  Igloo frequently accompanied Byrd on his trips to Antarctica.\nAngus and India are the Smooth Fox Terriers of Fashion Designer and Film Director Tom Ford, they also have appeared in his Oscar nominated film, A Single Man and on the runway of his fashion show.\nJohn was the late Smooth Fox Terrier of Fashion Designer Tom Ford and [John] was featured with Tom Ford on the front page of i-D magazine in 2001.\nKvik in the Danish TV series Matador.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFox Terrier, for additional details on history, genetics, coat color, and so on.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSmooth Fox Terrier at Curlie"}, {"id": 199, "name": "Wire Fox Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog199", "description": "The Wire Fox Terrier  is a breed of dog, one of many terrier breeds. It is a fox terrier, and although it bears a resemblance to the Smooth Fox Terrier, they are believed to have been developed separately.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Wire Fox Terrier is a sturdy, balanced dog weighing 7.7 to 8.6 kg (17 to 19 lb) for males and 6.8 to 7.7 kg (15 to 17 lb) for females.  It should not be more than 39 cm (15 1\u20442 in) at the withers.  Its rough, broken coat is distinctive.  Coat color consists of a predominant white base with brown markings of the face and ears, and usually a black saddle or large splotch of color; there may be other black or brown markings on the body.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nTwo of the wire fox terrier's most distinctive traits are its energy and intelligence. It has a low threshold for boredom and requires stimulation, exercise and attention. The wire fox terrier is a companion animal that requires near-constant attention. \nThe dog should be alert, quick and ready to respond swiftly with enthusiasm. However, they should also be friendly, communicative, and playful if they receive the proper care and exercise. Bred to be independent thinkers, they are capable of tactical maneuvering for vermin and other sport.\nOften, wire fox terriers are abandoned or surrendered for reasons that may include: running away instead of coming on a command; chasing cars, bicycles, other dogs, etc.; or taunting and then attacking other animals, including a household's cats and other dogs \u2013and they are able to do serious damage. But these are actually normal behaviors for a breed designed to hunt not only foxes, but also badgers and boars, with no more fear of cows or buses than they have of small prey. Keeping one as a pet requires firm control to redirect these prey instincts and provide the dog with enough exercise and diversion. With diligent supervision, wire fox terriers can be amusing, exciting, long-lived companion animals.\n\n\n== Grooming ==\n\nWire fox terriers kept for show are hand stripped; if the hair becomes too long, it is taken out by hand in order to preserve the colors and the glossiness of the coat.  Many kept as pets are clipped monthly by a groomer.  Clipping dulls the colors and makes the coat soft, curly and more difficult to keep clean, but it is preferred by many owners due to being a simpler (and cheaper) procedure than stripping.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe wire fox terrier was developed in England by fox hunting enthusiasts and is believed to be descended from a now-extinct rough-coated, black-and-tan working terrier of Wales, Derbyshire, and Durham. The breed was also thought to have been bred to chase foxes into their underground burrows; the dogs' short, strong, usually docked tails were used as handles by the hunter to pull them back out.\n\nAlthough it is said Queen Victoria owned one, and her son and heir, King Edward VII, did own a wire fox terrier named Caesar, the breed was not popular as a family pet until the 1930s, when The Thin Man series of feature films was created.  Asta, the canine member of the Charles family, was a wire fox terrier, and the popularity of the breed soared. Milou (Snowy) from The Adventures of Tintin comic strip is also a wire fox terrier.\nIn the late 20th century, the popularity of the breed declined again, most likely due to changing living conditions in the Western world and the difficulty of keeping hunting terriers in cities due to their strong prey instincts.\nAs of 2014, the wire fox terrier has the distinction of having received more Best in Show titles at Westminster Kennel Club dog shows (currently 14) than any other breed. Matford Vic, a wire fox terrier, is one of only five dogs to have won the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on more than one occasion. She won the competition twice, in 1915 and 1916. The only dog to win it on more occasions was Warren Remedy, a smooth fox terrier, who won it on three occasions between 1907 and 1909.\n\n\n== Noteworthy wire fox terriers ==\nArchie, owned by Gill Raddings Stunt Dogs, starred in ITV's Catwalk Dogs.\nAsta, from The Thin Man film series\nBeauty, awarded the Dickin Medal for conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving in military conflict.\nBob, from the Hercule Poirot episode Dumb Witness\nBunny, from Hudson Hawk\nBella, who played Snoopy in the movie Moonrise Kingdom\nBoer, the dog of Alexei Brusilov, the author of the 'Brusilov Offensive'.\nCaesar, the companion of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom\nCharles, brought to Ceylon by Leonard Woolf in 1905\nChester, in the film Jack Frost\nD\u00e1\u0161e\u0148ka, the dog of Czechoslovak writer and journalist Karel \u010capek - also featured as the hero of his book D\u00e1\u0161e\u0148ka \u010dili \u017eivot \u0161t\u011bn\u011bte\nDodger Herbie Tobacco (only a mutt in the film) from \"Oliver & Company\" is actually a Wire Fox Terrier.\nFeatherstonehaugh (pronounced 'Foon'), \"a wire-haired fox terrier of irreproachable breeding\" from Margery Allingham's novel Police at the Funeral.\nGuido from Pups United\nIke Larue, from the Ike Larue series, written and illustrated by Mark Teague\nJ.D. from Millionaire Dogs\nJani, owned by Vincent Korda, mentioned by his son Michael Korda in \"Alone\" (2017)\nMickey, the companion of French composer Francis Poulenc.\nMoll, from the book Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man\nMontmorency, from the book Three Men in a Boat by Jerome K.

Although it is often referred to as a spaniel, the breed's working characteristics are more akin to those of a pointer or setter. Brittanys were developed in the Brittany province of France between the 17th and 19th centuries, becoming officially recognized early in the 20th.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe name \"Brittany\" is taken from the Brittany region in northwestern France where the dog originated. Images of orange and white Brittany-like dogs hunting and retrieving game were first seen on tapestries and paintings from the 17th century. The first written and verifiable record of Brittanys comes from a hunting description written by Reverend Davies in 1850. He described hunting with small \"bobtailed\" dogs who pointed and were excellent retrievers. It was around the same time that the modern Brittany is rumored to have been bred by mating with English Setters. The Brittany was first shown at the Paris Dog Show in 1900.The Brittany was first recognized as a breed in 1907 when an orange and white male named Boy was registered in France. As a result, the first standards were outlined in the same year. America recognized the Brittany in 1931 and the breed was approved by the American Kennel Club in 1934. In 1982 the \"Spaniel\" was officially dropped from the name.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Brittany is typically quite athletic, compact, energetic, and solidly built without being heavy.  Their heads are of average size with floppy ears, expressions usually of intelligence, vigour, and alertness, and gait elastic, long, and free.\nMost Brittanys are born with naturally short tails, yet others are rarely born with long tails, which are docked to a length of 3\u201310 centimetres (1.2\u20133.9 in)\nThe breed's coat color is varied: orange and white coat or liver and white are most common in the American Brittany; other colors include orange roan and liver roan, all of which are acceptable in the show ring. The American Brittany Standard specifies an acceptable tri-color of liver, orange, and white with very specific color placement.\n\n\n=== Size ===\nBrittanys are medium-sized dogs, with American lines (17.5\u201320.5 inches (44\u201352 cm) at the withers according to an AKC standard adopted in 1990) tending to be larger and have a blockier head than French (17\u201320.5 inches (43\u201352 cm)), and females at the lower end. A properly constructed and healthy Brittany maintains a weight between 30\u201345 pounds (14\u201320 kg), depending upon height.\n\n\n==== Types ====\nMany breeders differentiate between \"American\" Brittanys and \"French\" style dogs.  Although generally recognized as sub-sets of the same breed, there are recognizable differences between the two. The \"American Brittany\" is typically larger than the \"French Brittany\"  and a bigger running dog while the smaller French Brittany generally works more closely to the guns, but will work according to the local terrain. However, some breeders consider these \"differences\" to be unsound generalizations and that American standards should be updated to reflect the breed's standard in its country of origin, i.e. France, where black has become an acceptable coat color since 1956 while it is still considered a fault in America.\nThough it resembles a Spaniel-like dog used for flushing game, such as Springers and Cockers, Brittanys are more akin to pointers and all-purpose sporting dogs. Known in the United Kingdom as an HPR breed (Hunt, point, and retrieve), they are expected to point and retrieve all birds and ground game up to and including hare. These unique qualities have given the Brittany more Dual Champions than any other AKC Sporting Breed, a landmark reached with the 500th in 2006.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Brittany was originally bred as a hunting dog and noted for being easy to train and sweet-natured. The breed is generally more sensitive to correction than other hunters, and harsh corrections are often unnecessary.  Brittanys can become very shy if not thoroughly socialized at a young age, and even among well-socialized dogs there is significant variation in levels of friendliness.\nWhen well socialized, Brittanys are all around sound dogs, excelling  as companions, family pets, and field dogs. Eager to please and friendly, they generally learn quickly and are loyal and attached to their owners.  They are energetic and need at least an hour of vigorous exercise every day, with many needing more than this. Some animals will be over-active or hyper-sensitive, but these problems are almost invariably due to lack of exercise and training, and are not characteristics of well cared-for dogs.With more American dual champions (dogs with titles in both conformation shows and field trials) than any other breed, the Brittany maintains strong hunting instincts in all bloodlines.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nBrittanys are generally healthy and hardy dogs. The median lifespan for Brittanys in France is 12.6 years. A UK Kennel Club survey puts the breed's median lifespan at 12 years 11 months, with about 1 in 5 dogs dying of old age at an average of 14\u201315 years.  Brittanys have no undercoat and need minimal grooming or bathing. However, their floppy ears tend to trap moisture in the ear canal and should be cleaned regularly.\nDiseases found in the breed include hip dysplasia, with 14.9% of Brittanys tested between 1974 and 2009 by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals displaying the condition, and a lesser rate of 10.3% for dogs born 2003-2004. The breed is listed among those commonly affected by Canine discoid lupus erythematosus. Epilepsy is also found.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBrittany at Curlie"}, {"id": 201, "name": "French Bulldog", "country": "United Kingdom, England, France", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog201", "description": "The French Bulldog is a small breed of domestic dog. They were the result in the 1800s of a cross between bulldog ancestors imported from England and local ratters in Paris, France.In 2015, they were the fourth most popular registered dog in the United Kingdom and in the U.S. the sixth most popular AKC registered dog breed. They were rated the third most popular dog in Australia in 2017.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origin of the modern French Bulldog breed descends directly from the dogs of the Molossians, an ancient Greek tribe. The dogs were spread throughout the ancient world by Phoenician traders. British Molossian dogs were developed into the Mastiff. A sub-family of the Mastiff were the Bullenbeisser, a type of dog used for bull-baiting.Blood sports such as bull-baiting were outlawed in England in 1835, leaving these \"Bulldogs\" unemployed. However, they had been bred for non-sporting reasons since at least 1800, and so their use changed from a sporting breed to a companion breed. To reduce their size, some Bulldogs were crossed with terriers, ratter dogs from the \"slums\" of England. By 1850 the Toy Bulldog had become common in England, and appeared in conformation shows when they began around 1860. These dogs weighed around 16\u201325 pounds (7.3\u201311.3 kg), although classes were also available at dog shows for those that weighed under 12 pounds (5.4 kg).At the same time, lace workers from Nottingham, displaced by the Industrial Revolution, began to settle in Normandy, France. They brought a variety of dogs with them, including Miniature Bulldogs. The dogs became popular in France and a trade in imported small Bulldogs was created, with breeders in England sending over Bulldogs that they considered to be too small, or with faults such as ears that stood up. By 1860, there were few Miniature Bulldogs left in England, such was their popularity in France and due to the exploits of specialist dog exporters.The small Bulldog type gradually became thought of as a breed, and received a name, the Bouledogue Francais. This Francization of the English name is also a contraction of the words boule (ball) and dogue (mastiff or molosser). The dogs were highly fashionable and were sought after by society ladies and Parisian prostitutes alike, as well as creatives such as artists, writers, and fashion designers. However, records were not kept of the breed's development as it diverged further away from its original Bulldog roots. As it changed, terrier stock had been brought in to develop traits such as the breed's long straight ears.\n\n\n=== Breed clubs and modern recognition ===\nBulldogs were very popular in the past, especially in Western Europe. One of its ancestors was the English bulldog. Americans had been importing French Bulldogs for a while, but it was not until 1885 when they were brought over in order to set up an American-based breeding program. They were mostly owned by society ladies, who first displayed them at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1896. They arrived again in the following year with even more entries, where the judging of the breed would go on to have future ramifications. The judge in question at the dog show, a Mr. George Raper, only chose winners with \"rose ears\"\u2014ears that folded at the tip, as with the standard for English Bulldogs. The ladies formed the French Bull Dog Club of America and created the breed standard which stated for the first time that the \"erect bat ear\" was the correct type.In the early 20th century the breed remained in vogue for high society, with dogs changing hands for up to $3,000 and being owned by members of influential families such as the Rockefellers and the J. P. Morgans. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed quickly after the breed club was formed, and by 1906 the French Bulldog was the fifth most popular dog breed in America. In 2013, the American Kennel Club (AKC) ranked the French Bulldog as the 11th most popular breed in the United States, enjoying a sharp rise in popularity from 54th place a decade before, in 2003.  By 2014, they had moved up to become the ninth most popular AKC registered dog breed in the USA.This new Bulldog breed arrived for the first time in England in 1893, with English Bulldog breeds in uproar as the French imports did not meet the new breed standards in place by this time and wanted to prevent the English stock from cross-breeding with the French. The Kennel Club initially recognized them as a subset of the existing English Bulldog breed rather than an entirely new breed. Some English breeders in this period bred the French Bulldogs in order to resurrect the Toy Bulldog breed. On 10 July 1902, at the house of Frederick W. Cousens, a meeting was held to set up a breed club in order to seek individual recognition for the French breed. The adopted breed standard was the same one which was already in use in America, France, Germany and Austria. Despite opposition from Miniature Bulldog (the new breed name for the Toy Bulldog) and Bulldog breeders, in 1905, the Kennel Club changed its policy on the breed and recognized them separate from the English variety, initially as the Bouledogue Francais, then later in 1912 the name changed to French Bulldog.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe New Complete Dog Book: Official Breed Standards and All-New Profiles for 200 Breeds, 21st Edition, is an official publication of the American Kennel Club and sets forth the Official Breed Standard for all breeds recognized by the AKC, including the French Bulldog. The French Bulldog should have the appearance of an active, muscular dog, of heavy bone, smooth coat, compactly built, and of medium or small structure. The points should be well distributed and bear good relation one to the other, no feature being in such prominence from either excess or lack of quality that the animal appears deformed or poorly proportioned. In comparison to specimens of different gender, due allowance should be made in favor of the female dogs, which do not bear the characteristics of the breed to the same marked degree as do the male dogs.\nAcceptable colors under the breed standard are the various shades of brindle, fawn, tan or white with brindle patches (known as \"pied\"). The most common colors are brindle, then fawn, with pieds being less common than the other colors. The breed clubs do not recognize any other colors or patterns. This is because some colors come linked with genetic health problems not usually found in the breed, most notably blue coloration, which is linked with a form of alopecia (hair loss or baldness), sometimes known as \"Blue Dog Alopecia\". Although this is heavily disputed by some organizations, there does appear to be an indication that the health, hair and/or skin conditions are caused by the color pigment (melanin) clumping in the hairshaft itself. Even dogs that are not blue can develop \"blue dog alopecia\" or canine follicular dysplasia. The American Kennel Club states that Frenchies can be brindle, fawn, white, and brindle and white. The skin should be soft and loose, especially at the head and shoulders, forming wrinkles. Coat moderately fine, brilliant, short and smooth.\nThe AKC French Bulldog Standard states: Acceptable colors - All brindle, fawn, white, brindle and white, and any color except those which constitute disqualification. Unacceptable colors include: black; black and fawn; black and white; cream and white; fawn and black; fawn brindle and white; and gray and white.The head should be large and square. The top of the skull should be flat but slightly rounded. The stop should be well-defined, causing a hollow or groove between the eyes. The muzzle should be broad, deep, and well laid back; the muscles of the cheeks well developed. The nose should be extremely short; nostrils broad with well defined line between them. The nose and flews should be black, except in the case of lighter-colored dogs, where a lighter color of nose is acceptable. The flews should be thick and broad, hanging over the lower jaw at the sides, meeting the underlip in front and covering the teeth, which should not be seen when the mouth is closed. The under-jaw should be deep, square, broad, undershot, and well turned up. Eyes should be wide apart, set low down in the skull, as far from the ears as possible, round in form, of moderate size, neither sunken nor bulging, and in color dark. No haw and no white of the eye showing when looking forward. Ears shall hereafter be known as the bat ear, broad at the base, elongated, with round top, set high in the head, but not too close together, and carried erect with the orifice to the front. The leather of the ear fine and soft.\nThe neck should be thick and well arched with loose skin at the throat. The forelegs should be short, stout, straight and muscular, set wide apart. The body should be short and well-rounded. The back should be a roach back, with a slight fall close behind the shoulders. It should be strong and short, broad at the shoulders and narrowing at the loins. The chest, broad, deep and full, well ribbed with the belly tucked up.\nThe hind legs should be strong and muscular, longer than the forelegs, so as to elevate the loins above the shoulders. Hocks well let down. The feet should be moderate in size, compact and firmly set. Toes compact, well split up, with high knuckles and short stubby nails; hind feet slightly longer than forefeet. The tail should be either straight or screwed (but not curly), short, hung very low, thick root and fine tip; carried low in repose. Other than bat ears; black and white, black and tan, liver, mouse or solid black (black means without any trace of brindle) ; eyes of different color; nose other than black except in the case of the lighter-colored dogs, where a lighter color of nose is acceptable; hare lip; any mutilation.\n\nFull size French Bulldogs in different colours\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe French Bulldog, like many other companion dog breeds, requires close contact with humans. As a result, they should not be left alone for more than a few hours because these dogs experience separation anxiety if they are alone for too long. This is especially important when French Bulldogs are young, but this issue remains a concern into adulthood. Being alone for too long can cause a French Bulldog to behave in a destructive manner, which can include chewing on household items or furniture or even going to the bathroom in the house.They have fairly minimal exercise needs, but do require at least daily short walks. The French Bulldog is sometimes called \"Frog dog\" or a \"Clown dog\". \"Frog dog\" is in reference to their wide round face and the unique way they sit with hind legs spread out. \"Clown dog\" is because they are known to be fun loving vivacious \"clowns of the dog world\". Their calm nature makes them an excellent choice for apartment dwellers, as does their sensible attitude towards barking.French Bulldogs make excellent companions. The French Bulldog rarely barks, and if he does it is to draw attention, to point out that he needs something (like attention). This breed is patient and affectionate with its owners, especially with children, who are especially protected by the females. French Bulldogs can easily live with other breeds when the proper introductions are done.\nThey are ranked 109th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs. There are certain exceptions to this average level of canine intelligence; a French Bulldog named Princess Jacqueline which died in 1934 was claimed to understand 20 words, reacting correctly.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nA UK breed survey report on 71 dog deaths put the average lifespan of French Bulldogs at 8 to 10 years, while the UK breed club suggests an average of 12 to 14 years. The AKC lists that the French Bulldog breed has a lifespan of 11 to 13 years.The French bulldog has only a single short coat. which combined with their compromised breathing system, makes it impossible for them to regulate their temperature efficiently. This means the dog may easily become cold and will likely need some extra covering inside during the winter in particularly cold areas. These dogs need warm clothing when out in cold weather. Precautions must be taken when exercising during hot or humid weather, as they are prone to heat stroke. It is also recommended that French Bulldogs who live indoors have access to air conditioning to regulate their temperature. In terms of grooming, the French Bulldog requires regular nail trimming, brushing, occasional bathing, and ear cleaning. It is imperative that they be protected from temperature extremes at all times, and that they always have access to fresh water and shade. French Bulldogs are also prone to allergies, which can cause eczema on the body. Allergies can be caused by foods, insect bites, and French Bulldogs can also be frequently prone to hay fever and ophthalmic diseases.\nAs they are a brachycephalic breed, French Bulldogs are banned by several commercial airlines due to the numbers that have died while in the air. This is because dogs with snub noses find it difficult to breathe when they are hot and stressed out. The cargo space in an aircraft can rise as high as 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) when waiting on the runway. With a few precautions and special care, you can still fly with your French Bulldog.Patellar luxation is the dislocation of the patella (kneecap). In dogs, the patella is a small bone that shields the front of the stifle joint in its hind legs. This bone is held in place by ligaments. As the knee joint is moved, the patella slides in a groove in the femur. The kneecap may dislocate toward the inside (medial) or outside (lateral) of the leg. This condition may be the result of injury or congenital deformities. Patellar luxation can affect either or both legs. Testing is available to predict the presence of patellar luxation in a dog.\n\n\n=== Birth and reproduction ===\nFrench bulldogs frequently require artificial insemination, and caesarean section to give birth, with over 80% of litters delivered this way.\nMany French Bulldog stud dogs are incapable of naturally breeding. This is because French Bulldogs have very slim hips, making the male unable to mount the female to reproduce naturally. Therefore, breeders must undertake artificial insemination of female dogs. Female French bulldogs can also have erratic or 'silent' heats, which may be a side effect of thyroid disease or impaired thyroid function. French Bulldogs usually \"average\" 3 puppies per litter. Most times French Bulldog have 7-8 puppies in one litter, that is NOT the norm for American Bred French Bulldogs, although it can happen it is \"extremely rare\".\n\n\n=== Back and spine ===\nFrench Bulldogs can also be prone to an assortment of back, disk and spinal diseases and disorders, most of which are probably related to the fact that they were selectively chosen from the dwarf examples of the bulldog breed. This condition is also referred to as chondrodysplasia. French bulldogs are prone to having congenital hemivertebrae (also called \"butterfly vertebrae\"), which will show on an x-ray. More advanced technologies such as myelograms, CT scans, or MRIs are used to detect spinal cord compression. Some breeders feel that only dogs that have been x-rayed and checked for spinal anomalies should be bred.\nIn October 2010, the UK French Bulldog Health Scheme was launched. The scheme consists of three levels, the basic vet check corresponding to the Bronze level, this covers all the Kennel Club Breed Watch points of concern for the breed. The next level, Silver, requires a DNA test for hereditary cataracts, a simple cardiology test, and patella grading. The Gold level requires a hip score and a spine evaluation.  The European and UK French Bulldog fanciers and Kennel Clubs are ahead of the Americans and the AKC in moving away from the screw, cork-screw or 'tight' tail (which is an inbreed spinal defect), and returning to the short drop tail which the breed originally had. The UK breed standard now reads: \"Tail Undocked, [delete 'very'] short, set low, thick at root, tapering quickly towards tip, preferably [delete 'either'] straight, [delete 'or kinked'] and long enough to cover anus. Never curling over back nor carried gaily.\"\n\n\n=== Eyes ===\nFrench Bulldogs have a tendency towards eye issues. Cherry eye, or an everted third eyelid, has been known to occur, although it is more common in English Bulldogs and pugs. Glaucoma, retinal fold dysplasia, corneal ulcers and juvenile cataracts are also conditions which have been known to afflict French Bulldogs. Screening of prospective breeding candidates through the Canine Eye Registration Foundation (CERF) can help eliminate instances of these diseases in offspring. The skin folds under the eyes of the French bulldog should be cleaned regularly and kept dry. Tear stains are common on lighter-colored dogs.\n\n\n== Cultural legacy ==\n\n\t\t\nWhile no French Bulldogs have been Best in Show at either Crufts or the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, there was one dominant Bulldog during the 1950s at Westminster. Ch. Bouquet Nouvelle Ami won Best of Breed for eight years in a row; the run only ended with the dog's retirement after the 1960 show. The dog's owner, Amanda West, went on to win Best of Breed with other French Bulldogs for a further ten years. In 2010, a Canadian French Bulldog named Ch. Robobull Fabelhaft I'm On Fire became the first of his breed to win the Non-Sporting Group  and make it through for consideration at the Best in Show round, eventually losing to Scottish Terrier Ch. Roundtown Mercedes of Maryscot.Jason Schwartzman's French Bulldog, Arrow, made a cameo in his HBO detective comedy series Bored to Death in October 2010.The only French Bulldog aboard the Titanic went down with the ship on 15 April 1912. First class passenger, Robert Williams Daniel, a 27-year-old banker, had purchased the dog, named Gamin de Pycombe, for \u00a3150 (the equivalent of $17,000 in today's prices). A surviving passenger was later quoted as having seen a French Bulldog swimming in the ocean after the ship sank.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAging in dogs\n\n\n== References ==\nSpecific\nGeneral\n\n\n== External links ==\nFrench Bulldog at Curlie"}, {"id": 202, "name": "French Spaniel", "country": "France", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog202", "description": "The French Spaniel (Epagneul Fran\u00e7ais) is a breed of dog of the Spaniel-like setter. It was developed in France and Canada as a hunting dog, descended from dogs of the 14th century. Popular with royalty during the Middle Ages, it nearly became extinct by the turn of the 20th century but was saved by the efforts of Father Fournier, a French priest. One of the largest breeds of Spaniel, it typically has a white coat with brown markings. It is a friendly breed that has few health issues, but can be affected by a syndrome called acral mutilation and analgesia. The breed is recognised by Canadian and international kennel clubs but not by The Kennel Club (UK). The American Kennel Club has included the breed in its Foundation Stock Service, the first step to full recognition.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSpaniels were first mentioned in France during the 14th century in Gaston III of Foix-B\u00e9arn's work Livre de chasse, later translated into English as The Master of Game. They were speculated to have originated during the Crusades of the 11th century. The French Spaniel was referred to as a specific type of Spaniel by 1660 and was noted as being distinctive from the King Charles Spaniel of the Holland type.The breed was popular during the Middle Ages with it used for falconry and as a settling dog for net hunting. They became a favourite of French Royalty and Kings and Princes at the royal courts of Versailles favored them over other breeds of hunting dogs. In addition, Catherine I of Russia (1684\u20131727) was known to have owned a French Spaniel named Babe. During this period, the French Spaniel was known to have split into several regional types.The Sporting Magazine wrote of the French Spaniel and the hunting of mallards in 1805, \"The rough French Spaniel has been found the best companion on these occasions: he watches the conduct of the sportsman, and, with a velocity unequalled, darts on the wounded prey, presents it with all possible speed at the feet of his master.\" In the 1850s, the Brittany (formerly known as Brittany Spaniel) was developed from crossing French Spaniels with English Setters.James de Connick established the first breed standard for the French Spaniel in 1891. At the turn of the 20th century, the numbers of French Spaniels dropped so low that they nearly became extinct due to competition from foreign sporting dogs, in particular as French hunters chose to hunt particularly with English breeds of hunting dogs. A French priest named Father Fournier undertook the task of gathering the remaining French Spaniels in his Saint Hillaire kennels in order to preserve the breed. There he built the lineages that are representatives of those we now have. The French Spaniel Club was founded in 1921, with Father Fournier as the president of the association. The modern French Spaniel is one of a group of recognised French Spaniels, including the Brittany, Picardy and Blue Picardy.\n\n\n=== Recognition ===\n\nThe French Spaniel was little known outside France and neighboring countries until it was introduced in the Canadian province of Quebec in the 1970s. It quickly became a popular dog for hunting woodcock and grouse. The Club de l'\u00c9pagneul Fran\u00e7ais du Canada was formed in 1978 to ensure the French Spaniel would continue to meet breed standards and to pursue official recognition by the Canadian Kennel Club, by which the breed was recognised in 1985.French Spaniels are also recognized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, and the United Kennel Club. The Kennel Club (UK) and the American Kennel Club do not recognize the French Spaniel, but is recognised by the North American Versatile Hunting Dog Association, and can be registered with US dog registries in order to record their registries and compete in associated dog shows, such as the Dog Registry of America, American Canine Association, and America's Pet Registry.To qualify for recognition by the American Kennel Club, a national breed club must first be established and a written request needs to be sent to the AKC along with a breed standard. This enables qualification for the Foundation Stock Service. The next step is to qualify to compete in the Miscellaneous Class. This requires a minimum of one hundred active members in the national breed club, along with a minimum of three to four hundred dogs in the United States with a three generation pedigree (all dogs in those pedigrees must be of the same breed). In addition, they must be geographically spread across twenty states or more, and finally the clubs by-laws and constitution must be reviewed as well as breed observations made by AKC staff. There is a typical stay of between one and three years in the Miscellaneous Class before full recognition is granted. During this time, the breed club must be seen to be active and hold seminars, matches as well as local and national speciality shows. The Kennel Club (UK) does not have a miscellaneous class or foundation stock service, instead it requires British bred dog and three generation pedigrees of them, along with details from the country of origin including the breed standard. This allows listing on the Imported Breeds Register, with full recognition granted at the discretion of the Kennel Club Review Committee.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe French Spaniel is one of the two tallest spaniel breeds, being taller than the English Springer Spaniel. Males can range in height from 22\u201324 inches (56\u201361 cm), and females are about an inch shorter. Dogs can range in weight from 45\u201360 pounds (20\u201327 kg).A normal dog has a muscular appearance with a deep chest and strong legs. The French Spaniel has eyes of a dark amber colour, and a thick tail that tapers towards the tip. The hair is medium, dense, with long feathers on the ears, backs of the legs and tail. It has some waviness on the chest and otherwise lies flat on the body. The normal colour of a French Spaniel's coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light cinnamon to dark liver. Historically, the coat was only white with black markings, but the breed was mixed with other colours of Spaniels during the 19th century.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe French Spaniel has a friendly and outgoing personality and is well balanced and patient. It is not a naturally aggressive dog, is eager to please and thus can be trained easily. A dog of this breed will form a strong bond with its master, being typically a working dog. It has a high level of stamina and requires vigorous exercise.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe breed is robustly healthy with few issues and adapts well to wet weather conditions. A dermatological condition known as acral mutilation and analgesia may affect French Spaniels. It is a newly recognised disorder, with symptoms becoming apparent between three and a half months and a year of age. It was first reported in thirteen dogs in Canada and shares symptoms with the acral mutilation syndromes of the German Shorthaired Pointer, English Pointer and English Springer Spaniels. Dogs who are affected will lick, bite and mutilate their extremities resulting in ulcers with secondary bacterial infections. Self amputation of claws, digits and footpads can happen in extreme cases. The majority of the initial dogs identified were euthanised within days to months of being diagnosed.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Specific ===\n\n\n=== General ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nClub de l'Epagneul Fran\u00e7ais (France's French Spaniel Club)\nClub de l'\u00c9pagneul Fran\u00e7ais (Canada's French Spaniel Club)"}, {"id": 203, "name": "Gaddi Kutta", "country": "India", "type": "", "picture": "dog203", "description": "Gaddi Kutta is a mastiff-type mountain dog found in northern India, especially states in the western Himalayas region and in Himachal Pradesh.

The name comes from the municipality of Garaf\u00eda, in the north of the island, where the breed was most common, although specimens can be found throughout the island. The breed was officially recognized by the Real Sociedad Canina de Espa\u00f1a in 2003.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince its origins it has been linked to grazing, activity for showing special aptitude, but today it has become very important as pet.\nFor a time, this breed was on the verge of disappearing due to out-breeding with other dog breeds. Successive crosses, especially from 1960s with other breeds of shepherd dogs, demonstrated the necessity to work for its recovery and selection from the few pure specimens of the race that kept the shepherds of the island. To avoid the disappearance of the dog breed the working group to recovery of the Pastor garafiano was created, which became the Spanish association of the Pastor Garafiano Dog. Among the objectives of the association are the censuses, the creation of breeding centers, the participation in dog shows and fairs, etc.\nThe breed has been brought in samples of indigenous breeds that have been held in the Canary Islands, as well as international exhibitions held in Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas. The Department of Ethnology of the School of Veterinary of the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria has conducted several studies on the breed, which were presented at the symposium of indigenous breeds held in C\u00f3rdoba in March 1992.\nThe future of the breed looks promising due to the growing interest in these animals not only by shepherds but also people looking for a pet.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThis is a distinct canine population, it is a native to the comarca of Garaf\u00eda, on the island of La Palma, where it was used by shepherds to bring the herds of goats. Because of this, the animal thrives well in steep and rocky areas.\nIt has very heterogenous characteristics, because there has only been performed a functional selection. Its core competency is the grazing of goats and sheep in rugged terrain, by the geography of La Palma. Its origin lies the pre-Hispanic times, although the crossings with other races (most importantly the Belgian shepherds) after the conquest contributed to the development of the Pastor Garafiano.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\n\n=== Body ===\nLupoid, medium proportions or moderately rangy, well balanced, medium to large. The rump slightly higher than the cross, rather short neck and small head in relation to the body.\n\n\n=== Weight ===\nSpecimens typically weigh between 28 and 35 kg for males and between 24 and 30 kg for females. These are the weights that were given before, currently the weight is 35 to 46 kg for males and 25 to 35 kilos for females.\n\n\n=== Height ===\nThe height at the withers of males is between 57 and 64 cm, whereas in females between 55 and 62 cm. Currently, this data also changed to 60\u201370 cm for males and 55-65 for females.\n\n\n=== Head ===\nConical, relativeli small compared to the body, slightly curved front, which highlights for the somewhat back implantation and separated from the ears, that may be split or prone split to forward. May also appear erect, observing then a tendency to keep them folded to any stimulus, showing its inner face.\nThe nose is always black. Eyes are oblique, almond shaped and brown. Short collected lips. Pincer bite. Stop soft and very pronounced.\n\n\n=== Legs ===\nThe legs are strong, well-positioned, highlighting further for its proportions. Sometimes its have spurs, which are often double and some implanted.\n\n\n=== Hair ===\n\nThe coat is tawny or alobada. Puppies are born brown, color changing as adults, appearing in some cases white hairs or spots on the chest, toes or tail tip, usually disappearing to grow.\nThe hair is abundant and more or less long. Sometimes it is soft while in other cases it is rough. It accumulates at the base of the ears, neck, tails, tail and the edges of the legs. The tail is usually crowded with hair, taking sabre shape being slightly curled, but never on the back.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe character of Pastor Garafiano is docile and friendly. When it meets strangers shows a typical attitude: barking, folding ears, tail movements and turns in the head showing the corner of its mouth in a smile.

For the type of cattle, see Gascon cattle. For type of language see Gascon language\n\nThe Gascon Saintongeois (FCI No.21) is a breed of dog of the scenthound type, recognised in two sizes, Grand (large) and Petit (smaller than the Grand, but not a small dog.) Originating in France, the breed is used for hunting in packs and descends from the old Hound of Saintonge type of large hunting dog.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe breed is a very typical French hound, with a lean and muscular body, long legs, long drop ears and pendulous flews (lips). Size for the Grand is 65 to 72 cm (25.6 to 28.3 ins) at the withers, females at total 24 to 26 inches; size for the Petit is 56 to 62 cm (22 to 24.4 ins) at the withers, making it still a fairly large dog; females are slightly smaller. Grands weigh 66 to 71 pounds.\nThe eyes are dark chestnut. It has an elongated head. Its black nose is well-developed, and the lips are pendent. It has a deep chest, and a strong back. The tail is elegant and saber.\n\nThe colour of the coat is white with black patches, sometimes speckled or ticked with black. Ears and face around the eyes are black and the cheeks are tan, but there should not be a tricolour appearance. Two tan markings are above the eyes, and sometimes a tan marking is found on the base of the upper thigh, which is called the \"roe buck mark\". Faults, which indicate the dog should not be bred, include lack of substance, weak back, deviated tail, cow hocked, or legs that are too angulated or straight, which would impede running ability, as well as being off-colour or overly aggressive or overly shy.The breed is noted for its good nose, excellent voice, and beautiful gallop, important attributes in a hunting dog. It is instinctively a pack dog.It is audacious, resistant, aristocratic, and is very affectionate off the hunting fields.\n\n\n== History and use ==\nOnly three old Saintongeois hounds survived the French Revolution, two dogs and a bitch. Count Joseph de Carayon-Latour in the mid-19th century crossed the last of the old Hound of Saintonge with a few of the remaining old type Bleu de Gascogne. The hounds that were white with black ticking were retained and later given the name Gascon-Saintongeois.In the middle of the 20th century, hunters in the south west of France selected smaller dogs from litters of Grand Gascon Saintongeois for hunting hare and other small game. These became the Petit Gascon Saintongeois.The Grand Gascon Saintongeois is used for hunting big game including wild boar, roe deer and sometimes gray wolf, usually in a pack. The Petit Gascon Saintongeois is a versatile hunter, usually used on hare and rabbit, but it can also be used for big game.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnglo French Hounds\nDog terminology\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSearch The Open Directory Project (DMOZ) links for clubs and information about the Gascon Saintongeois\nPetit Gascon Saintongeois in Northern Italy\nGascon Saintongeois in France"}, {"id": 208, "name": "Georgian Shepherd Dog", "country": "Georgia (country)", "type": "", "picture": "dog208", "description": "The Georgian Shepherd (Georgian: \u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10e3\u10da\u10d8 \u10db\u10d7\u10d8\u10e1 \u10eb\u10d0\u10e6\u10da\u10d8) also known as Georgian Mountain Dog is a molosser-type livestock guardian breed of dog with ancient working origins in the Georgia Caucasus.There are two kinds of Georgian mountain dog: the short haired \"Lion\" type, typically pure white or white with dark patches on its coat and the long hair \"Bear\" type are typically dark brown to black head and lighter brown covering the rest of the coat.\nIn Georgia they are known as, Qartuli Nagazi. The short hair \"Lion\" type is considered to the oldest or Aboriginal variant of the breed, with the pure white being the rarest coat color.  The \"Lion\" variant was predominately found in the north-east regions of Georgia;  Kazbegi, Khevsureti, and Tusheti, but is also found in the adjacent mountainous border areas of Russia and Azerbaijan.\n\n\n== Description ==\nBecause of their morphology and lineage, Georgian shepherds fall into the Molosser category. Male Georgian mountain dogs should be at least 65 centimetres (26 in) in height at the withers; females should be at least 60 centimetres (24 in) in height. Physically, these dogs are strongly-boned, muscular, and athletic, with a large head and powerful legs. Georgian mountain dogs tend to be assertive, brave, and alert. Shepherds traditionally used Georgian mountain dogs for defending sheep from predators.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Cynological Federation of Georgia has had a strict battle with the Russian federation of Cynologs about Caucasian Shepherd dog.In 2012, the International Cynological Federation was to have decided which national breed would be the Caucasian Shepherd Dog as a result of this heated discussion.After the removal of most of the Qartuli Nagazi from Georgia, Georgian enthusiasts with support from the Ministry of Environment began expeditions to the regions of Georgia to describe and take photos of the remaining Georgian shepherds. Georgia started advertising the breed using television broadcasting and printing articles about Georgian shepherds in order to popularize the breed.Following the Soviet collapse, Georgia began to popularise this dog. Today, the goal is to breed another rare Georgian shepherd, Georgia's ancient white shepherd. Unfortunately, Georgian shepherds are still used in dog fighting.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArmenian Gampr dog\nCaucasian Shepherd Dog\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External Links ==\nCynological Federation of Georgia - Breed Standard(in Georgian)\nCynological Federation of Georgia - Breed Standard(in English)"}, {"id": 209, "name": "German Longhaired Pointer", "country": "Germany", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog209", "description": "The German longhaired pointer (GLP) is a breed of dog. Developed in Germany, it is used as a multipurpose gundog. It is closely related to its cousins, the German Shorthaired Pointer (GSP), the German Wirehaired Pointer (GWP) and the Large M\u00fcnsterl\u00e4nder, which was previously part of the breed.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe GLP should be muscular, elegant, and athletic. It should not be bulky or cumbersome, and it should be able to move with great speed and freedom. It has moderate bone, but has substance, and must never look frail or weak.  Like all German pointers, they have webbed feet. Puppies in their early years must be monitored for aggression.\n\n\n==== Coat and color ====\nThe coat is medium length, about 3 to 5 cm (1.2 to 2.0 in) long on the body, with the feathering somewhat longer. The coat is slightly wavy, but must not be curly. It is not silky or soft, but rather firm and shiny. It always has a double coat, with the undercoat being quite dense, but not so profuse as to make the guard hairs stand out from the body. The color is solid brown with white permitted on the chest, paws, and down the top of the muzzle, or dark brown roan, with large patches of solid brown, especially on the head, ears, back, and base of the tail.\n\n\n==== Size ====\nThe GLP is between 60\u201370 cm (24\u201328 in) at the withers for males, and 58\u201366 cm (23\u201326 in) for females. It weighs approximately 30 kilograms (66 lb).\n\n\n==== Gait ====\nThe strides should be long and free, with strong drive from the hindquarters, and good reach from the front.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nGLPs are a kind, gentle, friendly, and intelligent breed. They are very affectionate, and may experience separation anxiety. They only make good pets when properly exercised, as they need a \"job\" to do, and do not adapt well to a sedentary life. The GLP is an excellent family pet, as it enjoys playing with children. It is very sociable with dogs.\n\n\n== Care ==\nThe GLP is very trainable, and loves to work. Because of this, it needs large amounts of exercise daily, needing more than most pet owners can give. It is not well suited for urban life, as it thrives on having lots of room to run and swim. Its ideal setting would be in a rural area, with an active owner who hunts with the dog on a regular basis. GLPs need a moderate amount of grooming about once or twice a week. They are highly intelligent, very trainable, and athletic, traits which make them suitable for many dog sports, especially field trials, obedience, and agility.\n\n\n== Health ==\nBecause they are quite rare in most parts of the world, GLPs are unprofitable to irresponsible breeders such as puppy mills and backyard breeders, and do not have any genetic disorders prevalent in the breed. Their ears are mildly prone to infection, a problem which is easily avoided by cleaning the dog's ears on a regular basis, as well as after swimming.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe GLP was developed in Germany for use as a pointer. It was originally a rather slow dog, and was crossed with setters and English Pointers in the 19th century to improve speed. It was very stubborn and temperamental, and has since been bred for a steady, friendly temperament. It was first shown in 1878 in Frankfurt, at which time the first breed standard was written. Breeders then began to focus their efforts on producing dogs that performed equally well in the field and the show ring, an endeavour continued by breeders today.Function became preferred over form.  As Karl Brandt, an early expert and theorist on this breed and its precursors, wrote in the llustrierten Jagdzeitung (1883) that: \"At field competitions (trials), which should be part of breeding programs, the dogs will hopefully prove that they have not lost their natural hunting ability during the years when only looks dictated breeding\" (i.e, pre 1878.)  five genealogical sires, constituting separate but parallel lines, are within the Longhair breed.Like most of the longhaired pointing breeds, the breed is descended from the point spaniel. One of the oldest of the \"versatile breeds,\" it is but one of a few that disallow black as a color.  The Large Munsterlander was developed from the GLP after it was decided that GLPs must only be brown-and-white (there were thoughts that coloration also involved some undesirable characteristics), the black-and-white strain became the ancestors of the Large Munsterlander.This breed now is a multipurpose field dog that combines: pointer, retriever (including water work), setter and tracker (of wounded game).Breeding lines have been recorded in the Foundation Stock Service since May 2010; and effective July 1, 2011 the breed is approved to compete in AKC Performance Events.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGerman shorthaired pointer\nGerman wirehaired pointer\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKoshyk, Craig (2011).

The breed is included in the origins of the Dobermann, the Rottweiler, the Miniature Pinscher, the Affenpinscher, the Standard Schnauzer (and, by extension, the Miniature Schnauzer and Giant Schnauzer). The breed is rising in numbers in the U.S., mainly due to their full acceptance to AKC in 2003. In Australia, the breed is established with a rise in popularity becoming evident.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe German Pinscher is a medium-sized dog, usually weighing between 25\u201345 pounds (11\u201320 kilograms) and typically 17\u201320 inches (43\u201351 centimetres) in height, with a short coat. Colors for this breed include black and rust, red, fawn, blue and tan.  The ideal German Pinscher is elegant in appearance with a strong square build and moderate body structure, muscular and powerful endurance and agility. For all countries where the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale standard applies, only black and rust and solid red are allowed colors. Colors that became extinct during the world wars of the twentieth century include solid black, salt-and-pepper, and harlequin.\nGerman Pinschers previously had their tails docked and ears cropped in countries where the procedures are legal. Historically, tail docking was thought to prevent rabies, strengthen the back, increase the animal's speed, and prevent injuries when working. Ears also were cropped, as they were thought to prevent injuries while working and increase the intense appearance of the canine. Today, these are done mainly for cosmetic reasons, although most countries are moving away from the procedure that has been found to be unnecessary for most dogs in their new life as pets and activity partners.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Wire Haired and Smooth Haired Pinschers, as the Standard Schnauzer and German Pinscher were originally called, were shown in dog books as early as 1884. However drawings of the German Pinscher date back to at least 1780, and the breed likely traces its roots to varieties of ratters well established on farms in Germany as far back as the 15th century. These medium-sized dogs descended from early European herding and guardian breeds.\nThe source of the German Pinscher can be traced back to 1836 when this breed surpassed the Mops in popularity. Pinschers were used as guardians for coaches. They also lived in homesteads where they were used to kill vermin, a job they did by instinct, as such behavior did not need to be trained into the breed. Even today you can observe German Pinschers searching for and finding rats in open areas and in homes. This high prey drive is a good reason not to leave a German Pinscher off lead outside of a fenced area.The Standard Schnauzer (then referred to as the Wire Haired Pinscher) was originally born in the same litter as the German Pincher. Over time, breeders decided to separate the \"varieties,\" changing them to actual \"breeds\". After three generations of the same coat were born, the Pinscher-Schnauzer club allowed them to be registered as their respective \"breed\".\nFrom 1950 to 1958, no litter had been registered. Credit is attributed to Werner Jung for collecting several of the breed in 1958 to continue the German Pinscher as we know the breed today.\nThe German Pinscher came to breeders in the United States in the early 1980s, though accounts of singular German Pinschers appearing in the country before then have been noted. In 1985, the German Pinscher Club of America was started by various German Pinscher fanciers, most of whom are no longer active in the breed. At this time, the German Pinscher was shown in rare breed shows. They were also recognized by the United Kennel Club. The German Pinscher gained full acceptance by the Canadian Kennel Club in 2000.\nIn 2004, the German Pinscher competed at its first Westminster Kennel Club. The Best of Breed winner was Ch. Windamir Hunter des Charmettes with the Best of Opposite Sex to Best of Breed won by Ch. Windamir's Chosen One.\n\n\n=== Extinct varieties ===\nThere are several now-extinct varieties of the German Pinscher:\nSchweizer Pinscher (also called the Jonataler Pinscher, Pfisterlinge, Silberpinsch, Swiss Salt and Pepper Pinscher, Swiss Shorthair Pinscher)\nSeidenpinscher (also called the German Silky Pinscher, Silky Pinscher)Some of these may have recently been re-formed from the German Pinscher and marketed as rare breeds for those seeking unique pets.\n\n\n== Health and temperament ==\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nA German Pinscher should be an alert, good natured and playful dog. They are known for being very loyal, watchful and fearless. A well-bred German Pinscher will be a loving companion with an even temperament.  When considering adding a German Pinscher to a family, it is advised to be able to meet and touch the mother of the puppy you are offered.\nGerman Pinschers are very energetic working dogs, in many cases requiring several hours of exercise a day. Accordingly, a large, securely fenced yard is highly recommended for anyone considering the breed as a pet and the owner to be mindful of training them appropriately. Socialization from puppyhood is a must, as high prey drive is common in the breed so in a city environment they need to learn to control their impulses. This does, however, make them a great fetch companion.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nDue to the small gene pool of the German Pinscher, breeders should health test their dogs for hereditary cataracts, hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia, von Willebrand disease, thyroid disorder, and with the increased incidences of cardiac disease due to irresponsible breeding practices, German Pinschers suspect for heart issues should be removed from all breeding programs.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nGerman Pinscher at Curlie"}, {"id": 211, "name": "Stichelhaar", "country": "Germany", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog211", "description": "The German Roughhaired Pointer (Deutsch Stichelhaar) is a versatile hunting dog that originated in Frankfurt, Germany.

Simon & Schuster's Guide to: Dogs, Simon & Schuster Inc."}, {"id": 212, "name": "German Shepherd", "country": "Germany", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog212", "description": "The German Shepherd (German: Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund, German pronunciation: [\u02c8\u0283\u025b\u02d0f\u0250\u02cch\u028ant]) is a breed of medium to large-sized working dog that originated in Germany. In the English language, the  breed's officially recognized name is German Shepherd Dog (sometimes abbreviated as GSD). The breed was officially known as the  Alsatian in Britain until 1977 when its name was changed back to German Shepherd. The German Shepherd is a relatively new breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899. As part of the Herding Group, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep. Since that time however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles, and acting. The German Shepherd is the second-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club and seventh-most registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Description ==\nGerman Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs. The breed standard height at the withers is 60\u201365 cm (24\u201326 in) for males, and 55\u201360 cm (22\u201324 in) for females. German Shepherds are longer than tall, with an ideal proportion of 10 to 8 1/2. The AKC official breed standard does not set a standard weight range. They have a domed forehead, a long square-cut muzzle with strong jaws and a black nose. The eyes are medium-sized and brown. The ears are large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement. A German Shepherd has a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace. The tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.German Shepherds have a two-layer coat which is close and dense with a thick undercoat. The coat is accepted in two variants; medium and long. The long-hair gene is recessive, making the long-hair variety rarer. Treatment of the long-hair variation differs across standards; they are accepted but not competed with standard coated dogs under the German and UK Kennel Clubs while they can compete with standard coated dogs, but are considered a fault in the American Kennel Club. The FCI accepted the long-haired type in 2010, listing it as the variety b\u2014while short-haired type is listed as the variety a.Most commonly, German Shepherds are either tan/black or red/black. Most colour varieties have black masks and black body markings which can range from a classic \"saddle\" to an over-all \"blanket.\" Rarer colour variations include the sable, pure-black, pure-white, liver, silver and blue varieties. The all-black and sable varieties are acceptable according to most standards; however, the blue and liver are considered to be serious faults and the all-white is grounds for instant disqualification from showing in conformation at All Breed and Specialty Shows.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Intelligence ===\nGerman Shepherds were bred specifically for their intelligence, a trait for which they are now famous. In the book The Intelligence of Dogs, author Stanley Coren ranked the breed third for intelligence, behind Border Collies and Poodles. He found that they had the ability to learn simple tasks after only five repetitions and obeyed the first command given 95% of the time. Coupled with their strength, this trait makes the breed desirable as police, guard and search and rescue dogs, as they are able to quickly learn various tasks and interpret instructions better than other breeds.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nGerman Shepherds are moderately active dogs and are described in breed standards as self-assured. The breed is marked by a willingness to learn and an eagerness to have a purpose. They are curious, which makes them excellent guard dogs and suitable for search missions. They can become over-protective of their family and territory, especially if not socialized correctly. They are not inclined to become immediate friends with strangers. German Shepherds are highly intelligent and obedient, as well as being protective of their owners.\n\n\n=== Aggression and biting ===\nWhile an Australian report from 1999 provides statistics showing that German Shepherds are the breed third most likely to attack a person in some Australian locales, once their popularity is taken into account, the percentages of GSD attacks drops to 38th.According to the National Geographic Channel television show Dangerous Encounters, the bite of a German Shepherd has a force of over 1,060 newtons (238 lbf) (compared with that of a Rottweiler, over 1,180\u20131,460 newtons (265\u2013328 lbf), a Pit bull, 1,050 newtons (235 lbf), a Labrador Retriever, of approximately 1,000 newtons (230 lbf), or a human, of approximately 380 newtons (86 lbf)).\n\n\n== Modern breed ==\n\nThe modern German Shepherd breed is criticized by some for straying away from Max von Stephanitz's original ideology that German Shepherds should be bred primarily as working dogs and that breeding should be strictly controlled to eliminate defects quickly. He believed that, above all else, German Shepherds should be bred for intelligence and working ability.\n\n\n=== Controversy ===\nThe Kennel Club, in the United Kingdom, is involved in a dispute with German Shepherd breed clubs about the issue of soundness in the show-strain of the breed. The show-strains have been bred with an extremely sloping topline (back) that causes poor gait in the hind legs. Working-pedigree lines, such as those in common use as service dogs, generally retain the traditional straight back of the breed.\nThe debate was catalyzed when the issue was raised in the BBC documentary, Pedigree Dogs Exposed, which said that critics of the breed describe it as \"half dog, half frog\". An orthopedic vet remarked on footage of dogs in a show ring that they were \"not normal\".\nThe Kennel Club's position is that \"this issue of soundness is not a simple difference of opinion, it is the fundamental issue of the breed's essential conformation and movement.\" The Kennel Club has decided to retrain judges to penalize dogs suffering these problems.The Kennel Club also recommends testing for haemophilia and hip dysplasia, other common problems with the breed.\n\n\n== Use as a working dog ==\nGerman Shepherds are a popular selection for use as working dogs. They are known for being easy to train and good for performing tasks and following instructions. They are especially well known for their police work, being used for tracking criminals, patrolling troubled areas and detection and holding of suspects. Additionally thousands of German Shepherds have been used by the military. Usually trained for scout duty, they are used to warn soldiers to the presence of enemies or of booby traps or other hazards. German Shepherds have also been trained by military groups to parachute from aircraft or as anti-tank weapons. They were used in World War II as messenger dogs, rescue dogs and personal guard dogs. A number of these dogs were taken home by foreign servicemen, who were impressed by their intelligence.The German Shepherd is one of the most widely used breeds in a wide variety of scent-work roles. These include search and rescue, cadaver searching, narcotics detection, explosives detection, accelerant detection and mine detection dog, among others. They are suited for these lines of work because of their keen sense of smell and their ability to work regardless of distractions.\nAt one time the German Shepherd was the breed chosen almost exclusively to be used as a guide dog for the visually impaired. When formal guide dog training began in Switzerland in the 1920s under the leadership of Dorothy Eustis, all of the dogs trained were German Shepherd females. An experiment in temperament testing of a group of Labrador Retrievers and German Shepherds showed that the Retrievers scored higher on average in emotional stability and ability to recover promptly from frightening situations, cooperative behavior and friendliness; while the German Shepherds were superior in aggression and defensive behavior. These results suggested that Labrador Retrievers were more suited to guide dog work while German Shepherds were more suited to police work.\nCurrently, Labradors and Golden Retrievers are more widely used for this work, although there are still German Shepherds being trained. In 2013, about 15% of the dogs trained by Guide Dogs of America are German Shepherds, while the remainder are Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers. The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association in the United Kingdom states that crosses between Golden Retrievers and Labrador Retrievers make the best guide dogs, although they also train some German Shepherds, as well as some other breeds. Guide Dogs for the Blind in the United States trains only Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers and crosses between these breeds. Guide Dogs Queensland in Australia also trains only Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers.German Shepherds are still used for herding and tending sheep grazing in meadows next to gardens and crop fields. They are expected to patrol the boundaries to keep sheep from trespassing and damaging the crops. In Germany and other places these skills are tested in utility dog trials also known as HGH (Herdengebrauchshund) herding utility dog trials.One Mexican German Shepherd, Zuyaqui, was dissected and his body put on display at the Sedena's \"Narco Museum\" in Mexico. He is regarded to be the dog who has captured the most drugs in Mexican police and military history.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2018, a genetic study found that just prior to 1859 a broadly distributed European herding dog had given rise to the German Shepherd, the French Berger Picard, and the five Italian herding breeds: Bergamasco Shepherd, Cane Paratore, Lupino del Gigante, Pastore d'Oropa, and the it:Cane da pastore della Lessinia e del Lagorai.In the 1800s northwest Europe (Belgium, Germany, Netherlands) the most common dog used to herd sheep and protect the homes was the so-called \"continental shepherd dog\". These dogs all looked very similar at that time, and it was around 1890 that the three breeds (Belgian Shepherd, German Shepherd and Dutch Shepherd) went their separate ways. Of those breeds, the Dutch shepherd looks closest to the continental shepherd of that time.\n\nDuring the 1850s, attempts were being made to standardize dog breeds. Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators. In Germany this was practiced within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognized that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell. The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.To combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany. The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote; some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance. While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.\nWith the rise of large, industrialized cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary. At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise. Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working. He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.In 1899, Von Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein. Hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what Von Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty and beauty, that he purchased him immediately. After purchasing the dog he changed his name to Horand von Grafrath and Von Stephanitz founded the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde (Society for the German Shepherd Dog). Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog and was the first dog added to the society's breed register.Horand became the centre-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia and Wurttemberg. Fathering many pups, Horand's most successful was Hektor von Schwaben. Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf and Pilot, who later fathered a total of eighty-four pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring. This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed. In the original German Shepherd studbook, Zuchtbuch f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde (SZ), within the two pages of entries from SZ No. 41 to SZ No. 76, there are four Wolf Crosses. Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German Shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to Von Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe breed was named Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund by von Stephanitz, literally translating to \"German Shepherd Dog\". The breed was so named due to its original purpose of assisting shepherds in herding and protecting sheep. At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as Altdeutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde, or Old German Shepherd Dogs.\nThe direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the official breed registry; however, at the conclusion of World War I, it was believed that the inclusion of the word \"German\" would harm the breed's popularity, due to the anti-German sentiment of the era. The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to \"Alsatian Wolf Dog\", after the French region of Alsace bordering Germany. This name was also adopted by many other international kennel clubs.\nEventually, the appendage \"wolf dog\" was dropped, after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the breed's popularity and legality. The name Alsatian remained for five decades, until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds. The word \"Alsatian\" still appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name and was only removed in 2010.\n\n\n== Popularity ==\n\nWhen the UK Kennel accepted registrations in 1919, 54 German Shepherds were registered. By 1926 this number had grown to over 8,000. The breed gained international recognition after the end of World War I. Returning soldiers spoke highly of the breed and animal actors Rin Tin Tin and Strongheart popularised the breed further. The first German Shepherd Dog registered in the United States was Queen of Switzerland. Her offspring suffered from defects as the result of poor breeding, which caused the breed to suffer a decline in popularity during the late 1920s.Popularity increased again after the German Shepherd Sieger Pfeffer von Bern became the 1937 and 1938 Grand Victor in American Kennel club dog shows, only to suffer another decline at the conclusion of World War II, due to anti-German sentiment. Popularity increased gradually until 1993, when they became the third most popular breed in the United States. As of  2016, the German Shepherd is the second most popular breed in the US. Additionally, the breed is typically among the most popular in other registries. The German Shepherd Dog's physique is very well suited to competing in shows and competitions, such as agility trials.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nMany common ailments of the German Shepherd are a result of the inbreeding practiced early in the breed's life. One such common ailment is hip and elbow dysplasia which may cause the dog to experience pain later on in life and may cause arthritis. A study conducted by the University of Zurich  found that 45% of the police working dogs were affected by degenerative spinal stenosis, although a small sample size was used. The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals found that 19.1% of German Shepherd are affected by hip dysplasia. There are however ways to help prevent hip dysplasia. They include making sure you get them from a good breeder, keeping them on a healthy diet, and limiting the amount of jumping or rough play. Due to the large and open nature of their ears, German Shepherds are not prone to ear infections because there is no hair in the outer ear canal to hold debris or moisture. According to a recent survey in the UK, the median life span of German Shepherds is 10.95 years, which is normal for a dog of their size.\nDegenerative myelopathy, a neurological disease, occurs with enough regularity specifically in the breed to suggest that the breed is predisposed to it. A very inexpensive DNA saliva test is now available to screen for degenerative myelopathy. The test screens for the mutated gene that has been seen in dogs with degenerative myelopathy. A small study in the UK showed 16% of young asymptomatic GSDs to be homozygous for the mutation, with a further 38% being carriers. Now that a test is available the disease can be bred out of breeds with a high preponderance. The test is only recommended for predisposed breeds, but can be performed on DNA samples from any dog, collected through swabbing the inside of the animal's cheek with a sterile cotton swab. Prospective German Shepherd buyers can now request the test from the breeder or buy from a breeder that is known to test their dogs.Additionally, German Shepherds have a higher than normal incidence of Von Willebrand disease, a common inherited bleeding disorder, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), a degenerative disease of the pancreas. It is estimated that 1% of the UK GSD population suffers from this disease. Treatment is usually in the form of pancreatic supplements taken with food.\n\n\n=== Skeletal health and supplementation ===\nMusculoskeletal disorders are debilitating conditions that are often associated with genetic makeup, malnutrition, and stress-related events. Some breeds like the German shepherd, are predisposed to a variety of different skeletal disorders, including but not limited to: canine hip dysplasia, Cauda equina syndrome, and osteoarthritis. These conditions can be a result of poor breeding or induced by intense exercise and poor diet.\nCanine hip dysplasia (CHD) is an orthopedic condition resulting from abnormal development of the hip joint and surrounding tissue causing the instability and partial dislocation of the hip joint, resulting in pain, inflammation, lameness, and potentially osteoarthritis of the joint. German shepherds are genetically predisposed to CHD and the University of Veterinary Medicine in Germany found its prevalence estimated to be approximately 35% of veterinary cases associated with the disorder.Osteoarthritis is one of the main contributors of musculoskeletal pain and disabilities that commonly affect German shepherds. Mechanical stress, oxidative damage and inflammatory mediators combine to induce the gradual degeneration of the articular cartilage in the joint, resulting in reduced muscle mass, pain, and locomotion.It is essential to feed a well-balanced diet designed for large breeds like the German shepherd, to ensure adequate growth rates and proper maintenance of musculoskeletal health. Dietary energy levels should be monitored and controlled throughout all life stages and activity levels of the German shepherd to assist in the prevention and treatment of musculoskeletal disorder symptoms. Several dietary factors play a crucial role in maintaining skeletal health and are described as follows.\nAppropriate calcium levels are vital in developing a strong skeletal system and aid in preventing orthopaedic diseases like Canine Hip Dysplasia. Furthermore, the ratio of calcium and phosphorus must be balanced and at a recommended ratio of 1.2:1 to ensure proper bone development and structure. Imbalances in calcium and phosphorus levels can result in various skeletal complications. Excess phosphorus can produce lesions in bones whereas excessive calcium can lead to hypocalcaemia and result in excess bone deposition, interfering with normal bone development. In extreme circumstances of insufficient calcium intake, bone resorption can occur due to the body withdrawing calcium deposits from the skeletal frame as a last resort to fulfill dietary needs.Omega-3 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been shown to be highly effective in the prevention of cartilage catabolism in in vitro models, suggesting that its supplementation in food could aid in decreasing the symptoms of osteoarthritis in German shepherds. Furthermore, EPA and DHA inhibit key regulators of the inflammatory process and suppress their activation which can help alleviate pain and reduce inflamed joints associated with many skeletal disorders. Ensuring an appropriate ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids of approximately 5:1 is very important for inflammation processes. Animals source, specifically marine life such as fish, krill, and mussels, and plant sources such as flaxseed, soybean and canola oil, are particularly rich in omega-3 fatty acids.Glucosamine is an amino-monosaccharide that naturally occurs in all tissues, particularly in articular cartilage of joints and from the biosynthesis of glucose. Natural synthesis of glucosamine occurs in the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage in joints. However, as a result of damage to the joint or cartilage, there is decreased ability to synthesize glucosamine resulting in the deterioration of the joint, and supplementation is required. Clinical trials of long term administration of glucosamine in German Shepherds have reduced symptoms of degenerative joint disease and accelerated cartilage healing. Anti-inflammatory effects of glucosamine are believed to contribute to the reduction of pain, promote joint recovery and mobility, and prevent further cartilage degradation. Similarly, chondroitin supplementation is proposed to have comparable results in inhibiting degradative enzymes within the cartilage matrix to reduce the effects of osteoarthritis, but further research is required to assess long term benefits.Vitamins such as A and D also have crucial roles in bone development and maintenance by regulating bone and calcium metabolism. Adequate levels should be incorporated into a German shepherd diet to promote a healthy musculoskeletal system.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nGerman Shepherds have been featured in a wide range of media. \nIn 1921 Strongheart became one of the earliest canine film stars, and was followed in 1922 by Rin Tin Tin, who is considered the most famous German Shepherd. Both have stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. German Shepherds were used in the popular Canadian series The Littlest Hobo.\nBatman's dog Ace the Bat-Hound appeared in the Batman comic books, initially in 1955, through 1964. Between 1964 and 2007, his appearances were sporadic.\nIn the 1957 film Old Yeller, the rabid Great Plains wolf who infects the titular character isn't played by a wolf, but by a male German Shepherd.\nDuring the montage of hilarious dog clips in the YouTube video \"America's Funniest Home Videos Part 100\" in which \"(Feelin' Like a) Big Dog\" by Akon is heard, a clip is shown of a fat, thuggish man abusing two small boys until the boys' German Shepherd comes and bites the thuggish man's groin. \nA German Shepherd named Inspector Rex is the star of an Austrian Police procedural drama program of the same name, which won many awards, where German Shepherd Rex assists the Vienna Kriminalpolizei homicide unit. The show was aired in many languages.At the beginning of the 2007 film Alvin and the Chipmunks, when the titular characters are wandering around in the crowded lobby of JETT Records, they are confronted by a blind man's German Shepherd guide dog.\nIn the 2017 film A Dog's Purpose, a dog (voiced by Josh Gad), who was previously a retriever named Bailey, is reincarnated as a female German Shepherd police dog named Ellie.\n\n\n== Notable German Sheperds ==\n\n\n=== Dickin Medal recipients ===\nAwarded the Dickin Medal for conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving in military conflict\n\nJet\nIrma\nThorn\nRifleman Khan\nRex\nBing\nAntis\nAppollo\nSam\nLucky\n\n\n=== PDSA Gold medal recipients ===\nAwarded the PDSA Gold Medal for animal bravery\n\nBlue,\nAjax\nGage\n\n\n=== PDSA Certificate recipients ===\nAwarded the PDSA Certificate for Animal Bravery or Devotion\n\nWicker\n\n\n== See also ==\nCzechoslovakian Vlcak\u2014A breed recognized by the FCI, originating by a crossing of 48 German Shepherd Dogs and four Carpathian wolves\nKing Shepherd\u2014A breed not recognized by any major kennel club, originating from German Shepherd Dogs\nShiloh Shepherd\u2014A breed not recognized by any major kennel club, originating from German Shepherd Dogs\nWhite Swiss Shepherd Dog (Berger Blanc Suisse)\u2014A breed recognised by the FCI, originating from white-coated German Shepherd Dogs\nEast-European Shepherd\u2014A breed based on German Shepherd, specially developed in USSR for military, guarding or guiding.

Dogs 101. Animal Planet.\nGerman Shepherd at Curlie"}, {"id": 213, "name": "German Shorthaired Pointer", "country": "Germany", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog213", "description": "The German Shorthaired Pointer (GSP) is a medium to large sized breed of dog developed in the 19th century in Germany for hunting.\nA versatile hunting breed, being an all-purpose gun breed of dog suitable for both land and water, it is streamlined yet powerful with strong legs that make it able to move rapidly and turn quickly. It has moderately long floppy ears set high on the head. Its muzzle is long, broad, and strong, allowing it to retrieve even heavy game. The dog's profile should be straight or strongly Roman nosed; any dished appearance to the profile is incorrect. The eyes are generally brown, with darker eyes being desirable; yellow or \"bird of prey\" eyes are a fault. The tail is commonly docked, although this is now prohibited in some countries. In the current breed standard the tail is docked at approximately 40% of its length before it curves. In competition the dog is penalized if the tail is curved either up or down while the dog is moving.  When the GSP is in classic point stance, the tail should be held straight out from the body, forming a line with the pointing head and body. Like all German pointers, GSPs have webbed feet. They are known for going after water fowl in the water.\nThe German Shorthaired Pointer is a member of the Sporting Group.\n\n\n== Coat and color ==\n\nThe German Shorthaired Pointer's coat is short and flat with a dense undercoat protected by stiff guard hairs making the coat water resistant and allowing the dog to stay warm in cold weather. This allows the German Shorthaired Pointer to be an agile hunter with high performance in both field and water. The color can be a dark brown with some lighter brown colors, referred to as \"liver\" (incorrectly as \"chocolate\" or \"chestnut\"), black (although any area of black is cause for disqualification in American Kennel Club-sanctioned shows), black roan, white, liver roan, liver and white, or black and white. The American Kennel Club recognizes only a solid liver or liver and white coat. Commonly, the head is a solid or nearly solid color, and the body is speckled or \"ticked\" with liver and white, sometimes with large patches of solid color called \"saddles.\" Roan coats are also common, with or without patching. Solid liver and solid black coats also occur, often with a small blaze of ticking or white on the chest. While the German standard permits a slight sandy colouring (\"Gelber Brand\") at the extremities, this colouring is rare, and a dog displaying any yellow colouring is disqualified in AKC and CKC shows. The colouring of the GSP provides camouflage in the winter seasons. The coat can be very glossy if washed.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe temperament of dogs can be affected by different factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. The German Shorthaired Pointer was developed to be a dog suited for family life, as well as a versatile hunter. Therefore its temperament is that of an intelligent, bold, boisterous, eccentric, and characteristically affectionate dog that is cooperative and easily trained. This breed is smart, friendly, willing, and enthusiastic. The GSP is usually good with children, although care should be taken because the breed can be boisterous especially when young. These dogs love interaction with humans and are suitable pets for active families who will give them an outlet for their considerable energy; they must be avidly run multiple times a week. The breed should be socialized, which includes exposure to different people, sights, sounds, and experiences when they are young. This early socializing will help to ensure that your German Shorthaired Pointer puppy will grow up to be a well-rounded dog. An important part of training would be to enroll your dog into a training class. Most German Shorthaired Pointers make excellent watchdogs. The breed generally gets along well with other dogs, though females appear to be much more dominant during interbreed interaction. A strong hunting instinct is correct for the breed, which is not always good for other small pets such as cats or rabbits.\nThe German Shorthaired Pointer needs plenty of vigorous activity and thrives with lots of exercise and running. This need for exercise, coupled with the breed's natural instinct to hunt, means that training is an absolute necessity. The GSP's distinctly independent character means that any unused energy will likely result in the dog amusing itself, most probably in an undesirable manner.\nFailure by the owner to give this active and intelligent dog sufficient exercise and/or proper training can produce a German shorthaired pointer that appears hyperactive or that has destructive tendencies. Thus the breed is not a suitable pet for an inactive home or for inexperienced dog owners.  Although these dogs form very strong attachments with their owners, a bored GSP that receives insufficient exercise may feel compelled to exercise himself.  These dogs are athletic and can escape from four- to six-foot enclosures with little difficulty. Regular hunting, running, carting, bikejoring, skijoring, mushing, dog scootering or other vigorous activity can alleviate this desire to escape. The natural instinct to hunt may result in the dog hunting alone and sometimes bringing home occasional dead trophies, such as cats, rats, pigeons and other urban animals. In addition to exercise, especially formal hunting, the GSP needs to be taught to distinguish legitimate prey and off limits animals.\nLike the other German pointers (the German wirehaired pointer and the less well known German longhaired pointer), the GSP can perform virtually all gun dog roles. It is pointer and retriever, an upland bird dog and water dog. The GSP can be used for hunting larger and more dangerous game. It is an excellent swimmer but also works well in rough terrain. It is tenacious, tireless, hardy, and reliable. German Shorthaired Pointers are proficient with many different types of game and sport, including trailing, retrieving, and pointing pheasant, quail, grouse, waterfowl, raccoons, possum, and even deer.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nMost German shorthaired pointers are tough, healthy dogs, but the breed can be subject to a number of hereditary disorders due to their breeding. Some of these health disorders include, hypothyroidism, hip dysplasia, osteochondrosis dissecans (OCD), pannus, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), epilepsy, skin disorders and cancerous lesions in the mouth, on the skin and other areas of the body.  As with other breeds, un-spayed female GSPs are prone to breast cancer. This risk is reduced if they are spayed.\nMany factors, like genetics, environment, and diet can all contribute to hip dysplasia, which is a deformity of the hip joint. Not all German shorthaired pointers will develop displasia, but as the disease is determined by multi-genetic factors, only an OFA X-ray and screening by a qualified veterinary practitioner will determine whether the condition is present. No amount of exercise will correct it, and care should be taken to prevent slippage on smooth flooring. In severe cases, surgical correction may be required. Like many other deep-chested dogs, German shorthaired pointers are highly prone to gastric dilatation volvulus (GDV), also known as bloat. This is a life-threatening condition, requiring immediate veterinary treatment. GDV occurs especially if the dog is fed one large meal a day, eats rapidly, drinks large amounts of water after eating, or exercises vigorously after eating. In GDV, the stomach distends with gas or air and then twists (torsion), so that the dog is unable to rid the excess air in stomach through burping or vomiting. Also, the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded, causing a drop in blood pressure and the dog will go into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog may die. Some symptoms of GDV are: distended abdomen, excessive salivation, retching without throwing up, restlessness, depression, lethargy, and weakness. Precautions against GVD include: refraining from feeding immediately before or after exercise, feeding several smaller meals throughout the day instead of a single large meal, and avoiding the consumption of large amounts of water with dry food.As with any other hunting dog, contact with game can cause the spread of fungi and bacteria that can easily colonise in the gums or cause infections on open wounds and small cuts from scratching against plants and bushes during a regular hunting session.\n\n\n=== Care ===\nGerman Shorthaired Pointers along with other sporting dogs requires a lot of exercise and space to run.  GSPs have a lot of energy, they are one of the most energetic breeds. Therefore if not given the right amount of attention, they can become bored and destructive.  GSPs do not do well left alone all day or if relegated to a kennel without plenty of human interaction.\nGSPs are a very clean breed.  The short GSP coat needs very little grooming, just occasional brushing.  They typically shed constantly.  GSPs should be bathed only when needed.\nLike all dogs with flop ears, GSP can be prone to ear infections and their ears require regular checking and cleaning.\nThe GSP has a median lifespan of 9 years in a Danish survey and 12 years in a UK survey. In the UK survey about 1 in 8 lived to >15 years with the longest lived dog living to 17 years.As the GSP is a medium/large, active breed, the dogs can require considerable food.  Older or less active GSPs can also become obese if fed more than suitable for the individual's activity levels. A healthy weight should permit the last two ribs to be felt under the coat and the dog should have a distinct waist or \"tuck-up\".\nDue to the short GSP coat, body heat management is not generally a problem. However, the GSP's high levels of activity require the breed to drink considerable amounts of water to prevent dehydration. Early symptoms of dehydration show itself as thick saliva and urine with an excessively strong and distinct smell.\n\n\n== Current Uses ==\nGerman Shorthaired pointers are still currently used as versatile hunting and gun dogs. With their high intelligence and athleticism the German Shorthaired Pointer performs well in many AKC sports such as, Agility, Dock Diving, Obedience along with Service Dog work.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe precise origin of the German Shorthaired Pointer is unclear. According to the American Kennel Club, it is likely that the GSP is descended from a breed known as the German Bird Dog, which itself is related to the Old Spanish Pointer introduced to Germany in the 17th century. It is also likely that various German hound and tracking dogs, as well as the English Pointer and the Arkwright Pointer also contributed to the development of the breed. However, as the first studbook was not created until 1870, it is impossible to identify all of the dogs that went into creating this breed. The breed was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1930.\n\n\n== In art and literature ==\nThomas Mann's great love for his German Shorthaired is told in the book Bashan and I. \nRobert B. Parker's most popular mystery series features a Boston detective known only as Spenser who has had a series of three solid-liver German shorthairs, all named Pearl: one who stood with him during a bear charge in his rural youth; one given to his girlfriend by her ex-husband; and the third Pearl, to keep company with Spenser and his girlfriend in their late middle age. Author Parker appears on many of the Spenser dust jackets with a solid-liver GSP male identical to the three incarnations of Pearl in the series.\nRick Bass's ruminations on living and hunting with a German shorthaired pointer in Montana can be found in the book Colter: The True Story of the Best Dog I Ever Had.\nSportswriter Mel Ellis' memoir Run, Rainey, Run, explores the extraordinary relationship he had with an extremely intelligent and versatile hunting German shorthaired pointer.\nThe 1978 film \"Days of Heaven,\" written and directed by Terrence Malick, features a brief scene of dogs hunting the prairie. The GSP shown is Jocko von Stolzhafen, twice GSP National Champion (Field) and perhaps the best GSP of his era.  A year or so later Jocko vanished while running at a training camp, presumably stolen.\nThe logo of the Westminster Kennel Club is a Pointer, not a German shorthaired pointer, though frequently mistaken for the latter.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGerman Longhaired Pointer\nGerman Wirehaired Pointer\nEurohound\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAlderton, David (1984).

Descended from the old German breed, the Stoeberer (lit. \"rummager\"), which became popular with commoners following the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states, who required a versatile hunting dog. Stoeberer is now a type of hunting dog in Germany with the Wachtelhund being its sole member. The breed is not very well known outside of Germany, but was recognised by the United Kennel Club in 1996.\nA well built breed, its coat comes in brown shades with occasional white markings. It can be trained to retrieve game, as well as for tracking. It is related to the Small M\u00fcnsterl\u00e4nder (\u2033Heidewachtel\u2033) and the Drentse Patrijshond, all of which are descendants from the quail dog that at least date back to the 15th century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nFrederick Roberth, a German dog breeder, is credited with creating the modern Deutscher Wachtelhund around 1890. While several breeds feature in its makeup, the most prominent dog breed to be bred into the modern breed is the now extinct Stoeberer. The Stoeberer has been mentioned in literature as far back as 1719, and was thought to have a nose as powerful as a Bloodhound. Following the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states, the common man in the German states was allowed to hunt and needed a versatile hunting dog; this dog was the Stoeberer. In the late 19th century when Roberth was working on his new breed, he found specimens of the Stoeberer in Bavaria, and these dogs were crossed with water dogs and sporting spaniels to become the modern German Spaniel.In 1903, the Deutscher Wachtelhund was recognised as a breed, and following this the German breed club, the Verein fur Deutsche Wachtelhund (VDW), was organised. The term Stoeberer has since become a category of hunting dog in Germany with the Wachtelhund being the sole member of that category. In 1910, the VDW selected four male dogs and seven female dogs upon which to base the breed standard for the Wachtelhund. These dogs were selected from all over Germany, one coming from each region with two coming from Hannover. All of the modern registered German Spaniels today are descended from these eleven dogs.\n\nJohn Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon, Lord Chancellor of Great Britain owned a German Spaniel named Pincher, thought to be his favourite dog, which was painted by Edwin Henry Landseer. The dog originally belonged to his son William Henry, but became his constant companion. Lord Eldon would write of Pincher's behaviour in correspondence, for example to Lady F. J. Bankes in December 1831, \"When I got to Southampton, Pincher, who sends his kindest regards, marched up to the bed-room, in which I slept the last two times I was there. The chambermaid provided another room for me, the house being full of company, there being a ball at Southampton. Pincher was uneasy at this, and out of humour, and if he could speak, he would not have allowed it.\" Following Lord Eldon' death, a sum was left to his daughter Lady Frances specifically to pay for the care of the dog.Not usually kept as pets, these dogs owned by German foresters and professional hunters. In the 1960s and 70s several German Spaniels were imported into the United States, and descendants of those dogs are now used in Canada to track down and flush out American black bear. A further pair of dogs were brought to the United States in 1994, and the United Kennel Club recognised the breed in 1996, placing it in the Gundog Group.  There is thought to be about 100 German Spaniels in North America.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Deutscher Wachtelhund is a strong boned, muscular, medium-sized gundog with long thick wavy hair. It is solidly-built which allows it to retrieve heavy game such as hares and foxes. The ears are fairly long and should reach from half way to the nose, to the tip of the nose.  The size is approximately 18\u201321 inches (46\u201353 cm) at the withers.  Body length, from the nose to the base of the tail is twice the length of the dogs height. Average weight for both males and females of the breed is between 44\u201366 pounds (20\u201330 kg). Its life expectancy is 12 to 14 years.The coat is short and fine on the head, and long on the body, where it is strong, thick, wavy or curly, with enough undercoat to provide protection. It has a well feathered coat which is usually either brown or brown roan. Although brown, it can have white markings chest and/or legs, and may have white ticking anywhere on its body. Other colors that the coat can come in include red and white, and solid red. Plain black coats do not occur in the breed.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Deutscher Wachtelhund is a versatile gun dog. They are lively with a very strong hunting instinct and have a friendly attitude towards humans and other dogs. The Wachtelhund is quick to learn and adapt to new situations and has a great deal of courage. While not able to match the abilities of more specialized spaniels and retrievers they are able to hunt upland game, retrieve, track and blood trail large game successfully, making them popular among hunters who need a dog able to fulfil many roles adequately.\n\n\n== Outside Germany ==\nThis breed has gained numbers in Sweden along with the increase of the wild boar population in the south of the country, as well as the creation of crossbreeds with native spitzhounds to produce tough and brave dogs that will both give chase and \"stop\" or \"stand down\" the boar giving the hunter the chance to sneak in to kill the prey. They will also give a death bark or take down wounded game if trained to.\n\n\n== References ==\nSpecific\nGeneralDeutscher Wachtelhund of North America, http://www.deutscherwachtelhund.org wachtelhund\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nGerman Spaniel at Curlie"}, {"id": 215, "name": "German Spitz", "country": "Germany", "type": "Northern Breed", "picture": "dog215", "description": "German Spitz (or German spitz, plural spitzes or, borrowing from German, Spitze) is used to refer to both a standardized breed of dog (usually capitalized) in some kennel clubs, and a category or type of dog comprising several separate breeds.

The Wolfspitz and the Giant Spitz are divided primarily by colour, though the Keeshond tends to have a fuller coat and is taller and heavier.\nThe Mittelspitz, also Medium Spitz or Standard Spitz, is the ancestor of, and is sometimes taken to include, the American Eskimo Dog. The latter is allowed to be registered as Mittelspitz by some registries. Only the Canadian Kennel Club and the two major American kennel clubs recognize the American Eskimo Dog as a separate breed.\nThe German Spitz Klein, sometimes known as the Kleinspitz or Miniature Spitz, is allowed more colours than the larger German spitz varieties, under the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale standard. The Japanese Spitz, also bred from German spitz stock, is very similar to the Spitz Klein but is limited to the white colour and has a different breed history.\nThe Zwergspitz, also called the Pomeranian, is also registered as a separate breed in the UK and North America.The Kennel Club (UK) and the Australian Kennel Club recognize only the Kleinspitz and Mittelspitz. In those countries, the Grossespitz is not recognized, and the Pomeranian (Zwergspitz) and Keeshond (Wolfspitz) are separate breeds. In many countries the Miniature (Klein) Spitz is also confused with the Pomeranian (Zwergspitz). Some registries and breed clubs allow various sizes of German spitzes to be interbred, others do not.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nGerman spitzes are similar in appearance but vary in colour. The German Spitz breed is usually black, gold/cream and black, or white-ish; but the Standard, Small, and Dwarf can have various colour combinations as well. All German spitzes have a wolf- or fox-like head, double coat, high-set triangular ears, and a tail that is curled over the back. Although the Kleinspitz and the Pomeranian look similar, they are not the same dog.\n\n\n== History ==\nGerman spitzes, like all spitzes, have many physical features found in oldest stone-age fossil dogs in Central Europe, leading experts at the time to believe that the spitz is the oldest dog type.  However, modern genetic evidence places them in a much more recent lineage, dating the Wolfsspitz type to the nineteenth century. German spitzes was later brought to America, and was renamed American Eskimo Dog due to widespread anti-German sentiment during World War I, although other breeds (\"White Keeshonds\" and Pomeranians, along with Japanese Spitz) were also used in the formation of the American variety. The American Kennel Club recognizes the breeds as separate.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGerman Spitz World in the UK\nGerman Spitz Breeders & Owners Club in the UK"}, {"id": 216, "name": "German Wirehaired Pointer", "country": "Germany", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog216", "description": "The German Wirehaired Pointer is a medium to large-sized  griffon type breed of dog developed in the 19th century in Germany for hunting.  It became a leading gun dog in Germany in the later part of the 20th century. It is the result of the careful mixing and crossing of the griffon, German Shorthaired Pointer, Deutscher Stichelhaar, Deutscher Kurzhaar, and the hunting Pudelpointer in the late 19th century.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe German Wirehaired pointer is a well muscled, medium to large-sized dog of distinctive appearance. Balanced in size and sturdily built, the breed's most distinguishing characteristics are its weather resistant, wire-like coat and its facial furnishings. Typically pointer in character and style, the German wirehaired pointer is an intelligent, energetic and determined hunter. The tail is typically docked to two-fifths of the natural length. In countries where docking is prohibited the tail should be of sufficient length to reach down to the hocks. Like all German pointers, they have webbed feet. This dog is sometimes confused with the Spinone Italiano.\n\n\n==== Coat ====\nThe functional wiry coat is the breed's most distinctive feature. A dog must have a correct coat to be of correct type. The coat is weather resistant and water-repellent. The undercoat is dense enough in winter to insulate against the cold but is so thin in summer as to be almost invisible. The distinctive outer coat is straight, harsh, wiry and flat lying, and is from one to two inches in length. The outer coat is long enough to protect against the punishment of rough cover, but not so long as to hide the outline of the dog. On the lower legs the coat is shorter and between the toes it is of softer texture. On the skull the coat is naturally short and close fitting. Over the shoulders and around the tail it is very dense and heavy. The tail is nicely coated, particularly on the underside, but devoid of feather. Eyebrows are of strong, straight hair. Beard and whiskers are medium length. The hairs in the liver patches of a liver and white dog may be shorter than the white hairs. A short smooth coat, a soft woolly coat, or an excessively long coat is to be severely penalized when showing. While maintaining a harsh, wiry texture, the puppy coat may be shorter than that of an adult coat. The coat of the puppy should be shorter than 1 inch the adult coat should be kept at 1 inch long.\n\n\n==== Gait ====\nThe dog should be evaluated at a moderate gait. The movement is free and smooth with good reach in the forequarters and good driving power in the hindquarters. The topline should remain firm.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe German Wirehaired pointer is affectionate, lively, very determined, active and intelligent. Eager to learn and loyal to its family, it needs a handler who is consistent in approach. They like to be occupied, are vigorous and enjoy working for their owners. They are friendly with those they know, but are sometimes aloof with strangers and should be socialized at an early age. They often don't do well in a kennel environment.  German Wirehaired pointers are happiest and most well behaved when they are part of the family and can spend time with their people. They can be rather willful.  Some dogs have a tendency to roam.  Powerful and energetic, they can become bored and hard to manage without enough exercise. The German Wirehaired pointer is a good all-around gun dog, able to hunt any sort of game on any sort of terrain. This dog has a good nose and can track, point, and retrieve on both land and water. Loyal and playful, the German Wirehaired Pointer thrives on human companionship. However, they are still dogs, and all dogs may bite small children without adequate management and supervision. Although they are generally accepting of other dogs, they tend to focus upon the people in their family.\n\n\n=== Color ===\n\nThe Colors are: Liver (brown) and white or black and white ticked usually with some solid patches, and solid liver (brown) with or without a white chest patch.\n\n\n== Health ==\nVon Willebrands Disease type 2, hip dysplasia, heart disease.\n\n\n== History ==\nGerman Wirehaired pointers trace their origins back to 1880. They originated in Germany, where breeders wanted to develop a rugged, versatile hunting dog that would work closely with either one person or a small party of persons hunting on foot in varied terrain; from the mountainous regions of the Alps, to dense forests, to more open areas with farms and small towns. The breed the Germans desired had to have a coat that would protect the dogs when working in heavy cover or in cold water, yet be easy to maintain. Careful crosses of the German pointer with many other breeds. Sources differ on the exact lineage, though the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon, Pudelpointer, Stichelhaar, and Deutscher-Kurzhaar are commonly accepted as the most likely contributors. This is a dog that can fully respond to the needs of its hunter. The goal was to develop a wire-coated, medium-sized dog that could:\n\nSearch for, locate and point upland game\nWork both feather and fur with equal skill and retrieve water fowl\nBe a close-working, easily trained gun dog\nBe able to track and locate wounded game\nBe fearless when hunting \"sharp\" game such as fox\nBe a devoted companion and pet; and\nBe a watchdog for its owner's family and property.Some consider the \"Drahthaar\" (the original breed of German registry) to be a different type of dog than the domestic German wirehaired pointer. \nWhile the two breeds are genetically indistinguishable, all \"drahts\" must meet rigorous hunt and physical evaluations before being eligible for breeding. In addition to searching and pointing, these tests include the tracking and recovery of all game including wounded game such as fox, rabbit, deer and boar, which may not be required of a dog that hunts birds predominantly.  A desire to recover and retrieve game must be present in all \"drahts\" because of German statutes requiring the recovery of all game.\nFor upland (i.e. non-waterfowl) bird work, many GWPs have distinguished themselves with all-breed Field Championships and Master Hunter titles. When purchasing a working GWP,  attention needs to be paid to identifying breeders that place emphasis on all aspects of the versatile hunting dog. Among these breeders can be found accomplished dogs including Dual Championships (both field and show).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGerman shorthaired pointer\nGerman longhaired pointer\nBohemian wirehaired pointing griffon\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKoshyk, Craig (2011).

It is the largest of the three breeds of Schnauzer\u2014the other two breeds being the Standard Schnauzer and the Miniature Schnauzer. Numerous breeds were used in its development, including the black Great Dane, the Bouvier des Flandres, and the German Pinscher. Originally bred to assist on farms by driving livestock to market and guarding the farmer's property, the breed eventually moved into the city, where it worked guarding breweries, butchers' shops, stockyards and factories. It was unknown outside of Bavaria until it became popular as a military dog during World War I and World War II.\nThey have dense coarse coat that protects them from the weather and from vermin. Giant Schnauzers come in two color patterns: Solid black, and a color known as pepper and salt, with banded hairs of alternating white and black, appearing gray at a distance. Where legal, they are shown with cropped ears and docked tails. Like other schnauzers, they have a distinct beard and eyebrows. Today, the Giant Schnauzer participates in numerous dog sports, including Schutzhund. It is also used as a police dog.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first Giant Schnauzers emerged from Swabia in the German state of Bavaria, and W\u00fcrttemberg in the 17th century. These original Giant Schnauzers were considered a rough-coated version of the German Pinscher breeds, and their hair was thought to help them withstand the harsh German winters and bites from vermin. The origins of the breed are unclear, but sources speculate it originated through some combination of black Great Danes, German Shepherds, Rottweilers, Dobermanns, Boxers, Bouvier des Flandres, Thuringian Shepherds, and the Standard Schnauzer.The Giant Schnauzer was originally bred as a multipurpose farm dog for guarding property and driving animals to market. By the turn of the 20th century the Giant Schnauzer was being used as a watchdog at factories, breweries, butcheries, and stockyards throughout Bavaria. It was unknown outside Bavaria until it was used as a military dog in World War I and World War II. The first Giant Schnauzers were imported to America in the 1930s, but they remained rare until the 1960s, when the breed became popular. In 1962, there were 23 new Giant Schnauzers registered with the American Kennel Club; in 1974 this number was 386; in 1984 it was over 800 and in 1987 it was around 1000 animals. In 2012, there were 94 new dogs registered, down from 95 in 2011.In modern times, the Giant Schnauzer is used as a police dog; is trained for obedience, dog agility, herding, search and rescue, and schutzhund; and is shown in conformation shows. They are also used for carting. In Europe, the breed is considered to be more of a working dog than a show dog. The focus in many European Schnauzer clubs is not so much on conformation shows, but on the working ability of the breed. In several countries, including Germany, dogs must achieve a Schutzhund Champion title before they can qualify to be a conformation champion.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nAlthough the Giant Schnauzer is called 'Giant', this is not in comparison to other large dog breeds such as the Great Dane or the Rottweiler, but instead in comparison to the Standard and Miniature Schnauzers. The AKC breed standard calls for males to stand from 65 to 70 centimetres (25.5 to 27.5 in) at the withers, and for females to stand from 60 to 65 centimetres (23.5 to 25.5 in). Giant Schnauzers are square in shape, and should resemble a larger version of the Standard Schnauzer. The tail is long and the ears are small button ears carried high on the head. Where it is legal, it is possibly docked and the ears cropped.The head is 1/2 the length of the dog's back, when the back is measured from the withers to the base of the tail. The cheeks are flat, but well muscled. The coat is dense, wiry, and weather resistant. The fur on the Giant Schnauzer's face forms a distinct \"beard\" and eyebrows. Its stride is long and crisp.Giant Schnauzers come in two colors: solid black, and a pattern called pepper and salt, where banded hairs of black and white hairs cover the body, giving it the appearance of having been peppered and salted.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nGiant Schnauzers are usually a quiet breed. Due to its breeding, the Giant Schnauzer is inherently suspicious of strangers and can be very territorial. Once introduced, it is usually accepting of novel people or situations. It has the potential to be aggressive, but Giant Schnauzers are usually reserved - they are \"amiable in repose, and a commanding figure when aroused\"Giant Schnauzers have been described as trustworthy with children. They are very intelligent, and can become bored easily. They are also very energetic and highly spirited, which, when coupled with boredom, can lead to unwanted and destructive behavior. They are easily trained, and deeply loyal to their owner. Some breeders believe that pepper and salt colored Giant Schnauzers are more docile than their black-furred counterparts.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nGiant Schnauzers require regular grooming. Their beard can collect drool and food particles, making frequent cleanings essential. If being shown, their coat needs to be stripped every two to four weeks. If they are simply a companion animal, the coat can be clipped instead. Some Giant Schnauzers have an allergy to shampoo.Hip and elbow dysplasia are common. Giant Schnauzers are also prone to eye problems such as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma, cataracts, multifocal retinal dysplasia, and generalized progressive retinal atrophy. They are also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, vitiligo, and follicular cysts. Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility occurs because melanoma is caused by a defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color of the skin. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.Some Giant Schnauzers develop central diabetes insipidus, autosomal recessive hypothyroidism, selective malabsorption of cobalamin, narcolepsy, cataplexy, and various seizure disorders. Some are also sensitive to sulphonamides and gold. Bone diseases and joint problems are also an issue. The most common causes of death in Giant Schnauzers are lymphoma and liver cancer, followed by heart attacks and heart failure.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBlack Russian Terrier\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGiant Schnauzer at Curlie"}, {"id": 218, "name": "Glen of Imaal Terrier", "country": "Ireland", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog218", "description": "The Glen of Imaal Terrier (Irish: Brocaire U\u00ed Mh\u00e1il) is a breed of dog of the terrier category and one of four Irish terrier breeds. It is sometimes called the Irish Glen of Imaal Terrier or the Wicklow Terrier, and the name of the breed is often shortened by fanciers to just Glen.\nThe breed originates in, and is named for, the Glen of Imaal in County Wicklow, Ireland. It was recognised first by the Irish Kennel Club in 1934 and most recently by the American Kennel Club in 2004. The Canadian Kennel Club voted to fully recognize Glens in 2017 after the breed spent years on the Miscellaneous list; under the Animal Pedigree Act, this must be approved by Agriculture Canada, which is expected in 2018.\nReportedly, the Glen's history began during the reign of Elizabeth I, who hired French and Hessian mercenaries to put down a rebellion in Ireland. After the conflict, many of these soldiers settled in the Wicklow area. They brought with them their low-slung hounds, which they bred with the local terrier stock, eventually developing a distinctive breed that became known as the Glen of Imaal Terrier.\nGlens were originally used for eradicating other animals such as rat, fox, badger, and otter, and also as a general-purpose farm dog for herding and family companionship. Unlike many other terriers, they are \"strong dogs\" rather than \"sounders\"\u2014they were bred to work mute to ground, going silently into dens after their quarry rather than barking at it to alert their handlers. In hunting trials, which used to be required by many kennel clubs for championships, Glens were disqualified if they sounded at the quarry. For this reason, today they are among the quietest terriers.\nAccording to Irish lore, Glen of Imaal Terriers were also used as turnspit dogs to turn meat over fires for cooking. Evidence for this is scarce, and engravings of such dogs from the 19th century do not bear much resemblance to today's Glen. It is, however, repeated in many descriptions of the breed and often used in color commentary by dog show announcers.\nThe breed almost died out before being revived in the early twentieth century by breeders in its homeland. Today, the Glen of Imaal Terrier is still one of the rarest breeds of dog (in the US, living registered animals number in the hundreds) and the least-known Irish terrier breed. It is considered a vulnerable native breed by the UK's Kennel Club, which tracks breeds in which fewer than 300 puppies are registered each year.[1]\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nA \"big dog on short legs,\" the Glen of Imaal Terrier is an achondroplastic dwarf breed. It is more substantial than might be expected from photographs; a typical adult Glen weighs about 36 pounds and stands 14\" tall at the withers. The AKC breed standard specifies a height of 12\" to 14\" and a weight of \"approximately\" 35 pounds for males and \"somewhat less\" for females, with a length-to-height ratio of 5:3. Many champion Glens are larger than breed standard, with some individuals exceeding 40 or even 45 pounds. With three growth stages, a Glen can take up to four years to reach full maturity.\nGlens have a large head, with rose or half-prick ears; short, bowed legs; and a straight topline that rises slightly toward the tail. The shoulders, chest, and hips are sturdy and muscular (the AKC breed standard specifies an impression of \"maximum substance for size\") and the front feet are turned out. The breed is considered unrefined, with antique features that were common in early terriers but which have since fallen out of favor with fanciers and breeders.\n\nOn their back, Glens have a unique double coat that is wiry with a soft undercoat. The head, sides, and legs have only the softer coat, which typically develops a degree of waviness. The color of the coat may be wheaten or blue (the latter usually with brindling), with both wheaten and blue encompassing a range of shades. Other colorings do occasionally occur in Glens (including a mixture of wheaten and blue referred to as \"grizzle\" and a \"blue and tan\" that is blue on top with wheaten furnishings) but these rare variations, while not disqualifications, are not favored by fanciers.  \nWheaten Glen of Imaal puppies often have black highlights in their fur, and when young may show a \"dorsal stripe\" of darker fur down the middle of their backs, but this usually does not appear in their adult coat.\nThe Glen of Imaal terrier does not molt or shed much, and needs to be brushed or combed every week or two to keep the soft coat in good condition and free of matting. It is also typical to strip excess hair from the hard coat two to four times per year; this \"dead\" hair pulls out easily and painlessly with the proper tools.\nAlthough some extra grooming is needed for showing (for example, the light-colored soft undercoat is often \"carded\" from the back to enhance the color of the darker wiry coat), the Glen is intended to have a \"rough and ready\" appearance, and show grooming requires less effort than in many other breeds. Glens should look tidy but natural, never manicured or clipped, in the conformation ring.\nHistorically, the breed's tail was typically docked to a length just sufficient to serve as a handhold for pulling the dog out of a badger hole. Docking is still standard in the United States, though some breeders have stopped doing it, and an intact tail is not a fault in AKC conformation showing. Many countries, however, ban docking for showing completely. Ireland has banned showing of dogs whose tails were docked on or after March 6, 2014 (the procedure is also itself illegal with very limited exceptions). In the UK, working terriers can still be shown with docked tails, but dogs kept as pets cannot.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nA genetic test is available for progressive retinal atrophy (type crd3), a congenital disorder that gradually results in blindness beginning at about five years of age. As blindness from this cause did not become apparent until well into the breeding years, it was difficult to breed out this trait before the advent of the test. Completely eliminating the defective gene will be tricky even now, as breeding only clear-to-clear would severely restrict choices in an already small gene pool. It is straightforward, however, to produce litters that will never be affected by this type of PRA, even though some individuals in the litter may carry the gene. (Because the trait is recessive, animals with only one copy of the defective gene do not develop PRA, and it is necessary only that one parent be clear to achieve this.) Responsible breeders use the test to plan PRA-free litters and continue to test their animals' eyes annually to validate the test and to monitor for other eye problems.\nHeart problems are virtually nonexistent in the breed. Some Glen of Imaal Terriers suffer from allergies and skin itching, especially on paws, the typical problem with paws is redness, itching and sores during spells of wet weather. The Glen is not generally affected by the back problems common in certain other long-backed breeds. Hip dysplasia, though occasionally seen, is usually mild, and does not often result in lameness due to the breed's typically muscular build. Responsible breeders use OFA or PennHIP evaluations to ensure that their breeding stock's hips are healthy.\nBecause they are front-heavy and achondroplastic, young Glens are particularly susceptible to growth plate injuries that can significantly affect the development of front leg bones. Owners are advised to discourage their Glens from jumping off sofas, chairs, and beds until at least a year of age and to consult a veterinarian at the first sign of limping.\nAfter the age of 12 months, Glens generally do best on a diet lower in protein than other breeds.\n\n\n== Temperament and behavior ==\n\nGlen of Imaal terriers can be energetic and tenacious, but they tend to be more even-tempered, more easygoing, and less vocal than most other terriers. While they love activity, they are not demanding, and are happy to relax by their owner's side.\nTheir bark is deep and authoritative, like that of a much larger dog, and they are said to be good watch dogs.\nThe \"Glen sit,\" in which the dog sits on its hind end and holds its entire body vertical, is a posture not commonly seen in other breeds.\nAs terriers, Glens can have a stubborn streak, but they respond well to a firm hand and can withstand correction when necessary. They are intelligent, learn quickly, and socialize easily. They are typically fearless and loyal, and are superb with people, including children. However, some can be dog-aggressive, especially when provoked.\nBy maturity, most Glens develop a robust prey drive and will readily go for vermin such as rats, so they need to be well-socialized with other animals when young\u2014particularly with small household pets that they might mistake for quarry, such as cats and rabbits.\nGlens often do well at Earthdog trials, Barn Hunt, and in agility. Although not typically strong swimmers due to their short legs and dense body, some Glens can work in water, and others have been trained to herd and drive sheep and cattle.\n\n\n== Relationship to other breeds ==\nThough the exact origin of the Glen of Imaal Terrier is lost to history, some say that the breed may be related to the Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier, another Irish terrier breed (in fact, some sources claim all Irish terrier breeds to be derived from the Soft-Coated Wheaten) and/or the Kerry Blue Terrier. The \"low-slung hounds\" in the Glen's heritage are sometimes held to be forerunners of the PBGV and the source of the dwarfism. Though the Glen bears a passing resemblance to Scotland's Dandie Dinmont terrier, and even comes in two colors similar to the Dandie's \"mustard\" and \"pepper,\" it does not seem to be particularly closely related to that breed.\nDNA analysis indicates that the Glen of Imaal Terrier is more closely related to the mastiff-type dogs than it is to the terriers. The researchers noted that the Glen of Imaal Terrier was one of the breeds where genetic assignments conflict with phenotypic/functional designations.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGlen of Imaal Terrier at Curlie"}, {"id": 219, "name": "Golden Retriever", "country": "United Kingdom, Scotland", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog219", "description": "The Golden Retriever is a large-sized breed of dog bred as gun dogs to retrieve shot waterfowl, such as ducks and upland game birds, during hunting and shooting parties, and were named 'retriever' because of their ability to retrieve shot game undamaged (soft mouth). Golden retrievers have an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards. They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner coat that provides them with adequate warmth in the outdoors, and an outer coat that lies flat against their bodies and repels water. Golden retrievers are well suited to residency in suburban or country environments. They shed copiously, particularly at the change of seasons, and require fairly regular grooming. The Golden Retriever was originally bred in Scotland in the mid-19th century.The breed is a prominent participant in conformation shows for purebred dogs. The Golden Retriever is popular as a disability assistance dog, such as being a guide dog for the blind and a hearing dog for the deaf. In addition, they are trained to be a hunting dog, a detection dog, and a search and rescue participant. The breed's friendly, gentle temperament means it is unsuited to being a professional guard dog, but its temperament has also made it the third-most popular family dog breed (by registration) in the United States,\nthe fifth-most popular in Brazil and Australia,\nand the eighth-most popular in the United Kingdom. Golden Retrievers are rarely choosy eaters, but require ample (two or more hours a day) exercise. The breed is fond of play but also highly trainable.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe Golden Retriever is a large, strongly built breed with a dense, water-repellant wavy coat. As a dog with origins in pedigree breeding, and owing to its widespread historical popularity, some regional variations have emerged in the breed; therefore, the three subtypes of the Golden Retriever reflect the typical variations in dimensions and coat. However, all Golden Retrievers are blonde, yellow, or gold in colour, and all subtypes are susceptible to the same health problems.\n\n\n=== British ===\n\nBritish-type Golden Retrievers are prevalent throughout Europe and Australia. The skull is broader and the forequarters are more muscular than in other types. The muzzle is balanced and well chiseled. The coat is generally lighter in colour than in the American types. Males stand between 22 to 24 in (56 to 61 cm) at the withers; females are between 20 to 22 in (51 to 56 cm). Acceptable or expected weights are not specified in the UK standard, but the Kennel Club standard calls for a level topline and straight hindquarters without the slight rear angulation found in American lines.The eyes are round and dark, which is in contrast to the triangular or slanted composition of their American counterparts. British Golden Retrievers can have a coat colour of any shade of gold or cream; red or mahogany are not permitted. Originally, cream was an unacceptable colour in the UK standard, but the standard was revised in 1936 to include cream. At the time of this revision, the exclusion of cream as a colour was agreed to as a mistake, as the original \"yellow\" retrievers of the 19th century were actually lighter in colour than was permitted by the standards used before 1936. As with American lines, white is an unacceptable colour in the show ring. The British Kennel Club standard is used in all countries except the USA and Canada. Golden retrievers have muscular bodies with great endurance, owing to their origins as hunting and gundogs.\n\n\n=== American ===\n\nAmerican types are lankier and less muscular than other types, males stand between 23 and 24 in (58 and 61 cm) in height at the withers; females are 21.5 to 22.5 in (55 to 57 cm) tall. Their coats are darker in colour and occur in various shades of lustrous gold with moderate feathering. When trotting, they have a free, smooth, powerful, and well-coordinated gait; as the dog runs, its feet converge towards the center of the line of balance. The American standard also makes requirements about the proportion, substance, head and skull, neck, body, topline, forequarters, and hindquarters; in these respects, the American-type Retriever is the same as Golden Retrievers that conform to other national standards. American breeders of Golden Retrievers sometimes import their dogs from Britain to take advantage of the temperament and appearance of the British types.\n\n\n=== Canadian ===\n\nThe Canadian Golden Retriever has a thinner and darker coat and stands taller than other types. Males stand 23 and 24 in (58 and 61 cm) in height at withers; and females 21.5 to 22.5 in (55 to 57 cm). Weight for males is between 29\u201334 kg (65-75 lb); and females between 27\u201332 kg (60-70 lb).\n\n\n== Coat and colour ==\nAs indicated by their name, their coats occur in light golden to dark golden colours. The topcoat is water-resistant and slightly wavy, and sheds in small amounts throughout the year. The undercoat is soft and keeps the retriever cool in summer and warm in winter; it sheds in the spring and fall. It usually lies flat against the belly. The Golden's coat should never be too long, as this may prove to be a disservice to it in the field, especially when retrieving game. Golden Retrievers have mild feathering on the backs of their fore legs and heavier feathering on the fronts of their necks, backs of their thighs and the bottoms of their tails.The American Kennel Club (AKC) standard states the coat is a \"rich, lustrous golden of various shades\", disallowing extremely light or extremely dark coats. This leaves the outer ranges of coat colour up to a judge's discretion when competing in conformation shows. Therefore, \"pure white\" and \"red\" are unacceptable, as is black. The Kennel Club (UK) also permits cream as an acceptable coat colour. Judges may also disallow Goldens with pink noses, or those lacking pigment. The Golden's coat can also be mahogany, referred to as \"redhead\", although this is not accepted in the British show ring.  As a Golden grows older, its coat can become darker or lighter, along with a noticeable whitening of the fur on and around the muzzle. Puppy coats are usually much lighter than their adult coats, but a puppy with darker ear tips may indicate a darker adult colour.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe temperament of the Golden Retriever is a hallmark of the breed, and is described in the standard as \"kindly, friendly and confident\". Golden Retrievers make good family pets, particularly as they are patient with children. They are not \"one-man dogs\" and are generally equally amiable with both strangers and those familiar to them. Their trusting, gentle disposition makes them a poor guard dog. Any form of unprovoked aggression or hostility towards either people, dogs or other animals, whether in the show ring or community, is considered unacceptable in a Golden Retriever and is not in keeping with the character of the breed, nor should a Golden Retriever be unduly timid or nervous. The typical Golden Retriever is calm, naturally intelligent and biddable, and with an exceptional eagerness to please.\nGolden Retrievers are also noted for their intelligence. The breed ranks fourth in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs \u2013 following the Border Collie, Poodle, and German Shepherd \u2013 as one of the brightest dogs ranked by obedience-command trainability.\nTypical Golden Retrievers are active and fun-loving animals with the exceptionally patient demeanour befitting a dog bred to sit quietly for hours in a hunting blind. Adult Goldens love to work, and have a keen ability to focus on a given task. They will work until they collapse, so care should be taken to avoid overworking them.\nOther characteristics related to their hunting heritage are a size suited for scrambling in and out of boats and an inordinate love for water. Golden Retrievers are exceptionally trainable\u2014due to their intelligence, athleticism and desire to please their handlers\u2014and excel in obedience trials. They are also very competitive in agility and other performance events. Harsh training methods are unnecessary, as Golden Retrievers often respond very well to positive and upbeat training styles.Golden Retrievers are compatible with other dogs, cats, and most livestock. They are particularly valued for their high level of sociability towards people, calmness, and willingness to learn. Because of this, they are commonly used as guide dogs, mobility assistance dogs, and search and rescue dogs.\n\n\n== Health and lifespan ==\n\nThe average lifespan for a Golden Retriever is about 11 to 12 years. The breed is susceptible to specific ailments, so pets should be taken to a veterinarian for yearly checkups.\nGolden Retrievers are known to have genetic disorders and other diseases. Hip dysplasia is common in the breed; when buying a puppy, the pedigree should be known and be examined by the OFA or by PennHIP for hip disease. Obesity is also common in the breed because Golden Retrievers love to eat. Puppies should eat about three cups of food a day and adults three to five cups, depending on the food and how active the dog is.\n\n\n== Common health problems ==\nCancer is the breed's biggest killer, causing 61.4% of American Golden deaths according to a 1998 health study conducted by the Golden Retriever Club of America. The most common is hemangiosarcoma, followed by lymphosarcoma, mast cell tumour, and osteosarcoma. A 2004 survey by the UK Kennel Club puts this number at 38.8%. Although most puppies are screened for the disorders before being sold (by reputable breeders), hip and elbow dysplasia afflict one-fifth of dogs. Eye diseases are also possible in the breed; cataracts are the most common eye disease, but they can also be afflicted with progressive retinal atrophy, glaucoma, distichiasis, entropion, corneal dystrophy, and retinal dysplasia.\n\nThey may suffer from heart disease, especially subvalvular aortic stenosis, and cardiomyopathy and joint diseases, including patella luxation, osteochondritis, panosteitis, and cruciate ligament rupture. In addition to the heavy shedding they experience (and their constant lighter shedding throughout the year), Golden Retrievers can suffer from skin diseases; the most prevalent skin problem is allergies (often leading to acute moist dermatitis or \"hot spots\"), with the most common allergy being to fleas. They can also suffer from seborrhoea, sebaceous adenitis, self-inflicted lick granuloma, and haemophilia.\n\n\n== Grooming ==\n \nGolden Retrievers require regular grooming and occasional baths. Their coats shed somewhat during the year, but are known to shed profusely twice a year. They also need to have their ears cleaned regularly, or ear infections might occur. While shedding is unavoidable, frequent grooming (daily to weekly) lessens the amount of hair shed by the animal. Severe shedding resulting in bald patches can be indicative of stress or sickness.\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\nThe Golden Retriever's eagerness to please has made it a consistent, top performer in the obedience and agility rings. Its excellent swimming ability makes it proficient at dock jumping. A natural retrieving ability means it is also competitive in flyball and field trials.The first three dogs ever to achieve the AKC Obedience Champion title were Golden Retrievers; the first of the three was a female named 'Ch. Moreland's Golden Tonka'.Since Golden Retrievers are so trainable, they are used for many important jobs, such as guide dogs for blind people, drug or bomb sniffing at airports, or helping to rescuing people from earthquakes and other natural disasters. This breed is also used in water rescue/lifesaving, along with the Leonberger, Newfoundland and Labrador Retriever dogs.\n\n\n== Origins and history ==\n\nThe Golden Retriever was originally bred in Scotland in the mid-19th century. At that time, wildfowl hunting was a popular sport for the wealthy Scottish elite, but the existing retriever breeds were inadequate for retrieving downed game from both water and land. Retrieving from both land and water was necessary because the hunting grounds of the time were pocketed with marshy ponds and rivers. Consequently, the best water spaniels were crossed with the existing retrievers, resulting in the establishment of the breed today known as the Golden Retriever. The Golden Retriever was first developed near Glen Affric in Scotland, at \"Guisachan\", the highland estate of Dudley Marjoribanks, 1st Baron Tweedmouth. For many years, what breeds were originally crossed was disputed, but in 1952, the publication of Marjoribanks' breeding records from 1835 to 1890 dispelled the myth concerning the purchase of a whole troupe of Russian tracker sheepdogs from a visiting circus; instead it details a careful line-breeding program. Commonly, the breed is said to have originated from the Russian tracker.Improvements in guns during the 1800s resulted in more fowl being downed during hunts at greater distances and over increasingly difficult terrain, leading to more birds being lost in the field. Because of this improvement in firearms, a need for a specialist retriever arose, as training setter and pointer breeds in retrievals was found to be ineffective. Thus, work began on the breeding of the dog to fill this much-needed role.The original cross was of a yellow-coloured retriever, 'Nous', with a Tweed Water Spaniel female dog, 'Belle'. The Tweed Water Spaniel is now extinct, but was then common in the border country. Marjoribanks had purchased Nous in 1865 from an unregistered litter of otherwise black wavy-coated retriever pups. In 1868, this cross produced a litter that included four pups; these four became the basis of a breeding program which included the Irish Setter, the sandy-coloured Bloodhound, the St. John's water dog of Newfoundland, and two more wavy-coated black retrievers. The bloodline was also inbred and selected for trueness to Marjoribanks' idea of the ultimate hunting dog. His vision included a more vigorous and powerful dog than previous retrievers, one that would still be gentle and trainable. Russian sheepdogs are not mentioned in these records, nor are any other working dog breeds. The ancestry of the Golden Retriever is all sporting dogs, in line with Marjoribanks' goals. The Golden Retriever was active and powerful and had a gentle mouth for retrieving games while on hunts.Organisations other than clubs are dedicated to Golden Retrievers, such as breed-specific adoption sites. One such organisation is the Golden Retriever Club of Scotland, which in August 2013 assembled 222 Golden Retrievers at the historical home of the first Golden Retrievers.\n\n\n=== In the United Kingdom ===\n\nGolden Retrievers were first accepted for registration by The Kennel Club in 1903, as Flat Coats \u2013 Golden. They were first exhibited in 1908, and in 1911 were recognized as a breed referred to as Retriever (Golden and Yellow).\n\n\n==== In Scotland ====\nIn July 2006, the Golden Retriever Club of Scotland organized a gathering of Golden Retriever enthusiasts at the ancestral home, Guisachan House. A photograph taken by photographer Lynn Kipps to commemorate the occasion captured 188 Golden Retrievers, and so holds the record for the most Golden Retrievers in one image.\n\n\n=== In the United States ===\nIt took another 14 years for the breed to be recognized in America, and in 1925, the American Kennel Club did so. In 1938, the Golden Retriever Club of America was founded. Golden Retrievers are ranked number two for American Kennel Club Registrations. As of the year 1999, 62,652 have been registered and the only breed above them is the Labrador Retriever. According to the purebred dog guide recognized by the American Kennel Club, Golden Retrievers are judged based on a variety of traits: colour, coat, ears, feet, nose, body, etc.\n\n\n=== In Canada ===\nThe Honourable Archie Marjoribanks took a Golden Retriever to Canada in 1881, and registered 'Lady' with the AKC in 1894. These are the first records of the breed in these two countries. The breed was first registered in Canada in 1927, and the Golden Retriever Club of Ontario (GRCO) was formed in 1958. The cofounders of the GRCO were Cliff Drysdale, an Englishman who had brought over an English Golden, and Jutta Baker, daughter-in-law of Louis Baker, who owned Northland Kennels. The GCRO in later years expanded to become the Golden Retriever Club of Canada.\n\n\n=== Notable dogs ===\nLiberty, the presidential pet of President Gerald R. Ford, and Victory, the presidential pet of Ronald Reagan, were Golden Retrievers. The breed has also featured in a number of films and TV series, including the Air Bud film series, Full House, Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey and Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco, Fluke, Napoleon, Up, Pushing Daisies,  You've Got Mail, The Drew Carey Show, and Cats & Dogs. Cash from The Fox and the Hound 2 was also a mix of this breed, as was Whopper from Pound Puppies.\nA female Golden Retriever named Goldie appeared on the UK BBC One children's programme Blue Peter from 1978 to 1986. Monty Don, a presenter of the UK BBC Two gardening programme Gardeners' World has a male Golden Retriever called Nigel who appears with him most of the time on the programme. A Golden Retriever portrayed the role of Levi, the hearing dog of the titular deaf FBI agent in Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye, based on the life of the real Sue Thomas.\nOrca, awarded the PDSA Gold Medal for animal bravery\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGolden Retriever at Curlie"}, {"id": 220, "name": "Gordon Setter", "country": "United Kingdom, Scotland", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog220", "description": "The Gordon Setter is a large breed of dog, a member of the setter family that also includes both the better-known Irish Setter and the English Setter. Setter breeds are classified as members of either the Sporting or Gundog Group depending on the national kennel club or council.  The original purpose of the breed was to hunt gamebirds. Their quarry in the United Kingdom, may be partridge or grouse, pheasant, ptarmigan, blackgame, snipe or woodcock: whilst overseas bird dogs are worked on quail, willow grouse, sand grouse, guinea fowl, sagehen, francolin and any other bird that will sit to a dog\u2014that is to say, will attempt to avoid a potential predator by concealment rather than by taking to the wing at the first sign of danger.  It is this combination of a bird that will sit fast in front of a dog that will remain on point that makes bird dog work possible.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nGordon Setters, also known as \"black and tans\", have a coal-black coat with distinctive markings of a rich chestnut or mahogany colour on their paws and lower legs, vents, throat, and muzzles; one spot above each eye; and two spots on their chest. A small amount of white is allowed on the chest. Although uncommon, red Gordons are occasionally born to normal-coloured parents, the result of expression of a recessive red gene. Predominantly tan, red, or buff dogs are ineligible for showing. A Gordon's coat is straight or slightly waved (but not curly), long and silky, with chest, stomach, ear, leg, and tail feathering. According to the AKC breed standard, \"the bearing is intelligent, noble, and dignified\". They are the heaviest of the setter breeds, with males reaching 27 inches (69 cm) at the withers and up to 80 pounds (36 kg) in weight.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe AKC describes the Gordon Setter temperament as \"alert, interested, and confident. He is fearless and willing, intelligent, and capable. He is loyal and affectionate, and strong-minded enough to stand the rigors of training\". Gordons are intensely loyal to their owners; thrive in an attentive, loving environment; and are good family dogs. Puppies and adult dogs can be quite boisterous, and although they are patient by nature, may not be suitable for households with very young children. Gordons are sensitive and empathic, eager to learn, and need firm but gentle handling. Early socialisation and obedience training is important. The breed is one of the slowest to mature, not hitting prime until three years of age or more, and will show puppy-like characteristics well into their older years.\nGordons were bred to run, and require 60 to 80 minutes of vigorous exercise daily. Young dogs should not be over-exercised or begin agility training until they are at least 18 months old, to avoid joint problems later in life. Because of their hunting instincts, Gordons should not be allowed to roam freely if unsupervised, as they are apt to wander into a potentially dangerous traffic situation while following a scent.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nAlthough not as prone to hip dysplasia as many of the larger breeds, Gordons can suffer from the condition. Other health issues can include hypothyroidism, gastric torsion (bloat) and eye diseases such as progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), and cataracts. Life expectancy for the breed is generally about 10 to 12 years.At the beginning of 2009, a report was issued to all of the Breed Clubs in the UK concerning cases of late onset PRA in Gordon Setters.\nOn March 14, 2011, Animal Health Trust (AHT) made a DNA test available.  The mutation is termed rcd4 (for rod-cone degeneration 4) to distinguish it from other, previously described forms of rod-cone degeneration. It is recessive, and 19 out of the 21 Gordons in their study who had clinical signs of PRA were homozygous for this mutation, indicating it is the major cause of PRA in the breed.\nAs many as 50% of Gordon Setters may be carriers.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\"Domesticated Dogs Finding Their Game by Scent, But Not Killing It, Being Chiefly Used in Aid of the Gun\".The Dog In Health & Disease\u2014Longmans, Green & Co. 1859\nThis is the title of the chapter covering pointers and setters in Stonehenge's work on dogs published around a hundred and fifty years ago.  The term \"gun dogs\" would pretty well cover all the dogs described in the chapter.  Many of the gun dogs described by Stonehenge are no longer to be found in the United Kingdom or have been absorbed into one of the other breeds.  The Russian Setter, the Welsh Setter, Northern Irish Water Spaniel, Southern Irish Water Spaniel and English Water Spaniel, the Spanish Pointer and the Portuguese Pointer have all disappeared in the past hundred and fifty years, and the pictures of some of the breeds that are still with us show considerable differences to the breed as we see them today. Edward Laverick wrote in The Setter, published in 1872: \"the setter is but an improved spaniel\"; while the Rev Pearce in The Dog, published in the same year, said, 'he is a direct descendant of the Spaniel: \"a Setting Spaniel\" was the first Setter'. Since then this is the generally agreed with conclusion that the Setter was primarily derived from the old Land Spaniel, so called so as to distinguish it from the Water Spaniel.  It is however likely that outside crosses with Hounds or Pointers did influence its development.  William Taplin in The Sportsman's Cabinet (1803\u201304) maintained that it was \"originally produced by a commixture between the Spanish pointer and the larger breed of the English spaniel\".\n\nWe now really need not  to go back to the Spaniel and its specialised development into the setting-dog, as it was called, and can be found in the work by the famous French sportsman, Gaston de Foix, Vicomte de B\u00e9arn (1331\u201391), who it is said owned about 1500 dogs 'brought from all countries of Europe' and was known as 'Gaston Ph\u00e8bus' owing to his love for the chase.  This work is called Livre de Chasse or Miroir de Ph\u00e8bus, and was started in 1387. This work was the bases of The Master of Game written between 1406 and 1413 by Edward III's grandson, Edward, second Duke of York, who acknowledged his debt to de Foix.  Below is the main passage referring to the Spaniel and the Setting-dog, as republished in 1904:\n\n\u2014Baillie-Grohman, p. 66\nThe modern Gordon Setter is a predominantly black dog with rich tan marking on the muzzle, legs and chest.  A little bigger and heavier than either the Irish or English, he is nevertheless descended from the same genetic mixing pot, which undoubtedly has its origins among those setting spaniels we met earlier.  The Kennel Club applied the name 'Gordon Setter' to the breed in 1924.  Before that they were known as black and tan setters, and were found in many kennels beside those of the Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon (1743\u20131827).  Indeed, as we shall see, there is plenty of evidence that the majority of the setters at Gordon Castle during the Duke's time were tri-coloured rather than pure black and tan.\nThe breed was brought to the United States by George Blunt and Daniel Webster in 1842, with the purchase of two dogs named Rake and Rachel from the Duke's kennels. The American Kennel Club officially recognised the breed in 1892.\n\n\n=== Breed development ===\n\n\n==== The Gordon Setter as a gundog in the United Kingdom ====\nAmong the many changes which took place in sport and country affairs during the last century where those concerned with the method of shooting and consequent role of the gundog.   These changes were accelerated after the Second World War, prior to which there were many \"dogging moors\" in the north of the UK, especially in Scotland.  Walking up game became largely superseded by driving and field-craft by marksmanship.  The function of the gundog was as a result limited to the recovery of dead or wounded birds and \u2013 in the age of specialisation \u2013 this meant that the Labrador Retriever came to the forefront while the number of working pointers and setters declined year after year.\nBesides the modernisation of the style of shooting and the work required of gundogs, the situation was altered by the new developments that also took place in farming, which helped to bring about a marked reduction in the partridge population.  This came about with the introduction of modernisation such as early cutting of silage, the use of fast-moving mechanical equipment, the burning or ploughing of stubble-fields soon after harvest, the destruction of hedgerows and the use of chemical sprays for weed-killing.  The hedgerows had provided shelter and nesting sites; the weeds and other herbage supplied food and cover; whilst the stubble-fields had been a primary source of winter food; so the partridges were deprived of some important assets, whilst the wide use of chemicals on the land exercised a direct harmful effect.\nIt will be obvious to the reader that these changes significantly affected the status of setters and pointers, not least that of the Gordon.  Though often used as a general purpose gundog, the Gordon Setter is essentially a wide-ranging dog employed in the U.K. to locate red grouse and ptarmigan on the Scottish or North of England moors and partridges on the stubble-fields of the south of England.  Up to the late 1930s most Gordons were kept for this type of work, so that the majority were to be found in Scotland and the north of England; but now they are more evenly distributed and there are no large working kennels.\nThe function of the setter is well summarised by Captain Blaine as follows: \u2018The work required of the setter and pointer differs from that of all other breeds of dog. It is their business to range and hunt independently for game, at a distance from the sportsman, using their own initiative and intelligence to find it, and having done so, to remain staunchly \u201con point\u201d awaiting his approach. They must search for the body, and not for the foot scent, and be able to maintain a fast steady gallop for long periods without fatigue.  For the purpose a dog should have independence of character, speed, endurance, and a sensitive nose, combined with natural ability for hunting the terrain, in the best method of finding game\u2019 (Croxton Smith, 1932, p70).\nTwo Gordon Setters have achieved the title of Dual Champion. The first was a bitch whose registered name was Amscot Irresista Belle; her pet name was Trisca.   The second was Trisca's relative, Boyers Scarlatti.  \"These girls are the only setters of any breed to achieve this in the UK, with the incredibly high standards set in the UK field and show ring.\"   The Kennel Club regulations state this title can only be claimed by dogs who have achieved the title of Show Champion and Field Trial Champion.Perhaps one of the best descriptions of the setter at work in the field is a poem by the poet William Somerville (1675\u20131742) in the following lines:\n\n\n==== The Gordon Castle and other historically important kennels ====\nAlexander, the 4th Duke of Gordon (1743\u20131827), established his kennel of Black and Tan Setters at Gordon Castle, which was situated near Fochabers, not far from the River Spey and a few miles from the coast of Moray. The exact date when this occurred is not known. A Colonel Thornton visited the place during his tour of the Highlands in 1786. He makes no mention of any kennel of Setters at that time, although he does note that \u2018The Duke of Gordon still keeps up a diversion of falconry\u2026.I saw, also, here a true Highland greyhound, which is now become very scarce\u2026.\u2019. The Duke was indeed devoted to country pursuits and was among the last of his day in Scotland to keep hawks and practise falconry; he was celebrated for his Scottish Deerhounds as well as his Setters. However all that can be inferred from the Colonel\u2019s remarks is that there are unlikely to have been any Setters of note at the Castle in 1786.\nThere is much on record that seems reliable about the origin or derivation of the Duke of Gordon\u2019s Setters, though verification at this late date is of course impossible.  Most of this evidence comes from Samuel Brown, the Veterinary Surgeon of Melton Mowbray, who was a great authority on the breed.  In a letter to \u2018\u2019The Field\u2019\u2019 of 12 November 1864 Samuel Brown stated: \u2018An old gentleman sportsman, and one too who has shot over the same breed for fifty years and knew them during his boyhood, assures me that the late Duke of Gordon, Marquis of Anglesey, and several other noblemen, had their original stock of setters from the late Mr Coke of Longford, and that the colour was usually black-white- and -tan.  Mine are descended from the original breed of Mr Coke, the Gordon \u2018\u2019Regent\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Fan\u2019\u2019, and within the last five years from a black-white-and \u2013tan bitch which I got direct from the Beaudesart kennel\u2019 (i.e. the Marquees of Anglesey\u2019s \u2013 Ed.).  Five years late, in another letter to the same journal, the Rev F. W. Adye wrote: \u2018Mr Brown was told by Mr Coke himself that he often sent dogs to the Duke of Gordon and received others in exchange, in order now and then to obtain fresh blood\u2019 (\u2018\u2019The Field,\u2019\u2019 8 January 1870).  These facts were well known to J. H. Walsh (\u2018Stonehenge\u2019), Editor of \u2018\u2019The Field\u2019\u2019 and a leading authority on sporting dogs, for it is he who mentions in the first chapter of his book  \u2018\u2019The Dogs of the British Islands\u2019\u2019 (1867) a Setter \u2018from Mr Coke of Norfolk and doubtless related to the late Duke of Gordon\u2019s kennel, as Mr Coke and the duke bred together and interchanged setters frequently\u2019.  Therefore, it does appear to be reasonably established that Mr Coke provided most of the original Setters for the Duke\u2019s kennel.  The Rev Hutchinson, who wrote under the pseudonym \u2018Sixty-one\u2019, insisted that \u2018the original setter taken or sent to Gordon Castle by the first Marquis of Anglesea\u2019 (\u2018\u2019The Field\u2019\u2019, 29 January 1870), however what has been seen is that, according to Samuel Brown\u2019s \u2018old gentleman sportsman\u2019, the Marquees of Anglesey likewise had his original stock of Setters at Beaudesart from Mr Coke \u2013 probably, although this cannot be confirmed, some years before the Gordon Castle kennel was founded; for in 1869 the Beaudesart Setters were said to have been maintained \u2018for sixty years pure and unmixed with any blood\u2019 (\u2018\u2019The Field\u2019\u2019, 11 December 1869).  It is most unlikely that the Duke obtained his setters from only one source, we know that he interbreed with other kennels besides Mr Coke\u2019s, notably with Lord Lovat\u2019s.\n\nGordon Setters exercising\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBaillieGrohman, William A. and F (Ed.), The Masters of Game: Edward, Second Duke of York: The Oldest English Book on Hunting, limited edition with 4 plates, London 1904.

The French name is Dogue Allemand.The record holder for tallest dog was a Great Dane called Zeus (died September 2014; aged 5), that measured 111.8 cm (44.0 in) from paw to shoulder.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nLarge boarhounds appear in ancient Greece, in frescoes from Tiryns dating back to the 14th\u201313th centuries BC. These large boarhounds continue to appear throughout ancient Greece in subsequent centuries up to the Hellenistic era.In Austria and Germany the Molossian hound, Suliot dog, and specific imports from Greece were used in the 18th century to increase the stature of the boarhounds whereas, in Ireland, it was done for the wolfhounds. Bigger dogs are depicted on numerous runestones in Scandinavia, on Danish coinage from the fifth century AD, and in the Poetic Edda (a collection of Old Norse poems). The University of Copenhagen Zoological Museum holds at least seven skeletons of very large hunting dogs, dating from the fifth century BC to 1000 AD.\n\n\n=== Hunting dog ===\n\nIn the middle of the 16th century, the nobility in many countries of Europe imported strong, long-legged dogs from England, which were descended from crossbreeds between English Mastiffs and Irish Wolfhounds. They were dog hybrids in different sizes and phenotypes with no formal breed. These dogs were called Englische Docke or Englische Tocke \u2013 later written and spelled: Dogge \u2013 or Englischer Hund  in Germany. The name simply meant \"English dog.\" Since then, the English word \"dog\" has come to be associated with a molossoid dog in Germany and France. These dogs were bred in the courts of German nobility, independent of the English methods, since the start of the 17th century.The dogs were used for hunting bear, boar, and deer at princely courts, with the favorites staying at night in the bedchambers of their lords. These Kammerhunde (chamber dogs) were outfitted with gilded collars, and helped protect the sleeping princes from assassins.While hunting boar or bears, the Englische Dogge was a catch dog used after the other hunting dogs to seize the bear or boar and hold it in place until the huntsman was able to kill it. When the hunting customs changed, particularly because of the use of firearms, many of the involved dog types disappeared. The Englische Dogge became rare, and was kept only as a dog of hobby or luxury.\n\n\n=== Name change ===\nIn the 19th century, the dog was known as a \"German boarhound\" in English-speaking countries.\nSome German breeders tried to introduce the names \"German Dogge\" and \"German Mastiff\" on the English market, because they believed the breed should be marketed as a dog of luxury and not as a working dog. However, due to the increasing tensions between Germany and other countries, the dog later became referred to as a \"Great Dane\", after the grand danois in Buffon's Histoire naturelle, g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et particuli\u00e8re in 1755.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Great Dane is a large German domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) known for its giant size.As described by the American Kennel Club:\n\nThe Great Dane combines, in its regal appearance, dignity, strength, and elegance with great size and a powerful, well-formed, smoothly muscled body. It is one of the giant working breeds, but is unique in that its general conformation must be so well balanced that it never appears clumsy, and shall move with a long reach and powerful drive. The Great Dane is a short-haired breed with a strong, galloping figure. In the ratio between length and height, the Great Dane should be square. The male dog should not be less than 30 in (76 cm) at the shoulders, a female 28 in (71 cm). Danes under minimum height are disqualified. From year to year, the tallest living dog is typically a Great Dane. Previous record holders include Gibson, Titan, and George; however, the current record holder is a black Great Dane named Zeus that stood 111.8 cm (44.0 in) at the shoulder before his death in September 2014. He was also the tallest dog on record (according to Guinness World Records), beating the previous holder, the aforementioned George that stood 109.2 cm (43.0 in) at the shoulder.The minimum weight for a Great Dane over 18 months is 120 lb (54 kg) for males, 100 lb (45 kg) for females. Unusually, the American Kennel Club dropped the minimum weight requirement from its standard. The male should appear more massive throughout than the female, with a larger frame and heavier bone.Great Danes have naturally floppy, triangular ears. In the past, when Great Danes were commonly used to hunt boars, cropping of the ears was performed to make injuries to the dogs' ears less likely during hunts. Now that Danes are primarily companion animals, cropping is sometimes still done for traditional and cosmetic reasons. In the 1930s when Great Danes had their ears cropped, after the surgery, two devices called Easter bonnets were fitted to their ears to make them stand up. Today, the practice is common in the United States, but much less common in Europe. In some European countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, and Germany, and parts of Australia and New Zealand, the practice is banned or controlled to only be performed by veterinary surgeons.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\n\nThe three varieties have five to six (depending on the standard) show-acceptable coat colors:\nFawn and brindle\nFawn: The colour is yellow gold with a black mask. Black should appear on the eye rims and eyebrows, and may appear on the ears.\nBrindle: The colour is fawn and black in a chevron stripe pattern. Often, also, they are referred to as having a stripe pattern.\nHarlequin and black\nBlack: The colour is a glossy black. White markings on the chest and toes are not desirable and considered faults.\nHarlequin: The base colour is pure white with black torn patches irregularly and well distributed over the entire body; a pure white neck is preferred. The black patches should never be large enough to give the appearance of a blanket, nor so small as to give a stippled or dappled effect. Eligible, but less desirable, are a few small grey patches (this grey is consistent with a merle marking) or a white base with single black hairs showing through, which tend to give a salt and pepper or dirty effect.Grey merle (Grautiger) dogs are acceptable in conformation shows under the FCI as the grey merle dogs can produce correctly marked black/white harlequin dogs, depending on the combinations. The aim for deleting the colour grey merle as a disqualifying fault is to provide a wider gene pool. Their status is that they are \"neither desirable nor to be disqualified\". Consequently, this colour must never obtain the highest grading at dog shows.\nMantle (in some countries referred to as Bostons due to the similar coloration and pattern as a Boston Terrier): The colour is black and white with a solid black blanket extending over the body; black skull with white muzzle; white blaze is optional; whole white collar preferred; a white chest; white on part or whole of forelegs and hind legs; white tipped black tail. A small white marking in the black blanket is acceptable, as is a break in the white collar.\nBlue: The colour is a pure steel blue. White markings at the chest and toes are not desirable and considered faults.Other colours occur occasionally, but are not acceptable for conformation showing, and they are not pursued by breeders who intend to breed show dogs. These colours include white, fawnequin, brindlequin, merle, merlequin, blue merle, chocolate and fawn mantle. The white Great Dane coloring is typically associated with vision and hearing impairment.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Great Dane's large and imposing appearance belies its friendly nature. They are known for seeking physical affection with their owners, and the breed is often referred to as a \"gentle giant\".Great Danes are generally well disposed toward other dogs, other noncanine pets, and familiar humans. They generally do not exhibit extreme aggressiveness or a high prey drive. The Great Dane is a very gentle and loving animal and with the proper care and training is great around children, especially when being raised with them. However, if not properly socialized, a Great Dane may become fearful or aggressive towards new stimuli, such as strangers and new environments. The Great Dane, although large in size, is comfortable and well-suited to life in a small apartment, or a large house with acres of land.  The Great Dane is a very adaptable breed, known for being \"couch potatoes\".\nGreat Danes are a breed recommended for families provided that they get trained early and onwards, regarded by animal experts due to their preference for sitting on and leaning against owners as \"the world's biggest 'lapdog'.\"\n\n\n== Exercise ==\nLike most dogs, Great Danes require daily walks to maintain their health. However, it is important not to over exercise this breed, particularly when young. Great Dane puppies grow very large, very fast, which puts them at risk of joint and bone problems. Because of a puppy's natural energy, Dane owners often take steps to minimize activity while the dog is still growing.Given their large size, Great Danes continue to grow (mostly gaining weight) longer than most dogs. Even at one year of age, a Great Dane continues to grow for several more months.\n\n\n== Health ==\nGreat Danes, like most giant dogs, have a fairly slow metabolism. This results in less energy and less food consumption per pound of dog than in small breeds. They have some health problems that are common to large breeds, including bloat (gastric dilatation volvulus). To avoid bloat, a rest period of 40 minutes to one hour after meals is recommended before exercise. \nTheir average lifespan is 6 to 8 years; however, some Great Danes have been known to reach 10 years of age or more. Like many larger breeds, Great Danes are at particular risk for hip dysplasia.\nDilated cardiomyopathy  and many congenital heart diseases are also commonly found in the Great Dane, leading to its nickname: the heartbreak breed, in conjunction with its shorter lifespan. Great Danes also may carry the merle gene, which is part of the genetic makeup that creates the harlequin coloring. The merle gene is an incomplete dominant, meaning only one copy of the gene is needed to show the merle coloring; two merle genes produce excessive white markings and many health issues such as deafness, blindness, or other debilitating ocular issues. Great Danes can also develop wobbler disease, a condition affecting the vertebral column. Since these dogs do grow at a rapid rate, the bones in their vertebae can push up against the spinal cord and cause weakness in the legs. This can be treated with surgery or may heal itself over time.\n\n\n== Cultural significance ==\nAnimationAnimation designer Iwao Takamoto based the Hanna-Barbera character Scooby-Doo on a Great Dane. He derived his design from sketches given to him by a Hanna-Barbera employee who bred Danes and then endeavoured to make Scooby the opposite of a perfect pedigree, with a longer tail, bowed legs, small chin and sloping back.\nElmer, a Great Dane in Oswald the Lucky Rabbit by Walter LantzBooksIn the Harry Potter novels, Fang is said to be a Great Dane.

It should not be confused with the Pyrenean Mastiff.\nAs late as 1874 the breed was not completely standardized in appearance, with two major sub-types recorded, the Western and the Eastern. They are related to several other large white European livestock guardian dogs (LGD), including the Italian Maremma Sheepdog, Kuvasz (Hungary), Akbash Dog (Turkey) and Polish Tatra or Polski Owczarek Podhala\u0144ski, and somewhat less closely to the Newfoundland and St. Bernard. According to the Great Pyrenees Club of America, the Great Pyrenees is naturally nocturnal and aggressive with any predators that may harm its flock.  However, the breed can typically be trusted with small, young, and helpless animals of any kind due to its natural guardian instinct.The Great Pyrenees breed has experienced a dramatic fall-off in the number of U.S. AKC breed registrations from 2000 to 2010.  The breed was ranked at #45 in 2000 and by 2010 Great Pyrenees had dropped to #71. In 2013 the breed was ranked #69. Other large breeds in the same working group classification, Newfoundland and St. Bernard, have fared far better in maintaining their breed rankings. In 2010 the Newfoundland and St. Bernard were ranked #44 and #45 respectively.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nMales grow to 110\u2013130 pounds (50\u201359 kg) and 27\u201332 inches (69\u201381 cm), while females reach 90\u2013115 pounds (41\u201352 kg) and 26\u201331 inches (66\u201379 cm). On average, their lifespan is 10 to 11 years.The weather-resistant double coat consists of a long, flat, thick, outer coat of coarse hair, straight or slightly undulating, and lying over a dense, fine, woolly undercoat. The coat is more profuse about the neck and shoulders where it forms a ruff or mane, which is more pronounced in males so that it may fend off wolf attacks. The longer hair on the tail forms a plume. There is also feathering along the back of the front legs and along the back of the thighs, giving a \"pantaloon\" effect. The hair on the face and ears is both shorter and of finer texture.\n\nThe main coat color is white and can have varying shades of gray, red (rust), or tan around the face (including a full face mask), ears and sometimes on the body and tail. As Great Pyrenees mature, their coats grow thicker and the longer colored hair of the coat often fades. Sometimes a little light tan or lemon will appear later in life around the ears and face. Being a double-coated breed, the undercoat can also have color and the skin as well. The color of the nose and on the eye rims should be jet black. Grey or tan markings that remain lend the French name, \"blaireau\", (badger) which is a similar grizzled mixture color seen in the European badger. More recently, any color is correctly termed \"Badger\" or \"Blaireau\".One singular characteristic of the Great Pyrenees is the unique double dewclaws on each hind leg.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nIn nature, the Great Pyrenees is confident, gentle (especially with children), and affectionate. While territorial and protective of its flock or family when necessary, its general demeanor is of composure and patience and loyalty. It is a strong-willed, independent and reserved breed.  It is also attentive, quite fearless and loyal to its duties.  The Great Pyrenees' size makes it an imposing guardian.  A dog of this breed will patrol its perimeter and may wander away if left off its leash in an unenclosed space.  The Great Pyrenees protects its flock by barking, and, being nocturnal, tends to bark at night unless trained against such behavior.The Great Pyrenees can be slow to learn new commands, slow to obey, and somewhat stubborn to train.  For this reason, the breed is ranked #64 (out of 79 ranks covering 131 breeds) in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs. Despite this relative stubbornness, it is quite unusual for the Great Pyrenees to become aggressive or turn on its master. It is wary of strangers if the person is not allowed in the house, but will settle down if the owner of the dog seems comfortable with the stranger.  This dog was originally bred to be a livestock guard dog, and can still be found doing that job on farms and ranches.\n\n\n=== Upkeep ===\nWhen kept as a house pet, the Great Pyrenees' coat needs brushing once or twice a week. The breed needs moderate exercise but tends to be somewhat lazy, especially in warm weather. They particularly enjoy cold weather and snow. Like similar breeds, some Great Pyrenees tend to drool, especially with exercise, heat or stress.  However, this is not on a Beethoven like scale, and generally, they are not droolers. Great Pyrenees need to have their nails clipped often to avoid damage. This breed also needs to have their teeth and ears cleaned regularly to prevent infection. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe Great Pyrenees is a very old breed that has been used for hundreds of years by shepherds, including those of the Basque people, who inhabit parts of the region in and around the Pyrenees Mountains of southern France and northern Spain (specifically Aragon and Navarre).Varro, a Roman author who lived in the first century BC, wrote in his treatise of rural economy \"De re rustica\" in 37 BC.:\n\"The dog is essential for those who raise animals for wool. It is the guardian of livestock in general but is the natural defender of the sheep and goats. The wolf lurks constantly and we oppose it with the dogs\"... \"As for its appearance, choose those who are well-trained, large size, with black or red eyes, the nose of the same color, red lips pulling to black, not too collected, nor too pendants\"... \"It is equally essential that the dogs have strong head, long, floppy ears, wide and short neck, thighs and rights more inwardly turned than out, wide legs, fingers apart, hard nails and bent, spine nor projection nor convex, bushy tail, sonorous voice, good match muzzle and preferably with white hair so that it can be easily distinguished from wild animals at night.\"\n\nOne of the first descriptions of the breed dates from 1407, Fray Miguel Agust\u00edn, \"prior\" of the Temple who lived between 1560 and 1630, published in 1617 in Catalan (the first edition appeared in Spanish in 1622), a book which he called Libro de los secretos de la agricultura, casa de campo y pastoril. It gives the reasons why shepherds prefer white puppies, excluding those born with spots of dark color. Relates the friar: \"The wool cattle dogs should not must be so big or so heavy as those of the guard of the house, but strong and sturdy, lightweight and ready to combat and fight and for run, because they have to make saves and guard against wolves and hunt them down if those take a cattle... These should be white so that the shepherd can easily see when these run after the wolf and know them in the evening and the morning.\"From 1675 the breed was a favorite of The Grand Dauphin and other members of the French aristocracy.In the mid-19th century, the breed was not homogenized. According to the article published on February 20, 1874, in the journal \"Acclimatization\" and written by the canine expert Kermadec, says:\n\"There in the Pyrenees various types of large dogs, called Mountain Dogs, and among other, two very different varieties:\n-One, We might designate with the name \"Dog of the Western Pyrenees,\" particularly widespread around Bagneres-de-Bigorre; have a thick snout, hanging lips, rounded ears, a little curly coat black and white, seems to be largely the strain of large dogs designated with the name Terra-Nova Dogs, widespread throughout France.\n-The Second type is the \"Dog of the Eastern Pyrenees\" is large, very slender shape, pointed snout, pointy ears and falls, soft, silky and abundant coat, a complete white snow color. In some cases, there is a blackish band around the eyes, but often it is completely white... It was extended once in the Republic of Andorra and part of Spain, but in Andorra is completely extirpated. It might still exist in the mountains of Spain.\"\n\n\n=== Spread ===\nIt is possible that Venezuelan Mucuchies breed descend from the Great Pyrenees, other Spanish breeds, and other few more breeds, that could be introduced in 16th century by Spanish conquistadors.The real spread of the Great Pyrenees out of its mountains developed in the 19th century with the birth of Romanticism. This breed, first appreciated for its beauty and poise, and then by its innate temperamental qualities, gained fame in the rest of Europe. The Great Pyrenees were introduced in America by General Lafayette in 1824. In Australia they were introduced in 1843 to save herds on a farm in Hamilton.\nBy the early 19th century there was a thriving market for the dogs in mountain towns, from which they would be taken to other parts of France. The dog was developed to be agile in order to guard sheep on steep, mountainous slopes.The breed is said to be part of the mix that was used to create the Leonberger.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nBelle, from C\u00e9cile Aubry's Belle et S\u00e9bastien novel is a Great Pyrenees.\nThe 2004 film Finding Neverland used a Great Pyrenees to represent J.

The name Sennenhund refers to people called Senn or Senner, dairymen and herders in the Swiss Alps. Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are almost certainly the result of indigenous dogs mating with large mastiff types brought to Switzerland by foreign settlers. At one time, the breed was believed to have been among the most popular in Switzerland. It was assumed to have almost died out by the late 19th century, since its work was being done by other breeds or machines, but was rediscovered in the early 1900s.The breed is large and heavy-boned with great physical strength, but is still agile enough to perform the all-purpose farm duties it was originally used for. Its breed standard calls for a black, white, and rust colored coat.\nThe Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is sociable, active, and calm. It is relatively healthy for its size and tends to have far fewer problems than more popular breeds in its size range. Among the four Sennenhunde, or Swiss mountain dogs, this breed is considered the oldest, and is also the largest.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Breed history ===\n\nThe origin of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is not definitively known. The Swiss people themselves cannot be clearly defined as belonging exclusively to one of the European tribes; they are inhabitants of a typical transit country. Beginning in 1515, the remote valleys of Switzerland were more or less isolated from world history for three centuries. Specific dog breeds were created by inbreeding, and puppies were given to neighbors and family members.There are several theories regarding the origin of the four Sennenhund breeds. The most popular theory states the dogs are descended from the Molosser, a large Mastiff-type dog, which accompanied the Roman Legions on their invasion of the Alps more than 2000 years ago.A second theory is that in 1100 BC, the Phoenicians brought a large dog breed with them to settlements in Spain. These dogs later migrated eastward and influenced the development of the Spanish Mastiff, Great Pyrenees, Dogue de Bordeaux, and Sennenhund breeds.A third possibility is that a large dog breed was indigenous to central Europe during the Neolithic Period, when humans grew wild and domestic crops and used domesticated animals. Whether or not a domesticated large breed existed in the Alpine area when the Romans invaded, Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are almost certainly the result of the mating of native farm dogs with large Mastiff-type dogs brought to Switzerland by foreign settlers. The early ancestors of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog were used by farmers, herdsmen and merchants in central Europe. The breed was bred as a draught dog to pull heavy carts, to guard and move dairy cattle, and as a watchdog and family companion.\n\n\n=== Selective breeding ===\n\nSelective breeding was based on a dog's ability to perform a particular function, such as pulling loads or guarding. The Swiss farmer needed a strong, multi-purpose dog capable of contributing to daily life on the farm. Large, sturdy and confident, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a draft and drover breed that is robust and agile enough to perform farm work in very mountainous regions. The breed was also used as a butcher's dog, having been \"popular with butchers, cattle dealers, manual workers and farmers, who used them as guard dogs, droving or draught dogs and bred them as such.\" Its popularity as a draft dog led to the nickname \"the poor man's horse\". By the 19th century, the ancestors of the modern Greater Swiss Mountain Dog were widely used in central Europe by farmers and tradesmen.\n\n\n=== Renewal of breed ===\n\n\n==== Prevailing theory ====\n\nAt one time, the breed's ancestors were believed to have been among the most popular dogs in Switzerland. It was assumed that the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog had almost died out by the late 19th century, because their work was being done by other breeds or machines, but they were rediscovered in the early 1900s.In 1908, on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Swiss Kennel Club (Schweizerische Kynologische Gesellschaft or SKG), two short-haired Bernese Mountain Dogs were shown by Franz Schertenlieb to an advocate of the Swiss mountain dogs, geology professor Albert Heim (April 12, 1849 \u2013 August 31, 1937). Heim recognized them as representatives of the old, vanishing, large mountain dog, whose ancestors had been widely spread across Europe, and bred as guard dogs, draft dogs, and droving-cattle dogs.Heim was a Sennenhund expert, and started to encourage breeders to take an interest in them. These efforts resulted in the re-establishment of the breed. In 1909, the dogs were recognized as a separate breed by the Swiss Kennel Club and entered as \"Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund\" in Volume 12 of the Swiss stud book. The first breed club was formed in 1912 to promote the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. The Bernese Mountain Dog and the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog are two of four distinctive farm-type dogs of Swiss origin who were saved from extinction and revitalized by Schertenlieb in the late 1800s.\n\n\n==== Secondary theory ====\nThere is little information about the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog written before 1907. Until 1913, it was only mentioned in reports by exhibition judges, such as Dr. Albert Heim, who is credited with introducing them into official dog breeding. Heim was sure that the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog was the most widely kept dog in the mountain areas of Switzerland between 1860 and 1870, but the prevailing theory asserts that within 30 years, it had nearly disappeared. Dr. Hans Raber commented on this discrepancy in his book, Die Schweizer Hunderassen:\n\nIf this dog was commonly kept around 1870, it is unbelievable that only 30 years later you could only find him in remote valleys in the Bern area. A well known and working dog cannot disappear in such a short time, especially not if he had all the good qualities he is credited with. Furthermore, this dog was not limited to Switzerland. He also was known in southern Germany, where today the Rottweiler is his noble successor, and in other areas.\n\nThis theory asserts that systematic breeding did not occur. Farmers did not typically take their in-season females to selected males, so breeding was left to chance. From the litter, puppies who were likable and looked suitable were chosen. Because of this strict selection, and because puppies were often kept in their original neighborhood, the appearance and character of the dogs remained stable. Practical matters were important when selecting the dog and dictated appearance. It isn't known how much attention was given to colors, but it is possible that irregularly or asymmetrically marked dogs were considered less desirable.Although Heim has said that the big butcher dogs, Metzgerhund, became extinct after foreign imports became more popular, there is speculation over whether farmers would get an expensive foreign dog. In 1889 an International Dog Show was held in Winterthur, northern Switzerland; various Sennenhunde were exhibited. Raber is sure the dogs were present in 1900 as draft dogs for peddlers and people going to market, watch dogs for farmers and drover\u2019s dog for butchers; they were rarely tri-colored. Everywhere the dogs had short, rough coats; nearly all were brown, yellow or black with white and brown markings. Lons' description of the northern and central German butcher dog also fits the Sennenhunde at the beginning of pure breeding; this applies to the Austrian butcher dog of Linz, and the French and Belgian Matin. It is to their credit that Heim and Schertenleib selected one variation of the butcher dog \u2013 possible the most beautiful \u2013 and started it on the road to a pure breed.\n\nIn 1908 the Swiss mountain dog appeared for the first time in public. At a show in Langenthal, Switzerland, Franz Schertenleib \u2013 a breeder of the Berner \u2013 showed an extraordinarily strong, short-haired Berner Sennenhund. He had seen this dog and bought him as an oddity. He was eager to hear what the Langenthal judge, Professor Heim, would say about this short-haired Berner. Bello vom Schlossgut was beautifully marked, 26 in (66 cm) high, sturdy, and with attractive colors. Heim's first look saw the possibility of a new breed of Sennenhunde. He remembered having seen similar dogs in the 1860s in various parts of Switzerland. He said to Schertenleib, \"The dog belongs in a different category; he is too gorgeous and thoroughbred to push him aside as a poor example of a Berner. He is an example of the old-time, almost extinct, butcher dog.\" Heim wrote in his judge\u2019s notes: \"Bello is a marvelous, old Sennen (Butcher) hund of the large, almost extinct breed. Had he been entered under \"other breeds\" I would have recognized him as grossen Sennenhund and awarded him first prize with pleasure. Since he was entered among the Durrbachs, I cannot give this interesting dog more than second prize. This dog is out of place here.\"Heim gave Bello the name Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund and dismissed the first representative of a newly named breed from the ring. Heim wrote the first standard based on Bello, and Schertenleib started to search for other members of the new breed. He found two short-haired bitches and breeding began. The first Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs were stockier and rougher than the modern dogs; the skulls were wider than desirable today and showed a marked stop. Judging from old pictures, the coloring was bad; the black coat was mixed with yellow wool at the neck, flanks and rear.\n\n\n=== 20th century development ===\nThroughout the early 20th century, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog population in Europe grew slowly, and it remains a rare breed both in its native Switzerland and the U.S. During World War II the breed was used by the Swiss Army as a draft dog. In 1945 over 100 puppies were registered, indicating the existence of about 350\u2013400 dogs of the breed at that time.The breed was first recognised internationally in 1939, when the Swiss Standard was first published by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale. In 1968 J. Frederick and Patricia Hoffman imported the first Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs to the U.S. The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Club of America was formed; the club promotes careful, selective breeding to gradually increase the strength and popularity of the breed. In 1983 the club held the first Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Club of America (GSMDCA) National Specialty; the club registry contained 257 dogs. In 1985 the breed was granted entrance to the American Kennel Club (AKC) Miscellaneous Group. In 1992 the GSMDCA started to work toward full  AKC recognition, and in July 1995 the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog was officially granted full recognition in the AKC Working Group.Oscar The Grouch, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog was featured in the front page of the Wall Street Journal  as he prepared to compete at the Westminster dog show. According to the AKC, Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are 88th in popularity as a breed.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a draft and drover breed; it is a large, heavy-boned dog with incredible physical strength. Despite being heavy-boned and well-muscled, the dog is agile enough to perform the all-purpose farm duties of the mountainous regions of its origin.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\n\nThere is black on top of the dog's back, ears, tail and the majority of the legs. There should be rust on the cheeks, a thumb print above the eyes, and also rust should appear on the legs between the white and black. There should be white on the muzzle, the feet, the tip of the tail, on the chest, and up from the muzzle to pass between the eyes. Symmetrical markings are preferred by breeders.\nThe double coat has a dense outer coat of about 1.25 to 2 in (3.2 to 5.1 cm) long. Textures of the topcoat can range from short, straight and fine to longer, wavier and coarser. The under coat is thick and ranges from the preferred dark gray to light gray to tawny, and must be on the neck, but can be all over the body \u2013 with such a thick coat, Sennenhunde shed throughout the year and they have a major shedding once or twice a year.While the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Standard calls for a black, white and rust dog; they do come in other colors which include blue, white and tan tri-color; and rust and white bi-color. On the blue tri-color dogs, blue replaces where black would be and tan replaces where the rust would normally be. On the rust bi-color dogs, the dog is solid rust and white markings with a total absence of black coloring.\n\n\n=== Size ===\nMales range between 25.5 to 28.5 in (65 to 72 cm) at the shoulder and females range between 23.5 to 27 in (60 to 69 cm) at the shoulder. There is no standard for weight in the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog; males tend to range between 120 to 155 lb (54 to 70 kg) and females range between 100 to 115 lb (45 to 52 kg). Body length to height is approximately a 10 to 9 proportion; they are slightly longer than tall.\n\n\n=== Conformation ===\n\n\n==== Head ====\nGreater Swiss Mountain Dogs have an animated and gentle expression. Their eyes are almond shaped, vary in color from hazel to chestnut \u2013 dark brown is preferred \u2013 medium-sized, and neither deep set nor protruding. Eyelids are close fitting and eyerims are black.The medium-sized ears are set high, triangular in shape, gently rounded at the tip and hang close to the head when relaxed. When alert, the ears are brought forward and raised at the base. The top of the ear is level with the top of the skull.The skull is flat and broad with a slight stop. The backskull and muzzle are approximately equal in length; the backskull is approximately twice the width of the muzzle. The muzzle is large, blunt and straight, and most often has a slight rise before the end. In adult dogs the nose leather is always black.The lips are clean and as a dry-mouthed breed, flews are only slightly developed. They should not drool. The teeth meet in a scissors bite.\n\n\n==== Neck, topline and body ====\n\nThe neck is of moderate length, strong, muscular and clean. The topline is level from the withers to the croup \u2013 the croup is the fused sacral vertebrae that form the roof of the pelvis and the first few vertebrae of the tail. The croup is long, broad and smoothly rounded to the tail insertion. The tail is thicker at the base, tapering to a point as it reaches the hocks; it is carried down in repose. When alert and in movement, the tail may be carried higher and curved slightly upward; it should not curl over the back. The bones of the tail should be straight.The chest is deep and broad with a slightly protruding breastbone, with well-sprung ribs. The depth of the chest is approximately one-half the height of the dog at the withers, and the deepest point of the chest should lie between the elbows, not above them.\n\n\n==== Forequarters ====\nThe shoulders of a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog are long, sloping, strong, moderately laid back, flat and well-muscled. Their forelegs are straight and strong.A dog walks on its toes like a horse does; a dog's pastern and paws are analogous to the back of a human's hand and fingers, respectively. The pasterns slope very slightly, but are not weak. Feet are round and compact with well-arched toes; the feet turn neither in nor out.\n\n\n==== Hindquarters ====\nThe thighs are broad, strong and muscular; broad, strong and muscular hindquarters, and proper angles between the stifles and hocks are essential for a draft dog to provide powerful rear-drive during movement. The breed standard 'bend of stifle' refers to where the upper and the lower thighs meet. The stifles are moderately bent and taper smoothly into the hocks. The hocks are well let down and straight when viewed from the rear. The hock joint corresponds to the human ankle and first short bones in the foot; the dog does not walk on the heel as people do. Feet are round and compact with well-arched toes; they turn neither in nor out. Dewclaws should be removed.\n\n\n==== Gait ====\nThe gait of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog should have movement with a level back. Their gait should have good reach in front with a powerful drive in the rear. Soundness, balance and efficiency which accompany correct structure and good condition are crucial factors in their movement, not speed. Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs were bred to work all day on a farm and need stamina. They are a large breed; because of their history as farm dogs in mountainous terrain, they are extremely agile and this is apparent in their gait.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is happy with an enthusiastic nature and strong affinity to people and children. This breed is sociable, active, calm and dignified. They do need plenty of room to exercise. They will not be happy confined to kennel life; they want to enjoy their family. They crave attention and physical contact. Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are bold, faithful and willing workers and are  eager to please. The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is confident in nature; the breed is gentle with children. They can be stubborn and determined. The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is an intelligent breed and is a quick learner. They can be difficult to housebreak, taking up to 6 months or more; and tend to try to eat just about anything, edible or not.The activity level in the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is variable. They are capable of being athletic, but usually that activity is in bursts; they are active for short periods of time followed by napping. They want to be with their owners and to participate; their activity level most often matches the activity level of the family. As a working dog, they like having a job to do and enjoy participating in hiking, carting, obedience trials, herding, weight pulling and backpacking with their owners.Being alert and vigilant, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a good watchdog. They tend to notice everything in their surroundings and are quick to sound alarm. Faced with a threat, they will stand their ground and put on a show that will intimidate those unfamiliar with the dog. Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are accepting of a non-threatening stranger. They are confident and comfortable in unfamiliar locations, and are stable around strange noises and unfamiliar people. They are accepting of other dogs and species, and are reluctant to bite.This giant breed matures slowly in both mind and body, taking anywhere from 2 to 3 years. The objective in training this dog is for the owner to build trust through humane methods. As youngsters, they can be quite boisterous and they do require steady and reliable training to develop manners and physical self-control. As with all large, active working dogs, this breed should be well socialized early in life with other dogs and people, and be provided with regular activity and training.\n\n\n== Health ==\nFor the most part, this breed is relatively healthy for their size; Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs have far fewer problems than more populous breeds in the similar size range.\n\n\n=== Urinary incontinence ===\nUrinary incontinence (UI) is defined as involuntary urination, and most often occurs in Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs as leaking of urine while sleeping; it is a non-life-threatening condition. It seems that more than 20% of the females are affected, usually after being spayed. Incontinence is occasionally found in males as well. Incontinence can occur for many reasons, such as a weak bladder sphincter \u2013 generally the most common cause in Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs \u2013 urinary tract infection, excessive water consumption, congenital structural defects and spinal cord disease.\n\n\n=== Eyelash issues ===\nThe two most common eye issues that Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs face are distichiasis and entropion, with distichiasis being the most common issue. Distichiasis is the presence of extra eyelashes along the eyelid. Distichiasis has been reported in 19%, of the breed and in the vast majority of cases it is non-symptomatic and does not cause an issue for the dog. Extra eyelashes can be seen along the eyelid; sometimes extra eyelashes grow so that they irritate the eye.  Treatment varies from vet to vet, some choosing to freeze the affected hair follicles and others choosing to use electrocautery.Entropion, found in about 3% of the breed, is the rolling in of the eyelids, which causes the eyelashes to irritate the eye. Entropion is a condition that often requires surgery to fix, but once corrected causes no future issues for the dog.\n\n\n=== Lick fit ===\nLick fit is the frantic licking in which Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs can be prone. This has been reported in 17% of the breed. When in the middle of a lick fit, the dog will lick anything they can \u2014 carpet, floors, walls \u2014 and will eat anything they can find, including grass, leaves, dirt, carpet, and will gulp air and swallow constantly. Their actions make it obvious they are in severe gastrointestinal discomfort. Many owners are able to prevent lick fits by ensuring the dog never has an empty stomach by frequent, smaller meals and large dog biscuits as between meal snacks.\n\n\n=== Epilepsy ===\nIdiopathic epilepsy (IE) is the condition of frequent seizures with no identifiable cause. Seizures occur when nerve cells in the brain become hyperexcited and send rapid-fire messages to the body. Treatment of IE depends on the severity of the case and may involve daily administration of anticonvulsant drugs. IE is present in all Greater Swiss Mountain Dog lines; it typically surfaces between the ages of 1 to 3 years, but it can become evident as early as 12 months and as late as 5 years.\n\n\n=== Abdominal health issues ===\nGastric dilatation volvulus (GDV), also known as bloat, is the greatest killer of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. GDV occurs in deep-chested breeds and requires immediate veterinary care. It can be caused by wolfing down too much water, too much food too fast, exercise after eating, stress or unknown conditions. Symptoms are distended abdomen, excessive salivating, depression and lethargy. When GDV occurs it cuts off the esophagus, and blood supply to the heart is lessened causing low blood pressure as well as other cardiac problems; the dog can go into shock. Organ damage can occur as well and the stomach may rupture causing peritonitis to set in. If not treated, the dog may die.The spleen is located in the left cranial abdomen and is held loosely in place by ligaments. Primary diseases of the spleen are splenic torsion and splenic tumors. Splenic torsion occurs when the spleen twists along the axis of the blood supply. Symptoms of splenic torsion include lethargy, abdominal distension and pale mucous membranes. One theory for the development of splenic torsion is that for dogs with chronic intermittent gastric dilatation, the dilation causes the spleen's ligaments to stretch and increases the spleen\u2019s mobility within the abdomen. The spleen becomes torsed because it is no longer anchored in its correct location. In a normal Greater Swiss Mountain Dog the spleen is smooth and uncreased; it is about 6 to 8 in (15 to 20 cm) by 2 in (5.1 cm), and less than 1 in (2.5 cm) thick. Most of the spleens removed from Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are 18 to 24 in (46 to 61 cm) by 8 to 10 in (20 to 25 cm) and very thick. This size spleen is not an abnormal finding in this breed. It seems apparent that many dogs of the breed suffer enlarged spleens for no obvious reason other than the spleen may have been constantly twisting, folding and unfolding.\n\n\n=== Dysplasias ===\nCanine hip dysplasia (CHD) is the irregular formation of the joint that joins the femur \u2013 the longest bone in the body \u2013 to the hip socket. The hip is a ball-and-socket joint and the femoral head must fit well into the socket for the joint to function properly. Early signs of CHD include a reluctance to go up and down stairs or to jump; difficulty rising or lying down; and bunny hopping when running \u2013 both hind limbs move together. CHD is among the principal orthopedic diseases in the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog; it is rarely severe and crippling. Unless x-rays are taken many owners are not aware that they have a dysplastic dog. A goal for raising a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog from puppyhood is to feed them so they mature more slowly than smaller breeds to help avoid hip and other orthopedic problems in adulthood.The form of Canine Elbow dysplasia most often diagnosed in Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs appears to be a degerative joint disease \u2013 a slowly progressive form of cartilage degeneration usually caused by trauma or abnormal wear on the joint. Evidence suggests that most dogs of this breed diagnosed with degenerative joint disease by x-rays of the elbows have the mildest form Grade I. They don't display clinical signs such as pain, stiffness, decreased range of motion or lameness.Osteochondrosis is a disturbance in the normal development of cartilage; cartilage becomes abnormally thickened, and small fissures and cracks may develop. Dissecans is when cartilage becomes dissected resulting in cartilage flaps, which may remain attached or become loose and fall into the joint space. In Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs most of these cases occur in the shoulder joints and occasionally in elbows and hocks. Except for very mild cases without flap development, the clinical signs are persistent or intermittent lameness. The dog may be stiff after resting and the lameness is usually aggravated by exercise. It is diagnosed by x-rays, and treatment depends on the severity of the case. Mild cases without cartilage flaps may be treated and heal with several weeks of rest and treatment with medication and supplements. Many cases require surgery to remove the flaps and loose fragments, and scraping and smoothing of the defective surface. Surgical repair of the shoulder usually has excellent results, surgical results involving other sites are not as predictable.\n\n\n=== Rage Syndrome ===\nSudden Onset Aggression (SOA) or Rage Syndrome has been reported in Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs.\n\n\n== Lifespan ==\nHeavier dogs such as the Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs tend to have shorter lifespans than medium- and small-sized dogs; longevity is inversely related to breed size. Two websites list the life expectancy for Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs at 10 to 11 years; another lists it as 8\u201310 years. A survey by the US breed club shows a median lifespan of 6.75 years. Dog lifespans may vary in different countries, even in the same breed.\n\n\n== Kennel club and pet registry recognition ==\nThe Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund, or Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, is recognised internationally by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI). They are in Group 2, Section 3 Swiss Mountain and Cattle Dogs; standards are dated March 25, 2003. The first standard was published not before February 5, 1939.\nThe American Kennel Club (AKC) fully recognized the breed in 1995, and classifies them in the Working Group.\nThe Canadian Kennel Club recognized the breed in 2006, and also places the breed in the Working Group.\nThe United Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1992; they place the breed in the Guardian Dog Group.\nThe Kennel Club, based in the United Kingdom, classifies the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog in the Working Group.\nThe Continental Kennel Club (CKC) lists the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog and provides minimal information about the breed.\nThe America's Pet Registry Inc. (APRI) does have a classified ad section for Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs.\nThe American Canine Registry (ACR) lists the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog as an acceptable breed under their American Canine Registry section.\nAs of May 2010 the breed is not recognised by the New Zealand Kennel Club or the Australian National Kennel Council.\n\n\n== Four breeds of Sennenhund ==\n\nThe Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is considered the oldest of the Swiss breeds. It is the largest of the four Sennenhund breeds; all four have the same colors and markings but are different sizes.\nEvolutionary hierarchy suggests breeds should genetically cluster into groups sharing recent common ancestry. A genetic clustering algorithm could not easily distinguish between the obviously related pairs of Greater Swiss Mountain Dog and the Bernese Mountain Dog.The four breeds of Sennenhund, with the original breed name followed by the most popular English version of the breed name, and their size:\n\nGrosser Schweizer Sennenhund, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. Males range between 25.5 to 28.5 inches (65 to 72 cm) at the shoulder and females range between 23.5 to 27 in (60 to 69 cm) at the shoulder. There is no standard for weight in the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog; males tend to weigh between 100 to 140 lb (45 to 64 kg) and females weigh between 80 to 115 lb (36 to 52 kg).\nBerner Sennenhund, Bernese Mountain Dog. This is the only one of the four with a long coat; it is the second-largest with males at 25 to 27.5 in (64 to 70 cm) high and 90 to 130 lb (41 to 59 kg). Females are 23 to 26 in (58 to 66 cm) tall and weigh 75 to 100 lb (34 to 45 kg).\nAppenzeller Sennenhund, Appenzeller\nEntlebucher Sennenhund, Entlebucher Mountain Dog. Males are 17 to 21 in (43 to 53 cm) tall, and females are 16 to 20 in (41 to 51 cm).\n\n\n== Similar breeds ==\nIn addition to the three breeds mentioned in the previous section, Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are related to other mountain dogs: Boxers, Bullmastiffs, Doberman Pinschers, Great Danes, Great Pyrenees, Komondors, Kuvaszes and Mastiffs. The breed probably contributed to the development of the St. Bernard and the Rottweiler.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCarting\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGreater Swiss Mountain Dog at Curlie\nHistorical photos of the Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund from the Bern Naturaidogsarebad History Museum\nMore information about geologist and indigenous Swiss dog breeds advocate Albert Heim (1849-1937), including a photo with Swiss Mountain Dogs in 1929 (in German)"}, {"id": 229, "name": "Greek Harehound", "country": "Greece", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog229", "description": "The Greek Harehound (Greek: \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u0399\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2; FCI No. 214) is a rare breed of dog that only comes in a black and tan color, originally bred as a scent hound for tracking and chasing hare in Southern Greece.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Greek Harehound is a scent hound with a shorthaired black and tan coat. It is a medium-sized dog, weighing between 17\u201320 kg (37\u201344 lb). Males and females should have a height of 47\u201355 cm (19\u201322 in) and 45\u201353 cm (18\u201321 in) at the withers respectively.\nHead: The skull, which is relatively flat, is the same or slightly shorter than the muzzle's length. Its forehead is generally broad.\nJaws: The Greek Harehound has powerful jaws. Its teeth should either be in a scissor or pincer bite and evenly spaced.\nEyes: This breed possess bright brown-colored eyes that are medium-sized. The eyes should neither be set too deep or bulging.\nEars: The ears are set high, and should hang down halfway along the head.\nCoat: The Greek Harehound has a short, dense coat that has a slightly hard texture. Its coat is usually only black and tan in color, yet a small white patch may be present in some individuals. No trimming or stripping is required.\nTail: The tail's length should not exceed the point of the hock. It is set high, thick at the base and tapering by a little at the tip.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Greek Harehound has a lively, confident and outgoing temperament. These dogs are skilled, fearless hunters, and have a keen sense of smell as well as excellent strength and stamina. Their activity level is high and require regular physical stimulation and a large space to exercise. The Greek Harehound is also devoted to its owner, and generally makes a fine family pet, although they are better with older children. Since the Greek Harehound was originally bred to hunt in packs, it is placid with other dogs, yet they may be wary and suspicious around strangers.\nLike other scent hound breeds, the Greek Harehound is independent and strong-willed at times. Males in particular require a confident owner to be in charge. These dogs can also be stubborn and impatient at times, so they should be trained at an early age. Positive reinforcements and proper discipline is necessary when training a Greek Harehound and rough handling should be avoided. Due to their original hunting purposes, the Greek Harehound is vocal and extremely loud, and may enjoy chasing small animals and moving things. They may also show destructiveness when bored or left alone for a prolonged period of time.\nOverall speaking, these dogs can be challenging to train and are not recommended for the inexperienced dog owner as well as apartment life. They are more suitable as hunting dogs than house pets.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Greek Harehound is a healthy breed with no known genetic defects. But like other dogs with pendulous ears, their ears are more prone to infections and need to be cleaned frequently. Their life span is around eleven years.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlopekis\nCretan Hound\nGreek Shepherd\nKokoni Domestic Dog\nList of dog breeds\nKennel Club of Greece\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 230, "name": "Greek Shepherd", "country": "Greece", "type": "Guardian Dog\n", "picture": "dog230", "description": "The Greek Shepherd or Greek Sheepdog (Greek: \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03a0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2, Ellinik\u00f3s Pimenik\u00f3s) is a Greek livestock guardian dog that has been bred for centuries for guarding livestock in the mountainous regions of the country.  \n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Greek Sheepdog is a medium to large size dog, with a solid body and great physical strength that is capable of escorting the flock and also fight with the enemy while maintaining its physical superiority. Its head is massive with its muzzle-skull. The skull is normally curved, with obvious hyper eyebrow arches and it is nearly as wide as it is long. The muzzle and cheeks are wide and deep. It has a scissors or plane bite and is covered by fat and slightly loose lips. The skin is thick and is covered by dense fur. Cropping the ears is not permitted, and dogs with cropped ears cannot be shown. The brown eyes are of average size, egg-shaped, placed symmetrical in parallel lines of the oblong axon of the skull, with enough distance between each other. From the oblique side of the head their position is a little under the muzzle level, as if there is an imaginary line extended toward the skull. More dark tints are preferred. The eyelids must be tight without revealing their mucous membrane. This dog has a serious penetrating, calm look about him. The chest must be wide and deep up to the height of the elbows. The thorax consists of arched ribs with medium curvature ; they are extended backwards enough to leave enough space for the heart and the lungs. The tail is thick at the base. Some have long tails while others have short or no tails. The double coat is dense and abundant. Coat colors include black, grayish-brown and white. The breed has never been bred for color, but rather for a heavy skeleton, good muscle, and a dense, semi-long to long coat.\nDetailsHeight: Males 25\u201329 inches (65\u201375 cm) Females 23\u201326 inches (60\u201368 cm)\nWeight: Males 84\u2013110 pounds (38\u201350 kg) Females 70\u201392 pounds (32\u201342 kg)\nLife expectancy: about 12 years\nRecognition: KCG, APRI, DRA\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nA Greek Shepherd might not be suitable for first-time dog owners. As all livestock guardian dogs, they tend to be independent thinkers. They are considered brave, decisive, loyal, working dogs with a high sense of duty and strong protective instinct towards flock animals and their environment. Naturally wary, loyal only to the flock leader-shepherd, the Greek Sheepdog can be characterized as the Big Mountain shepherd\u2019s dog of Greece. They do not tolerate violent behavior or training. These independent dogs need consistent training and intelligent guidance. They need an owner who understands their flock guardian ways. When placed in a pack situation, this dog could seek to be top dog by fights. Suspicious but tactful in the presence of strangers, they do not make friends easily. They may appear calm, but are ready to protect at all costs at any time. When protecting their flock they move along the border, selecting places from where they will be able to see a wide area. They are aggressive towards the wild animals and able to drive them back with their deep bark. If their deep bark does not drive them away they will pursue the intruder and attack. Early socialization is vital if the dog is to be a trustworthy companion. They can be well trained but have a tendency to judge a situation before taking any action.\n\n\n== Greek Shepherd today ==\nThe decline of livestock farming and uncontrolled interbreeding with other dogs altered its distinctive characteristics and it has been estimated that currently, less than 3,000 pure Greek Shepherd dogs have remained in the country.  In an attempt to rescue it, Arcturos has been implementing the Greek Shepherd Dog Breeding Program since 1998. \n\n\n== See also ==\nAlopekis\nCretan Hound\nGreek Harehound\nKokoni Domestic Dog\nList of dog breeds\nKennel Club of Greece\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\u039f\u03a6\u0395\u03a0 Website\nARCTUROS Website"}, {"id": 231, "name": "Greenland Dog", "country": "Greenland", "type": "Northern Breed", "picture": "dog231", "description": "The Greenland Dog (Greenlandic: Kalaallit Qimmiat, Danish: Gr\u00f8nlandshunden) is a large breed of husky-type dog kept as a sled dog and for hunting polar bear and seal. They were brought from Siberia to North America by the Thule people 1,000 years ago, along with the Canadian Eskimo Dog that is genetically identical.\n\n\n== Lineage ==\n\nThe first dogs arrived in the Americas 12,000 years ago. However, people and their dogs did not settle in the Arctic until the Paleo-Eskimo people 4,500 years ago and then the Thule people 1,000 years ago, both originating from Siberia. Dogs first appeared in Greenland around 4,000 years ago. The Inuit dogs from Canada (Canadian Eskimo Dog) and Greenland (Greenland Dog) descended from dogs associated with Thule people, who relied on them for transportation from Siberia. In 2015, a study using a number of genetic markers indicated that these were both the same dog and should not be treated as separate breeds, that they maintain an indigenous heritage that predates colonization and the timing corresponds with the arrival of the Thule people, and that they were distinct from Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Huskies and Malamutes. The maternal mitochondrial DNA sequences of the Inuit dogs were classified as haplotype A31 that indicates a common female ancestor, and this haplotype could not be found in other modern dogs but the nearest match was with a 1,000 year\u2013old dog from Florida.In 1975, a study was made of ancient canid remains dated to the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene that had been uncovered by miners decades earlier around Fairbanks, Alaska. These were identified as Canis lupus and described as \"short-faced wolves.\" The collection was separated into those specimens that looked more wolf-like (i.e. the Beringian wolf), and those that looked more dog-like and in comparison to the skulls of Eskimo dogs from both Greenland and Siberia thought to be their forerunners.Nearly all dog breed's genetic closeness to the gray wolf is due to admixture. However, several Arctic dog breeds show a genetic closeness with the now-extinct Taimyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture. These breeds are associated with high latitudes - the Siberian Husky and Greenland Dog that are also associated with Arctic human populations, and to a lesser extent the Shar Pei and Finnish Spitz. An admixture graph of the Greenland dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material, however an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data. This indicates admixture between the Taymyr wolf population and the ancestral dog population of these 4 high-latitude breeds. This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Greenland Dog is a powerful, heavy-built dog. It has a broad, wedge-shaped head, slightly tilted eyes and small, triangular ears covered with thick fur that prevents frostbite. It has strong, muscular, short-haired legs. The tail is usually rolled along/across its back. When it lies down and curls up to rest, the tail often covers the nose. Its coat is of medium length and consists of two layers. The inner layer consists of short wool-like fur, the outer layer of longer, coarser, water-repellent fur.\nA characteristic of most Greenland Dogs is the \"\u00falo\", a triangular shaped area on the shoulders. It is named after a common woman\u2019s-knife from Greenland which is of the same shape.\nMales are significantly larger than females at between 58 and 68 cm (23\u201327 in) at the withers; females are between 51 and 61 cm (20\u201324 in).\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nIn Greenland this breed exists in much the same condition as it had when originally arriving there, and is kept chiefly as a working dog valued for its strength and speed rather than a malleable temperament. As a result of living in a pack structure, the Greenland dog takes a very firm and confident owner to make a good pet. Once respect is garnered, however, they can be very loyal and protective of their owners, especially if in a pack.\n\n\n=== Stamina ===\nAs is common among sled dogs, Greenland Dogs are able to traverse very difficult terrain with ease and with a high tempo. As working dogs they are especially valued for their physical strength and endurance.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Vikings were the first Europeans to settle in Greenland and subsequently became aware of these dogs. Then others like the early European whalers, explorers and fur traders in Canada and North America trained dog-sledding skills from the natives of the Arctic region, and used with great success the Greenland dog when hunting, exploring and traveling across the Arctic regions.\nIt is thought that the first dogs were brought to Britain around 1750; an Esquimaux bitch was exhibited at one of the earliest dog shows held in Darlington on 29 July 1875, which was reported in the Live Stock Journal and Fanciers Gazette published on 6 August 1875. They were recognized by the Kennel Club at its foundation in 1880. Greenland dogs are classified as Spitz breeds, a group of dogs characterized by their prick ears, curly tails and thick coats and are among the oldest known dog breeds in the world today.\n\nThe Greenland dog has been a draught animal in the Arctic regions for centuries and consequently they have developed a powerful body and heavy coats, with a natural capacity for load pulling and endurance in a harsh working environment. Greenland dogs have been used on many expeditions by explorers, the most famous being Fridtjof Nansen. Nansen recorded in his book P\u00e5 ski over Gr\u00f8nland, Greenland dogs being used as working dogs by the Greenland Native. Nansen was a successful polar explorer and used the dogs on his famous voyage across the Arctic Ocean in the equally famous ship Fram. Roald Amundsen used the Greenland Dogs as well on his expedition to the Antarctic. Amundsen carefully chose 97 Greenland dogs to accompany him  and his team on his expedition to Antarctica and in his subsequent South Pole expedition. Both men started with more dogs than they technically needed to pull as sledge, both intending to use them also as food for dogs and men. Amundsen's team, humans and dogs fed on dog.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCanadian Eskimo Dog\nLabrador Husky\nAlaskan Malamute\nSamoyed\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNational Geographic gallery of the breed in Greenland"}, {"id": 232, "name": "Greyhound", "country": "United Kingdom, Middle East", "type": "Sighthound and Pariah", "picture": "dog232", "description": "The Greyhound is a breed of dog, a sighthound which has been bred for coursing game and Greyhound racing. Since the rise in large-scale adoption of retired racing Greyhounds, the breed has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, a Greyhound is \"any of a breed of tall slender graceful smooth-coated dogs characterized by swiftness and keen sight\", as well as \"any of several related dogs,\" such as the Italian Greyhound.It is a gentle and intelligent breed whose combination of long, powerful legs, deep chest, flexible spine and slim build allows it to reach average race speeds exceeding 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph). The Greyhound can reach a full speed of 70 kilometres per hour (43 mph) within 30 metres (98 ft), or six strides from the boxes, traveling at almost 20 metres per second (66 ft/s) for the first 250 metres (820 ft) of a race.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nMales are usually 71 to 76 centimetres (28 to 30 in) tall at the withers, and weigh on average 27 to 40 kilograms (60 to 88 lb). Females tend to be smaller, with shoulder heights ranging from 68 to 71 centimetres (27 to 28 in) and weights from less than 27 to 34 kilograms (60 to 75 lb). Greyhounds have very short fur, which is easy to maintain. There are approximately thirty recognized color forms, of which variations of white, brindle, fawn, black, red and blue (gray) can appear uniquely or in combination. Greyhounds are dolichocephalic, with a skull which is relatively long in comparison to its breadth, and an elongated muzzle.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nGreyhounds can be aloof and indifferent to strangers, but are affectionate with their own pack. They are generally docile, lazy, easy-going, and calm.\nGreyhounds wear muzzles during racing, which can lead some to believe they are aggressive dogs, but this is not true. Muzzles are worn to prevent injuries resulting from dogs nipping one another during or immediately after a race, when the 'hare' has disappeared out of sight and the dogs are no longer racing but remain excited. \nContrary to popular belief, adult Greyhounds do not need extended periods of daily exercise, as they are bred for sprinting rather than endurance. Greyhound puppies that have not been taught how to utilize their energy, however, can be hyperactive and destructive if not given an outlet, and therefore require more experienced handlers.\n\n\n== Pets ==\nGreyhound owners and adoption groups consider Greyhounds wonderful pets. Greyhounds are quiet, gentle and loyal to owners. They are very loving, and enjoy the company of their humans and other dogs. Whether a Greyhound will enjoy the company of other small animals, such as cats, depends on the individual dog's personality. Greyhounds will typically chase small animals; those lacking a high 'prey drive' will be able to coexist happily with toy dog breeds and/or cats. Many owners describe their Greyhounds as \"45-mile-per-hour couch potatoes\".Greyhounds live most happily as pets in quiet environments. They do well in families with children, as long as the children are taught to treat the dog properly with politeness and appropriate respect. Greyhounds have a sensitive nature, and gentle commands work best as training methods.Occasionally, a Greyhound may bark; however, Greyhounds are generally not barkers, which is beneficial in suburban environments, and are usually as friendly to strangers as they are with their own families.A very common misconception regarding Greyhounds is that they are hyperactive. This is usually not the case with retired racing Greyhounds. Greyhounds can live comfortably as apartment dogs, as they do not require much space and sleep almost 18 hours per day. Due to their calm temperament, Greyhounds can make better \"apartment dogs\" than smaller, more active breeds.\nMany Greyhound adoption groups recommend that owners keep their Greyhounds on a leash whenever outdoors, except in fully enclosed areas.  This is due to their prey-drive, their speed, and the assertion that Greyhounds have no road sense. In some jurisdictions, it is illegal for Greyhounds to be allowed off-leash even in off-leash dog parks. Due to their size and strength, adoption groups recommend that fences be between 4 and 6 feet tall, to prevent Greyhounds from jumping over them.\n\n\n== Abilities ==\n\n\n=== Coursing ===\n\nThe original primary use of Greyhounds, both in the British Isles and on the Continent of Europe, was in the coursing of deer. Later, they specialized in competition hare coursing. Some Greyhounds are still used for coursing, although artificial lure sports like lure coursing and racing are far more common and popular. Many leading 300- to 550-yard sprinters have bloodlines traceable back through Irish sires, within a few generations of racers that won events such as the Irish Coursing Derby or the Irish Cup.\n\n\n=== Racing ===\n\nUntil the early twentieth century, Greyhounds were principally bred and trained for hunting and coursing. During the 1920s, modern greyhound racing was introduced into the United States, England (Belle Vue Stadium, Manchester, July 1926), Northern Ireland (Celtic Park (Belfast), April 1927), Scotland (Powderhall Stadium, August 1927) and the Republic of Ireland (Shelbourne Park, Dublin, May 1927).Australia also has a significant racing culture.Aside from professional racing, many Greyhounds enjoy success on the amateur race track. Organizations like the Large Gazehound Racing Association (LGRA) and the National Oval Track Racing Association (NOTRA) provide opportunities for Greyhounds and other sighthound breeds to compete in amateur racing events all over the United States.\n\n\n== Companion ==\n\nHistorically, the Greyhound has, since its first appearance as a hunting type and breed, enjoyed a specific degree of fame and definition in Western literature, heraldry and art as the most elegant or noble companion and hunter of the canine world. In modern times, the professional racing industry, with its large numbers of track-bred Greyhounds, as well as international adoption programs aimed at rescuing and re-homing dogs that were at a surplus to the industry. They have redefined the breed in their almost mutually dependent pursuit of its welfare- as a sporting dog that will supply friendly companionship in its retirement. Outside the racing industry and coursing community, the Kennel Clubs' registered breed still enjoys a modest following as a show dog and pet. There is an emerging pattern visible in recent years (2009\u20132010) of a significant decline in track betting and multiple track closures in the US, which will have consequences for the origin of future companion Greyhounds and the re-homing of current ex-racers.\n\n\n== Health and physiology ==\n\nGreyhounds are typically a healthy and long-lived breed, and hereditary illness is rare. Some Greyhounds have been known to develop esophageal achalasia, gastric dilatation volvulus (also known as bloat), and osteosarcoma. If exposed to E. coli, they may develop Alabama rot. Because the Greyhound's lean physique makes it ill-suited to sleeping on hard surfaces, owners of both racing and companion Greyhounds generally provide soft bedding; without bedding, Greyhounds are prone to develop painful skin sores. The average lifespan of a Greyhound is 10 to 14 years.Due to the Greyhound's unique physiology and anatomy, a veterinarian who understands the issues relevant to the breed is generally needed when the dogs need treatment, particularly when anesthesia is required. Greyhounds cannot metabolize barbiturate-based anesthesia in the same way that other breeds can because their livers have lower amounts of oxidative enzymes.  Greyhounds demonstrate unusual blood chemistry [1], which can be misread by veterinarians not familiar with the breed and can result in an incorrect diagnosis.Greyhounds are very sensitive to insecticides. Many vets do not recommend the use of flea collars or flea spray on Greyhounds if the product is a pyrethrin-based. Products like Advantage, Frontline, Lufenuron, and Amitraz are safe for use on Greyhounds, however, and are very effective in controlling fleas and ticks.Greyhounds have higher levels of red blood cells than other breeds. Since red blood cells carry oxygen to the muscles, this higher level allows the hound to move larger quantities of oxygen faster from the lungs to the muscles. Conversely, Greyhounds have lower levels of platelets than other breeds. Veterinary blood services often use Greyhounds as universal blood donors.Greyhounds do not have undercoats and thus are less likely to trigger dog allergies in humans (they are sometimes incorrectly referred to as \"hypoallergenic\"). The lack of an undercoat, coupled with a general lack of body fat, also makes Greyhounds more susceptible to extreme temperatures (both hot and cold); because of this, they must be housed inside.The key to the speed of a Greyhound can be found in its light but muscular build, large heart, highest percentage of fast-twitch muscle of any breed, double suspension gallop, and extreme flexibility of its spine. \"Double suspension rotary gallop\" describes the fastest running gait of the Greyhound in which all four feet are free from the ground in two phases, contracted and extended, during each full stride.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe breed's origin has in popular literature often been romantically connected to Ancient Egypt, in which it is believed \"that the breed dates back about 4,000 years;\" a belief for which there is no scientific evidence. While similar in appearance to Saluki (Persian Greyhound) or Sloughi (tombs at Beni Hassan c. 2000 BC), analyses of DNA reported in 2004 suggest that the Greyhound may not be closely related to these breeds, but is a close relative of herding dogs. Historical literature on the first sighthound in Europe (Arrian), the vertragus, probable antecedent of the Greyhound, suggests that its origin lies with the ancient Celts from Eastern Europe or Eurasia. Greyhound-type dogs of small, medium, and large size, appear to have been bred across Europe since that time. All modern, pure-bred pedigree Greyhounds derive from the Greyhound stock recorded and registered first in private studbooks in the 18th century, then in public studbooks in the 19th century, which ultimately were registered with coursing, racing, and kennel club authorities of the United Kingdom.\nHistorically, these sighthounds were used primarily for hunting in the open where their keen eyesight was valuable. It is believed that they (or at least similarly named dogs) were introduced to the British Isles in the 5th and 6th century BC from Celtic mainland Europe, although the Picts and other peoples of the northern British Isles (modern Scotland) were believed to have had large hounds similar to that of the deerhound before the 6th century BC.The name \"Greyhound\" is generally believed to come from the Old English grighund. \"Hund\" is the antecedent of the modern \"hound\", but the meaning of \"grig\" is undetermined, other than in reference to dogs in Old English and Old Norse. Its origin does not appear to have any common root with the modern word \"grey\" for color, and indeed the Greyhound is seen with a wide variety of coat colors. The lighter colors, patch-like markings and white appeared in the breed that was once ordinarily grey in color. The Greyhound is the only dog mentioned by name in the Bible; many versions, including the King James version, name the Greyhound as one of the \"four things stately\" in the Proverbs. However, some newer biblical translations, including The New International Version, have changed this to strutting rooster, which appears to be an alternative translation of the Hebrew term mothen zarzir. However, the Douay\u2013Rheims Bible translation from the late 4th-century Latin Vulgate into English translates this term as \"a cock.\"\nAccording to Pokorny the English name \"Greyhound\" does not mean \"grey dog/hound\", but simply \"fair dog\". Subsequent words have been derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *g'her- \"shine, twinkle\": English grey, Old High German gris \"grey, old,\" Old Icelandic griss \"piglet, pig,\" Old Icelandic gryja \"to dawn,\" gryjandi \"morning twilight,\" Old Irish grian \"sun,\" Old Church Slavonic zorja \"morning twilight, brightness.\" The common sense of these words is \"to shine; bright.\"\nIn 1928, the first winner of Best in Show at Crufts was Primley Sceptre, a Greyhound owned by H.

The Griffon Bleu de Gascogne has a speckled, rough coat.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Griffon Bleu de Gascogne is a medium-large dog, 50 to 57 cm (10.5-22.4 ins) at the withers, with a distinctive rough (shaggy) blue speckled coat, drop ears that are not as long as those on other hounds, and a tail carried up and in a slight curve.\nThe colour of the Griffon Bleu de Gascogne's coat is the same as the Grand Bleu de Gascogne, white mottled with black, giving a slate blue overall appearance. There are black patches on either side of the head, with a white area on top of the head which has in it a small black oval. Tan \"eyebrow\" marks are over each eye give a 'quatreoeuill\u00e9' (four-eyed) effect, and tan is found on the cheeks, inside the ears, on the legs, and under the tail. Texture of the coat should be hard and rough, a little shorter on the head than on the body.Faults are deviations in appearance or temperament that have an effect on the health and working ability of the dog, as well as an absence of expected features of colour, structure, and size, indicating that a dog with such faults should not be bred. Faults include timidity, soft topline, snipey muzzle, cowhocked, splayed feet, and a wolley coat.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Griffon Bleu de Gascogne is descended from crosses between the Bleu de Gascogne and the Griffon Nivernais, and possibly the Grand Griffon Vend\u00e9en as well. The breed declined for many years, but is now experiencing a revival.The breed has a good nose and a good voice, and is a good and very alert hunting dog for all kinds of hunting, not just as a pack hound for large game. Examples of the Griffon Bleu de Gascogne have been exported to other countries, where they are promoted as a rare breed for those seeking a unique pet.\n\n\n== Health and temperament ==\nNo unusual health problems or claims of extraordinary health have been documented for this breed.

The Griffon Bruxellois may refer to three different breeds, the Griffon Bruxellois, the Griffon Belge and the Petit Braban\u00e7on. Identical in standard except for coat and colour differences, in some standards they are considered varieties of the same breed, much like Belgian Shepherd Dogs.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe three variations of this dog, the Brussels Griffon (Griffon Bruxellois), the Belgian Griffon (Griffon Belge), and the Petit Braban\u00e7on, all descend from an old type of dog called a Smousje, a rough coated, small terrier-like dog kept in stables to eliminate rodents, similar to the Dutch Smoushond.  The little wire-haired dog in the foreground of the Jan van Eyck painting The Arnolfini Marriage is thought to be an early form of this breed.  In Belgium coachmen were fond of their alert little Griffons d\u2019Ecurie (wiry coated stable dogs) and in the 19th century, they bred their Griffons with imported toy dogs. Breeding with the Pug and King Charles Spaniel brought about the current breed type, but also brought the short black coat that led to the Petits Braban\u00e7on, which was originally a fault in the breed. The spaniels also brought the rich red and black and tan colour of the modern Griffon Bruxellois and Griffon Belge.The Griffon Bruxellois grew in popularity in the late 19th century with both workers and noblemen in Belgium. The first Griffon Bruxellois was registered in 1883 in the first volume Belgium's kennel club studbook, the Livre des Origines Saint-Hubert (LOSH). The popularity of the breed was increased by the interest of Queen Marie Henriette, a dog enthusiast who visited the annual dog shows in Belgium religiously, often with her daughter, and became a breeder and booster of Griffon Bruxellois, giving them international fame and popularity. Many dogs were exported to other countries, leading to Griffon Bruxellois clubs in England (1897) and Brussels Griffon clubs in the U.S. (1945.)The First World War and Second World War proved to be a disastrous time for the breed. War time is difficult on any dog breed, and the recovering numbers after the First World War were set back by increased vigilance in breeding away from faults such as webbed toes. By the end of the Second World War, Belgium had almost no native Griffon Bruxellois left, and it was only through the vigilance of dedicated breeders (in the U.K. particularly) that the breed survived at all.\nThe breed has never been numerous or popular, but had a brief vogue in the late 1950s, and now is generally an uncommon breed. There has been a recent increase in interest in the United States due to the appearance of a Griffon in the movie, As Good as It Gets, and also because of a general increase in interest in toy dogs.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Brussels Griffon is typically a small breed with a sturdy frame.  The average adult Griffon stands from 9 to 11 inches (230\u2013280 mm) tall, and weighs 8 to 10 pounds (4\u20135 kg).  They have domed heads, short noses, and an underbite.  Their human-like facial features are often likened to that of an Ewok.The Griffon comes in two coat variants, wiry/rough and smooth coat.  Their hair (not fur) can be red, black and tan, or black and reddish in color.  The short hair Griffon requires little grooming while the wiry/rough coat Griffon requires weekly grooming attention.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Griffon Bruxellois is known to have a huge heart, and a strong desire to snuggle and be with its master. They display a visible air of self-importance. A Griffon should not be shy or aggressive, but they are very emotionally sensitive, and because of this, should be socialized carefully at a young age. Griffons should also be alert, inquisitive and interested in their surroundings.\nGriffons tend to bond with one human more than others. In fact, Griffons are very good with children provided they are not teased.  They are not very patient but do love to play. Griffons tend to get along well with other animals in the house, including cats, ferrets, and other dogs.  However, they can get into trouble because they have no concept of their own relative size and may attempt to dominate dogs much larger than themselves.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nGriffons have relatively few inherited health problems, but should still be tested for congenital defects, the most serious of which are Syringomyelia (SM) and Chiari-like malformation (CM). The typical life span of a Griffon is somewhere in the range of 10 to 15 years.\n\n\n=== Birthing ===\n\nGriffons usually have no trouble whelping on their own, but sometimes complications can necessitate a Caesarean section.  The size of a litter is typically 1-3 puppies.  The size of the litter often determines the extent of these complications. Litters of six are not unheard of.  When they are born, the puppies only weigh a few ounces (about 100 grams) and are small enough to fit in the palm of an adult's hand. They can get leg and heart problems from an early age.\n\n\n=== Cleft palate ===\nOne issue that is typically fatal for the puppies is having a cleft palate.  It results in the puppy not receiving nourishment from the mother and eventually starvation.  It is uncommon but, depending on the size of the cleft, it is possible for the puppy to survive whereas it becomes older surgery can be done to close the hole.\n\n\n=== Eyes ===\nMost have large eyes that may require rechecks from a veterinarian.\n\nLacerations - Lacerations are a common issue amongst the breed.  Because the Griffons have such large eyes and a short snout, there is very little there to protect their vision from foreign bodies.  If a laceration is left untreated it can result in blindness.\nCataracts - As with most breeds, cataracts are a common problem as the dog ages.  For many breeders it is a disappointment that the cataracts typically develop long after the dog has already been bred.\nLens Luxations - Lens luxations can be fairly common in the breed and result in secondary glaucoma\nGlaucoma - Glaucoma can also be a common issue amongst Griffons owing to the breed's facial features and eye size.\n\n\n=== Heat stroke ===\nAlthough Griffons have a shortened snout, heat stroke is not a major concern for them as it is with other flat-faced breeds.  The breed's shortened muzzle may cause respiratory problems in extreme heat, but overall they tolerate both hot and cold weather well.  As with any breed, owners must use common sense and not leave them outdoors without protection from the elements or subject them to rigorous exercise during extreme temperatures, so let them in your house for cool air and some water.\n\n\n=== Syringomyelia ===\nSyringomyelia (SM) is a condition affecting the brain and spine, causing symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis. Syringomyelia is characterised by fluid filled cavities within the spinal cord. SM occurs secondary to obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) especially if that obstruction is at the foramen magnum.

The original dogs were used to hunt wolves and wild boar in the fourteenth century, and were much larger than the modern-day breed. The reconstruction of the breed was done based on the Grand Griffon Vend\u00e9en. Other breeds used were the Otterhound and Foxhounds.

As the unique breed originating in Guatemala, it is also the national dog of the country. Nowadays it has spread to various other countries, such as the USA.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe breed was created from crosses between the old type Bull Terrier, Boxer, and Dalmatian at the end of the 19th century. The two most remarkable breeders in the early history were the family Gerardi in the 1910s and the family Gallusser in the 1930s. Because of the significant Bull Terrier influence and similar appearance (the original Bull Terrier resembled more Latin American Dogos than the modern breed does), in the 20th century it was called Bullterrier Guatemalteco. Finally at the end of the 20th century, the ACANGUA officially changed the name to the Dogo Guatemalteco.

This English dog breed played a major role in the Gull Terrier\u2019s breeding development and considered as the direct ancestor of the modern Gull Terrier.\n\n\n== Origin ==\n\nDuring British Empire, British rulers introduced Bull Terriers to the Pakistan, and they crossbred Bull Terriers with local breeds to develop the Gull Terr, often called the Pakistani Bull Terrier, a medium sized dog with short, smooth fur that resembles the Bull Terrier  The British Army brought purebred English Bull Terriers to Pakistan when it was still included in the British controlled Indian Empire. These imported English dogs were crossed with the local breeds that eventually became the foundation stock of the Pakistani Gull Terr. These dogs were originally used in blood sports such as bull baiting and dog fighting, a bloody entertainment introduced by the British to the Indian subcontinent. When the blood sport was made illegal across the Empire, the Gull Terriers evolved to a very useful guard dog.\n\n\n== Personality ==\n\nThe Pakistani Gull Terrier is guard dog that will be wary towards strangers.

It had the speed and some characteristics of the coyote, but the domesticated temperament and other characteristics of a domestic dog.  It gradually lost its usefulness as aboriginal hunting methods declined, and became extinct or lost its separate identity through interbreeding with dogs in the 19th century, though some claim the breed still exists in modified form.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Hare Indian dog was a diminutive, slenderly built domesticated canid with a small head and a narrow, pointed and elongated muzzle. Its pointed ears were erect and broad at the base, and closer together than those of the Canadian Eskimo dog. Its legs were slender and rather long. The tail was thick and bushy, and it curled upwards over its right hip, though not to the extent of the Canadian Eskimo dog. The fur was long and straight, the base colour being white with large, irregular grayish black patches intermingled with various brown shades. The outside of the ears was covered with short brown hair which darkened at the base. The fur in the inside of the ears was long and white. The fur of the muzzle was short and white, as with the legs, though it became longer and thicker at the feet. Black patches were present around the eyes. Like the wolves with which it was sympatric, it had long hair between its toes, which projected over the soles, with naked, callous protuberances being present at the root of the toes and soles, even in winter. In size, it was intermediate to the coyote and the American red fox.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Hare Indian dog was apparently very playful, and readily befriended strangers, though it was not very docile, and disliked confinement of any kind.  It apparently expressed affection by rubbing its back against people, similar to a cat. In its native homeland, it was not known to bark, though puppies born in Europe learned how to imitate the barking of other dogs. When hurt or afraid, it howled like a wolf, and when curious, it made a sound described as a growl building up to a howl.\nThe Hare-Indian Dog is very playful, has an affectionate disposition, and is soon gained by kindness.  It is not, however, very docile, and dislikes confinement of every kind.  It is very fond of being caressed, rubs its back against the hand like a cat, and soon makes an acquaintance with a stranger.  Like a wild animal it is very mindful of an injury, nor does it, like a spaniel, crouch under the lash; but if it is conscious of having deserved punishment, it will hover round the tent of its master the whole day, without coming within his reach, even if he calls it.  Its howl, when hurt or afraid, is that of the wolf; but when it sees any unusual object it makes a singular attempt at barking, commencing by a kind of growl, which is not, however, unpleasant, and ending in a prolonged howl.  Its voice is very much like that of the prairie wolf [coyote]. The larger Dogs which we had for draught at Fort Franklin, and which were of the mongrel breed in common use at the fur posts, used to pursue the Hare-Indian Dogs for the purpose of devouring them; but the latter far outstripped them in speed, and easily made their escape.  A young puppy, which I purchased from the Hare Indians, became greatly attached to me, and when about seven months old ran on the snow by the side of my sledge for nine hundred miles, without suffering from fatigue. During this march it frequently of its own accord carried a small twig or one of my mittens for a mile or two; but although very gentle in its manners it showed little aptitude in learning any of the arts which the Newfoundland Dogs so speedily acquire, of fetching and carrying when ordered.  This Dog was killed and eaten by an Indian, on the Saskatchewan, who pretended that he mistook it for a fox. The most extraordinary circumstance in this relation is the great enduranceof the puppy, which certainly deserves special notice.  Even the oldest and strongest Dogs are generally incapable of so long a journey as nine hundred miles (with probably but little food), without suffering from fatigue.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIt is thought by one writer that the breed originated from a cross between native Tahltan bear dogs and dogs brought to the North American continent by Viking explorers, as it bears strong similarities to Icelandic breeds in appearance and behavior.  Sir J. Richardson of Edinburgh, on the other hand, who studied the breed in the 1820s, in their original form before being diluted by crossings with other breeds, could detect no decided difference in form between this breed and a coyote, and surmised that it was a domesticated version of the wild animal. He wrote, \"The Hare Indian or Mackenzie River Dog bears the same relation to the prairie wolf [coyote] as the Esquimeaux Dog [Malamute] does to the great grey wolf.\"  The  breed seemed to be kept exclusively by the Hare Indians and other neighboring tribes, such as the Bear, Mountain, Dogrib, Cree, Slavey and Chippewa tribes living in the Northeastern Territories of Canada and the United States around the Great Bear Lake, Southwest to Lake Winnipeg and Lake Superior and West to the Mackenzie River. They were valued by the Indians as coursorial hunters, and they subsisted almost entirely on the produce of each hunt. Although not large enough to pose a danger to the moose and reindeer they hunted,  their small size and broad feet allowed them to pursue  large ungulates in deep snow,  keeping them at bay until the hunters arrived. It was too small to be used as a beast of burden. It was the general belief among the Indians that the dog's origin was connected to the Arctic fox. When first examined by European biologists, the Hare Indian dog was found to be almost identical  to the coyote in  build (save for the former's smaller skull) and fur length. The first Hare Indian dogs to be taken to Europe were a pair presented to the Zoological Society of London, after Sir John Richardson's and  John Franklin's Coppermine Expedition of 1819\u20131822. Though originally spread over most of the northern regions of North America, the breed fell into decline after the introduction of firearms made its hunting abilities unnecessary. It gradually intermingled with other breeds such as the Newfoundland dog, the Canadian Eskimo dog and mongrels.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTahltan Bear Dog\nCanadian Eskimo dog\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHare Indian Dogs\nThe Hare Indian Dog"}, {"id": 242, "name": "Harrier (dog)", "country": "United Kingdom", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog242", "description": "The Harrier is a medium-sized  dog breed of the  hound class, \nused for hunting hares by trailing them. It resembles an English Foxhound but is smaller, though not as small as a Beagle.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Harrier is similar to the English Foxhound, but smaller. Harriers stand between 19 and 21 inches at the shoulder, and adults weigh between 45 and 65 lbs. They do shed, have short hair and hanging ears, and come in a variety of color patterns. A humorous, description of a Harrier is that of \"a Beagle on steroids\"  but it resembles an English Foxhound.  It is a muscular hunting hound with a small, hard coat. It has large bones for stamina and strength.  The Harrier is slightly longer than tall, with a level topline. The tail is medium-length, carried high, but is not curled over the back. The skull is broad with a strong square muzzle. The rounded ears are pendant, and the eyes are either brown or hazel. The wide nose is black. The expression is mellow when the dog is relaxed and alert when he is excited. The teeth should meet in a scissors or level bite. The feet are tight and cat-like, and the front toes may turn inward.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe Harrier is  cheerful, sweet-tempered,  tolerant of people, and it is excellent with children. This pack dog is good with other dogs, but should be supervised with non-canine pets unless it is raised with them from puppyhood. It prefers life in a pack with people, dogs, or both. This active dog likes to go exploring, sniffing, and trailing, so be sure to keep it on a leash or in a safe enclosed area. Some Harriers like to bay.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThis breed's lifespan is generally 12\u201315 years. Hip dysplasia is known to occur in this breed.\n\n\n== Care ==\nThe coat needs only occasional brushing to remove dead hair.\n\n\n=== Exercise ===\nThe Harrier requires daily exercise, such as long vigorous walks or runs. Allowing them to play in open space (so long as it is enclosed and safe) makes exercise fun and easy. Without appropriate exercise, the Harrier can become hyperactive, overweight and/or destructive. While this dog was bred to run and work all day long and cannot be satisfied by a completely sedentary lifestyle, they adapt very well to the average home.\n\n\n== History of the Harrier Dog ==\nSources have widely conflicting stories about the origins of this breed. According to one, the earliest Harrier types were crossed with Bloodhounds, the Talbot Hound, and even the Basset Hound. According to another, the breed was probably developed from crosses of the English Foxhound with Fox Terrier and Greyhound. And yet another, the Harrier is said to be simply a bred-down version of the English Foxhound. The first Harrier pack in England was established by Sir Elias de Midhope in 1260 and spread out as a hunting dog throughout the west of England and into Wales. Although there are many working Harriers in England, the breed is still not recognised in that country.\nIn any case, today's Harrier is between the Beagle and English Foxhound in size and was developed primarily to hunt hares, though the breed has also been used in fox hunting. The name, Harrier, reveals the breed's specialty. The Harrier has a long history of popularity as a working pack dog in England.\nThe Harrier is the most commonly used hound by hunts in Ireland, with  166 harrier packs, 37 of them mounted packs and 129 of them foot packs, spread throughout the country. More commonly in Ireland it is used to hunt both foxes and hares, with some packs hunting mainly foxes.\nThis breed of dog is recognized in 1885 by the American Kennel Club and is classified in the Hound Group.The Harrier Club of America cites the earliest description of a Harrier in \"The Chace\" by William Somervile which was written in 1735.\nSee there with count'nance blithe,And with a courtly grin, the fawning houndSalutes thee cow'ring, his wide op'ning noseUpward he curls, and his large sloe-black eyesMelt in soft blandishments and humble joy;His glossy skin, or yellow-pied, or blue,In lights or shades by Nature's pencil drawn,Reflects the various tints; his ears and legs,Fleckt here and there, in gay enamel'd pride,Rival the speckled pard; his rush-grown tailO'er his broad back bends in an ample arch;On shoulders clean, upright and firm he stands;His round cat-foot, straight hams, and wide-spread thighs,And his low-dropping chest, confess his speed,Or far extended plain; in ev'ry partSo well proportion'd, that the nicer skillOf Phidas himself can't blame thy choice.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHunting with Harriers\nList of beagle, harrier and basset packs of the United Kingdom\nList of hound packs of Ireland\nList of hound packs of New Zealand\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHarrier (dog) at Curlie"}, {"id": 243, "name": "Havanese dog", "country": "Cuba", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog243", "description": "Havanese (a Bichon type dog) is the national dog of Cuba, developed from the now extinct Blanquito de la Habana (\"little white dog of Havana\"). The Blanquito descended from the also now extinct Bichon Tenerife. It is believed that the Blanquito was eventually cross-bred with other Bichon types, including the Poodle, to create what is now known as the Havanese. Sometimes referred to as \"Havana Silk Dogs\", this was originally another name for the Blanquito de la Habana.\nThe Havanese is small in size and sturdy in structure with a tail carried over its back and ears that drop and fold. The coat is abundant, long, and silky and comes in all colors. The Havanese has a spirited personality and a curious disposition, and is notable for its springy gait, a characteristic that distinguishes the breed from all others. The Havanese is considered an ideal family pet and a true companion dog. They are highly adaptable to almost any environment. Because of their strong social needs, Havanese will not thrive in an environment where they are isolated for several hours each day.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThough it is a toy dog, Havanese are sturdy and not overly delicate. Most are 10 to 16 pounds (4.5 to 7.3 kg) and 8 1\u20442 to 11 1\u20442 inches (22 to 29 cm), with the ideal being 9 to 10 1\u20442 inches (23 to 27 cm) at the withers. The body, measured from point of shoulder to point of buttocks, is slightly longer than the height at the withers, giving the dog the appearance of being slightly longer than tall. The length of the body results from the long ribcage, not the loins.\nA unique aspect of the breed is the topline, which rises just slightly from withers to croup, creating a topline that is straight but not level. Renowned for their flashy, lively gait, when on the move, their strong rear drive and slightly shorter upper arm produce a springy motion rather than a far-reaching one. The angle of the topline does not change while moving at a natural gait.\nThe muzzle is full and tapers slightly at the nose. It does not have the appearance of being short or snipy. Length of skull measured from stop to point of occiput is equal to the length of muzzle. The top of the skull is rather flat and the backskull is rounded.\nThe length from foot to elbow is equal to the length from elbow to withers.  The forechest is pronounced. When in a standing position, the sternum lines up with the elbows, creating a deep chest. Ribs are well-sprung and the abdomen is moderately tucked up.The Havanese has dark brown eyes and almond-shaped lids surrounded by black pigment. The ears, when extended, reach half way to the nose. They arc slightly upward at the base and hang down on the sides of the head without touching the face. The tail is carried arched forward up over the back. While the tail's long plume of hair falls on the body, the tail itself never touches the back.\nThe breed standard notes that except for slight trimming around the feet to allow for a tidy foot, they are to be shown untrimmed; any further trimming, back-combing, or other fussing is against type and will not be allowed to the point of precluding placement in dog shows. The breed standard specifies that the tail may not be docked. The American Kennel Club Standard allows head furnishings above each eye to be held in two small braids secured with plain elastic bands. However, many owners prefer to clip their pet's hair short for easy upkeep.\n\n\n==== Color and markings ====\n\nAlthough there are a few arguments on whether the original Havanese were all white or of different colors, modern Havanese are acceptable in all coat colors and patterns. All colored dogs should have a black nose and black pigment around the eyes, with the exception of chocolate (brown) dogs, which may have dark brown pigment on their nose instead. Examples of coat colors are white, cream, fawn, red, chocolate brown, beige, gold, silver, blue, and black. The coat may be one solid color or have markings in one or more other colors. For example, sable, brindle, black & tan, Tri-color, Irish pied, parti colored, belton, or piebald, black and white, beige black, and white.\n\n\n==== Coat ====\nThe coat is long, soft, lightweight, and silky. The Havanese coat is slightly wavy, profuse, and undulating. Unlike other double-coated breeds, the Havanese outer coat is neither coarse nor overly dense, but rather soft and light. The undercoat is sometimes completely absent. The Havanese coat should be very soft, almost cool to the touch, like unrefined silk (compared to the Maltese coat, which feels like refined silk). However, in some dogs the coat can become too silky, looking oily. On the other end of the spectrum, Havanese coats can be too harsh or cottony, giving a frizzy appearance.\nBecause of the tropical nature of the Havanese, the fine and lightweight coat is designed to act as a sunshade and cooling agent on hot days. This means that, though the coat is abundant and may appear warm, the Havanese must be protected from the cold. These dogs become cold very easily so keeping their coat longer in winter time is essential, especially since these dogs originate from hot weather.\nThe coat is shown naturally brushed out, or in some countries it may be corded, a technique which turns the long coat into cords of hair, similar to dreadlocks in humans. This corded look may be difficult to achieve for the first timer, so it is always recommended that someone interested in cording their Havanese consults someone who has done it before. Brushing out their fur is essential. This breed's fur grows very fast and without brushing it, the fur can become tangled easily. Also, even though this breed is hypoallergenic, Havanese have hair that doesn't fall off (shed) but it still needs to be groomed.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe Havanese is a toy dog. It is smart and can be easily trained. It is best to train this dog at a young age, because some habits will stick as they become older. However, training these dogs while they are older is still possible. Like many toy breeds, the Havanese can be difficult to housebreak. However, Havanese can be trained to use a litter box, which can greatly reduce issues with housebreaking. This breed is very smart and can be house trained faster than most toy dogs. The Havanese get very attached and are very loyal to their owners, and often attach to one person which they will closely follow. As a result, the Havanese does not do well in a household where it will be left alone all day. Although the Havanese is an active and lively dog, they are small enough that many of their exercise needs can be met in a house or yard, and therefore they do not require as much vigorous exercise as other breeds may. However, exercise is still necessary for this breed to be happy and healthy.The Havanese is satisfied when their owner is satisfied. They are very friendly dogs, and do not typically bark at strangers, but some individuals are more shy than others. The Havanese has a great personality and temperament, and loves to play outside and be around people. They are not a dog that can live exclusively outside and prefer being inside with their owner. They love to perform in front of others and have a great need for affection. This breed is not afraid to show affection and loves getting attention. They manage well with people of all ages and can thrive in any size home.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nHavanese are generally healthy and sturdy with relatively few serious health issues. They typically live 14 to 16 years. Havanese organizations, such as the Havanese Club of America, monitor genetic issues to prevent propagation within the breed.\nHavanese suffer primarily from luxating patella, liver disease, heart disease, cataracts and retinal dysplasia. Havanese sometimes tear and may develop brown tear stains, especially noticeable on white or light coats.\nThe Havanese Club of America developed a system to encourage widespread participation of seven recommended tests for eye disease (CERF), congenital deafness (BAER), patella luxation, cardiac diseases, hip dysplasia, hip joint disorder (Legg-Calve-Perthes), and elbow dysplasia. The Canine Health Information Center (CHIC) program promotes testing and reporting of health test results for the Havanese breed. CHIC is a centralized canine health database jointly sponsored by the AKC Canine Health Foundation (CHF) and the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA). Testing required for a Havanese to receive a CHIC certificate includes OFA BAER, OFA Hips, OFA Patellas, and annual CERF exams. This provides an outstanding research tool for performing searches on individual dogs and also links health testing results of the dog's related pedigree information (parent, offspring, and sibling), when those related dogs have been health tested.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Havanese is a member of the Bichon family of dogs. The progenitors of the breed are believed to have come from Tenerife. Ship manifests from Tenerife bound for Cuba list dogs as passengers brought aboard, and these dogs were most probably the dog of Tenerife. Some believe the entire Bichon family of dogs can be traced back to the Tenerife dog, while others theorize that the origins are in Malta, citing the writings of Aristotle, and other historical evidence of the early presence of such dogs in Malta. Whatever the actual origins of Bichon dogs, these little dogs soon became devoted companions to the Spanish colonists in Cuba and were highly admired by the nobility.As part of the Cuban Revolution, upper-class Cubans fled to the United States, but few were able to bring their dogs. When American breeders became interested in this rare and charming dog in the 1970s, the US gene pool was only 11 dogs. The American Kennel Club (AKC) only officially recognized the Havanese breed in 1996.With dedicated breeding, and the acquisition of some new dogs internationally, the Havanese has made a huge comeback and is one of the fastest growing breeds of dogs in the AKC. The 2013 AKC Statistics rank the Havanese as the 25th most popular pure-breed in the United States, a rise in popularity from 28th place in 2012.\n\n\n== At work ==\n\nBecause of the Havanese's friendly and readily trained nature, it is used for a variety of jobs involving the public, including:\n\nTherapy dogs\nAssistance dogs, such as signal dogs for the hearing impaired.\nPerforming dogs\nMold and termite detection\nTrackingHavanese also compete in a variety of dog sports, such as\n\nDog agility\nFlyball\nMusical canine freestyle\nObedience training\n\n\n== Care ==\n\nThe profuse coat needs to be thoroughly combed at least twice per week. A Havanese with a dense or curly coat will be more prone to tangling and matting, thus requiring more frequent combing, than one with a silky, slightly wavy coat. If not showing the dog, it can be trimmed shorter to require less brushing. Many pet owners clip their dogs into a 1\u20132 inch long \"puppy cut\" for ease of maintenance.\nIf they go out in the snow, ice clumps will stick between their paw pads; just rinse off in warm water or buy booties. When owners give them a bath, they must make sure to dry them. Some in shorter clips can blot and air dry, but most will need to be blown dry. Owners can also comb their hair out after bathing so as not to dry in mats. Use high air but low heat to protect their sensitive skin. Hot air can damage the skin.\nHair that grows on the bottom of their feet between the paw-pads needs trimming to allow traction on smooth floors. Some develop tear staining. A veterinarian might suggest treating red yeast issues to help diminish or eliminate staining; sometimes diet allergens are to blame and switching to a food without common allergens can be helpful. Excess tearing is sometimes a result of hair getting into the eyes; it is recommended that hair below eyes be allowed to grow out instead of shaved out. Havanese can wear a topknot or small braids to keep the hair out of their eyes during everyday activities.\nAs with any dog with dropped ears, the ears must be kept clean to help prevent ear infections. A cottonball can be placed just inside each ear before bathing to prevent excess water from entering in. After bathing, since it may be moist, pluck a few hairs inside the dog's ears to let air circulate through, preventing fungus from building.\nThe Havanese is not a yappy dog, but will alert its owners to approaching people. Usually acknowledging that you have heard their alert is enough to make them cease. Some have strong attachment issues, known by their owners as \"velcro dogs\", following household members everywhere, even into the bathroom.\n\n\n== Havana Silk ==\nA Havana Silk Dog is a type of dog from Cuba.  The modern Havana Silk Dog is derived solely from recent Havanese dogs. Breeders have sought to re-create older depictions of the breed based on paintings, sculptures, and written descriptions.  Compared to some Havanese, breeders seek to give the Havana Silk longer, straighter forelegs, a flatter, silkier coat, a longer muzzle, and smaller ears.After 10 years of attempting to convince Havanese breeders to breed away from osteochondrodysplasia, many of the original leadership of the Havanese Club of America decided to leave the organization in order to create a breed that they feel more accurately represents the original dogs from Cuba.\nThey began referring to their dogs as Havana Silk Dogs, claiming them to be a different breed from the Havanese. However, the Havana Silk Dog is not recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) as separate from the Havanese, and many Havana Silk Dogs are also registered under the name \"Havanese\" with the AKC. The Havana Silk Dog Association of America is not currently seeking to register their breed with the AKC.\nIn an effort to preserve type and sound health, Havana Silk Dog breeders do not \"cross-breed\" their dogs with a Havanese who is not registered as a Havana Silk Dog.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLap dog\nRare breed (dog)\nCompanion Dog Group\nToy Group\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHavanese dog at Curlie"}, {"id": 244, "name": "Hawaiian Poi Dog", "country": "United States", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog244", "description": "The Hawaiian Poi Dog (Hawaiian: \u02bb\u012blio or \u02bb\u012blio m\u0101ku\u02bbe) is an extinct breed of pariah dog from Hawai\u02bbi which was used by Native Hawaiians as a spiritual protector of children and as a source of food.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe original Hawaiian poi dog were descended from the Polynesian dogs brought to the Hawaiian Islands by the Polynesian people. Genetic studies on the New Zealand kuri dog indicate that the origin of this dog (and therefore probably the Hawaiian dog) is Indonesia. Referred as the \u02bb\u012blio in the Hawaiian language, the modern name of this breed is derived from poi, a Hawaiian staple food made from kalo or taro root. Poi was used to fatten the dogs for use as food because meat was too valuable to be used as dog food. Since the Hawaiian Islands did not have large land mammals other than feral hogs, Poi dogs were not needed for hunting. The dogs were never deliberately bred to a standard, but human and natural selection still came into play.\nEuropean explorers like Captain Cook encountered pot-bellied, short-legged poi dogs that freely associated with hogs in the village. The dogs had very short hair that could come in any color, but brown poi dogs were regarded as distinct enough to warrant a specific name. The dogs also had peculiarly flattened heads. The latter trait is sometimes ascribed to the diet of the dogs in some unspecified way. Considering that poi does not require chewing, the dogs might have lost the need to maintain strong temporalis muscles; a reduced temporal fossa will cause a dog's head to appear flattened. Poi dogs were considered rather dim-witted and sluggish \u2013 any good hunting dog with acute senses would neither make a good poi dog, nor be particularly useful on the islands \u2013 however, the dogs were strong-willed and not easily commanded.The poi dog was a two-purpose breed \u2013 used for food and as a lucky charm. Unsuited for anything else, the breed declined to extinction as the native religion was abandoned and eating dog meat became unfashionable. Feral dogs of European settlers interbred with the poi dogs, and by the early 20th century at latest, the breed disappeared as a distinct entity.\n\n\n== Surviving depictions ==\n\nNo surviving artwork or photograph from Hawaiian history are authentically attributed as poi dogs. Often Western artists infused Euro-American characteristics in their 18th-century depictions of the dogs of Polynesia and by the 19th century, the dogs being depicted were of foreign breeds. The lack of details has led historians to guess at what works may be realistic depictions of the breed based on the physical characteristics.Writers Katharine Luomala and Margaret Titcomb both agreed an unfinished line drawing, dated to c. 1816\u201317, by French artist Louis Choris, who was part of the exploring expedition of Otto von Kotzebue, may show one of the dogs in center which may resemble the extinct breed. Luomala also claims French artist Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Lauvergne possibly captured a dog with the same traits in his colored drawing of Honolulu Harbor in 1836.Ancient Hawaiian petroglyphs also depict simplified representation of the dogs. They often show the curl tails and pointed ears characteristics of the breed.\n\n\n== Breeding program ==\n\nIn 1967, Jack L. Throp, director of the Honolulu Zoo, attempted to bring back the breed through selective breeding of local dogs based on morphological characteristics. The project studied 18th- and 19th-century descriptions of the dog before 1825 and also the surviving skeletal remains of the ancient breed to set a standard. From this they selected local dogs in Hawaii, who were then bred for the desired traits. By the third generation from the original dogs selected in the program, a female was born with the desired appearance of the ancient breed.\nCommenting in 1969, Throp noted:\n\nThe Honolulu Zoo undertook a project in 1967 to re-create the Polynesian dog. The purpose behind such a project is to tell the story of the animal life of the Hawaiian Islands in a living Hawaiian exhibit. The dog is an important part of the Polynesians' contribution to this story.\nThe program is thought to have discontinued shortly afterward. In 1976, the crews on the H\u014dk\u016ble\u02bba on their expedition to recreate the historical Polynesian voyage between Hawaii and Tahiti brought along a dog from this program which they named Hoku.\n\n\n== Usage ==\nToday, the term \"poi dog\" is most often used to refer to mutts or mixed breed dogs, but also attribute specific characteristics to Poi dogs, including the ability to eat anything, a strong will, and a unique appearance composed of different breeds. The term \"poi dog\" is also colloquially used to describe people of mixed heritage, although the more common term in use is hapa.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKur\u012b \u2013 breed of Polynesian dogs native to New Zealand\n\u02bb\u016ar\u012b M\u0101\u2019ohi \u2013 breed of Polynesian dogs native to the Society Islands\nMarquesan Dog \u2013 breed of Polynesian dogs native to the Marquesas Islands\n\n\n== Footnotes and references ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCoren, Stanley (2006).

This mountain dog breed is closely similar to Tibetan Mastiff and may be related to the long-haired Kinnaur Sheepdog of Tibet. Naturally, Himalayan Sheepdogs enjoy outdoor lifestyles and are rarely seen beyond the regions of India and Nepal. As a powerful and robust breed, the Himalayan Sheepdog is mainly used for herding purposes.  The Himalayan Sheepdog is regionally popular as both a loyal companion as well as a working dog.\nFour commemorative postage stamps were issued on 9 January 2005 by India Post for four breeds (sic.) i.e. Himalayan Sheep Dog, Rampur Hound, Mudhol Hound (Face value Rs. 5.00 each) and Rajapalayam (Face value Rs. 15.00)\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nDue to its active nature, this breed is not meant to keep indoors for a long period of time or in an apartment. The Himalayan Sheepdog is normally used as a herd dog or a watchdog and requires a great amount of outdoor exercise. This breed may require obedience training in order to domesticate them. Training this breed may be difficult due to its independent and stubborn nature. Trust and dominance should be enforced when training the Himalayan Sheepdog. To successfully train this breed, it is best to be stern when doing repetitive training exercises and to socialize them as puppies. Proper care of this breed includes daily exercise and training. Although this rustic breed may be inclined to be ferocious with strangers, they are loyal to their owners making them faithful companions. Aside from being alert and territorial, they are also affectionate and gentle to their owners, making them suitable family pets. It is advised that this breed should not be in the presence of other pets, as Himalayan Sheepdogs tend to show aggression and jealousy towards other animals.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe life expectancy of the Himalayan Sheepdog is ten years. This breed is known to be relatively healthy due to their active lifestyles but is also prone to a few health concerns. Some common health problems include hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, patellar luxation, arthritis, glaucoma, and obesity. Proper care of this breed includes daily exercise and training.\n\n\n== History ==\nAlthough the exact origin of the Himalayan Sheepdog has not been well documented, they are believed to have a rich heritage in Nepal and North India. This breed is also believed to have been around since the ancient times of those regions. Local tribes within the regions of Nepal have used the dogs as guard dogs or herding dogs due to their known aggression and agility. The Himalayan Sheepdog was most commonly used to herd and guard cattle from predatory animals. Throughout their history, the breed was also used to hunt large game especially in the harsh terrains in its region. Currently, this breed is common only within the boundaries of India and Nepal.\n\nThis essay is also found in the spoken version of \n\n\n== See also ==\nTibetan Mastiff\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBhotia Breeds by Barbara Gard\nHimalayan Sheepdog Article Indiatimes Article\nToby Needs a Home Article by Czajkowski, Christine H."}, {"id": 246, "name": "Hokkaido (dog)", "country": "Japan", "type": "Northern Breed", "picture": "dog246", "description": "The Hokkaido (\u5317\u6d77\u9053\u72ac, Hokkaid\u014d-inu or Hokkaid\u014d-ken) is a breed of dog originating from Japan. Other names for the breed include Ainu-ken, Seta, Ainu dog. In Japan, its name is sometimes shortened to D\u014d-ken (\u9053\u72ac). The Hokkaido is native to the prefecture of the same name in Japan.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe breed is medium in size, with small, triangular, upright ears. The small eyes have a rising triangular outline. The Hokkaido has a coat of long, stiff fur, and a second, shorter coat of soft fur. Colors include red, white, black, brindle, sesame, black and tan, and wolf-gray. Males are typically 50 cm (20 in) tall at the withers, females slightly shorter, with body masses in the 20 kg (44 lb) range. Dogs bred on continents outside of their native Japan may be smaller.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe breed is known for fidelity to its owner, bravery, and the ability to withstand the cold, among other traits. It has an innate sense of direction and smell, and can therefore return to its master no matter how great the distance. Temperament will vary depending on the lineage and region of upbringing. \nTraditionally in Japan, the dog has been used as a working breed that plays both the role of family pet and hunter. In Japan, they are strongly tied to hunting kennels and work alongside their handlers to manage populations of wild boar and bear. Their vocal nature manifests in varying types of characteristic howls, long and short barks, used as sighting signals on hunts. They have an unusual fighting style against the Hokkaido brown bear, or higuma, and will take risks to protect its master, despite size differences. The way in which the Ainu dog accomplishes this is to attack the bear's back, then bite and hold the dorsal flesh of the bear's neck until the bear retreats. For this purpose, the Hokkaido in Japan are encouraged to have a fierce and unrelenting character that benefits in the field.\nBrought up as a family pet, Hokkaido may deviate from the more primal temperament exhibited with dogs in hunting kennels. The Hokkaido is highly intelligent and food motivated, a combination that results in positive responses to training. Hunting dogs are encouraged to be vocal, but a Hokkaido as a family pet may not necessarily exhibit such habits with training. As the Hokkaido has very little distribution throughout countries outside Japan, the Hokkaido's temperament solely as a family pet is still forming. Although the Hokkaido carries an innate prey drive, early socialization shows good behaviors with cats and other small animals considered to be part of its 'pack'.\nThe Hokkaido's play is different from other breeds, with a more crouch and prowl style of play that is often misunderstood as aggression. For this reason, Hokkaido are often considered to be leash only animals. However, with its roots to hunting, they have excellent owner stickiness and work well with recall techniques.\nThey are good with children and other animals if they are raised with them from puppyhood and/or properly socialized. The Hokkaido needs moderate but regular exercise to stay in shape. It should be taken for long daily walks.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Hokkaido is thought to have its roots in the Matagi-ken \uff08Japanese:\u30de\u30bf\u30ae\u72ac\uff09\uff08hunting dog, bear hunting dog, deer hunting dog\uff09 a breed brought by the Ainu people from the T\u014dhoku region in the J\u014dmon period. The later Yayoi people brought a different breed to the T\u014dhoku, but the isolation of Hokkaido led to its line of J\u014dmon dog having the least influence from the Yayoi.\nIn 1869, the English zoologist Thomas W. Blankiston gave the breed the name Hokkaido.\nThe breed was useful in the search for survivors of an Army expedition that was caught in heavy snow crossing the Hakk\u014dda Mountains of Aomori Prefecture in 1902.\nIn 1937, the Ainu dog was designated in Japan as \"a rare species protected by law\" by the Ministry of Education and it was decided that the official name of the breed would be Hokkaido-Inu. However, the dogs are almost always called Hokkaido-Ken among the Japanese people.\nIn 2007, Japanese telecom company SoftBank began using a white Hokkaido named Kai-kun (\u30ab\u30a4\u304f\u3093) in its commercial campaigns for their White Plan where he stars as \"Father\" (\u304a\u7236\u3055\u3093, Ot\u014dsan) or Jiro Shirato (\u767d\u6238 \u6b21\u90ce, Shirato Jir\u014d), the patriarch of the Shirato family, with his wife portrayed by Kanako Higuchi, children portrayed by Aya Ueto and Dante Carver, and mother portrayed by Ayako Wakao; Father's speaking voice is provided by Kin'ya Kita\u014dji. The commercial series won the 2008 ACC Grand Prix Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications Award. The American director, producer, screenwriter, and noted Japanophile, Quentin Tarantino, guest-starred in an installment of this series of commercials.\nThe breed is extremely rare outside its native country. In Japan there is an estimated population of around 10,000-12,000, and yearly registrations of between 900-1000 (all registries). Approximately 25 are known to live in North America.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Hokkaido dog has a very high rate of Collie eye anomaly (CEA).

It is a dog of large size, of lean but at the same time robust build, of considerably elongated proportions. In its everyday life the hortaya is quiet and balanced. It has a piercing sight, capable of seeing a moving object at a very far distance. In spite of its calm temperament the dog has a very active reaction to running game. Hortaya are excellent, enduring hunting dogs endowed with a good, basic obedience and completely lacking aggression towards humans.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe hortaya is a sight hound of a large to very large size depending on breed type. The breed has five distinct types, with at least as many subtypes to each main type. The result of this is a broad variability, adapting the breed to the large variety of geography, climate and prey found across the huge expanse of its habitat.\nAll breed standards for hortaya are performance based, rather than appearance based, but because certain characteristics make for skilled hunting dogs, most hortaya are very similar in shape and build. The legs are long, the spine flexible, and the chest disproportionately deep in comparison to the waist, in order to accommodate large, powerful lungs. Small ears and a long, narrow skull are typical.\nHortaya males range from 26 to 30 inches (65 to 75 cm), females from 24 to 28 inches (61 to 71 cm). The weight depends largely on type and can range from 18 kilograms (Stavropol-type female) up to 35 kilograms (northern-type male). In general, the hortaya is heavier than it looks.\nWhen not hunting, the typical gait of the breed is a fluid, limber and effortless trot. When chasing the prey, hortaya gallop in fast leaps of great length.\nThe short, dense fur can come in any color, as the only breed standards for the hortaya are health and skill. Dark coloured dogs typically have a black nose, while light coloured dogs typically have a brown nose. Eyes may be any color, and typically have a black or very dark rim.\nStarting in the 2000s, some hortaya were exported to parts of Europe and North America (see below), where a breed standard for a new, as-yet unnamed subtype was established. Among these dogs, coat colour and colour combinations are restricted to a few types: white, black, cream of all shades, red, sable and brindle, solid or piebald (with white markings, or white with coloured markings). A black overlay and black mask, grey or red tan markings are normal. Atypical colours and markings, like brown or chocolate, a saddle or dapple pattern, and diluted colors (isabella) with blue or light eyes are not allowed. This subtype is still being defined, and further restrictions may be implemented, but it should be noted that the standard of the original hortaya remains unchanged.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe hortaya borzaya is of a friendly, but distinctly Asian character. It is never aggressive or fierce towards humans, even though occasionally quite vigilant. Due the rigorous selection on hunting in a team with its owner, the hortaya belongs to the trainable sight hounds, showing a good basic obedience and high intelligence.\nIt is very close to wolves in its pack behaviour. Thus it is usually no problem to keep even larger groups of hortaya together in a kennel; hortaya integrate easily.\nAs rural people in Eurasia do not at all tolerate dogs which harm their livestock, properly socialized hortaya do not hunt domestic animals, and can easily be taught which animals are off limits to them.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThe breed is late in development, very vigorous and long-lived. It is not rare that older dogs, retired from active hunting, start their breeding career at an age of 8 or 9 years in perfect health and without any impairment. Breed-specific illnesses or hereditary diseases, such as hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia, are so far unknown. The life expectancy of the hortaya borzaya largely depends on its use.In regions where they are hunted on large prey, especially predators, there may be quite some dogs killed young during the hunt. If you subtract these dangers, 14-15 healthy years as an average is not uncommon.\nHowever, great care has to be taken in not over-feeding the hortaya pup and juvenile. The breed was formed on a meagre, extremely basic and low diet with but rare and small amounts of meat, especially high quality meat.\nMost of the year hortaya get little more than the scraps from the table, a gruel of oats, bread soaked in milk and whatever rodents they can hunt for themselves around the house. Only during the spring slaughter/lambing season and the main hunting season they get more meat: the innards and offals from what they hunt for their masters. As a result, this breed has practically no tolerance for high quality, high protein dog foods and supplements, and especially the young, still growing dogs will suffer irreversible and lethal damage to their bone structure and cartilage when faultily fed.\n\n\n== Use and activity ==\nIn its original habitat, the hortaya borzaya is still purely a hunting sight hound. It is used on all game living in the steppe, especially for hunting hares, foxes, wolves and Saiga antelopes. It is extremely enduring, capable of working from early morning to late evening. Up to 8\u201310 runs on game in a day (including tracking prey together with the hunter across large distances) is a perfectly feasible workload. Unlike the Whippet or Greyhound, the hortaya is not a short distance sprinter. Game is usually chased for distances up to 4 km (2.5 mi) on the open steppe, and a hortaya can repeat such runs after only a short rest. Unlike most sight hounds, the hortaya does not hunt using sight alone; it often will track game it has lost sight of using its well-developed sense of smell.\n\nHortaya hunt singly on smaller game, or as pairs and larger groups on wolves, antelopes and deer. Small game is hunted and killed immediately, larger game is cornered and held in place for the hunter. The hortaya has a \"soft mouth\" like the Retriever breeds. After a quick kill, the game must not be rent as native hunters also use the furs. In the CIS hunting sight hounds are regularly tested, judged and graded in so-called \"hunt trials\".\nThe first hortaya have recently been officially exported with full breeding papers to European countries, e.g. Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany (2004), Finland and Switzerland. In 2005, the first hortaya was also exported to the United States. Some of these dogs participate in racing and coursing, partly out of competition due to the lack of international FCI recognition. Hortaya owned by European owners have shown an aptitude for Agility, Breitensport and have proven to be excellent trail companions for horseback riders. The first registered litter outside of the hortaya's historical habitat was born in Europe in 2006.\n\n\n== Breeding ==\n\nContrary to the practice of Western breeding and breeders of other dog breeds, the hortaya is not regarded as an unfinished breed which still needs any amelioration or even formation.\nThe shorthaired sightdog of the southern Eurasian steppes, which today trades under the name of hortaya borzaya, was bred in this habitat for thousands of years, is a breed as old as the Tazi/Saluki and only marginally younger than the Bakhmul/Afghan. For newcomers it would be unwise to be deceived by the relatively recent standard.\nAnalogous to the oriental and Asian breeds of thoroughbred horses the original breeders of hortaya consider it rightfully as firmly consolidated. An improvement into any direction therefore is not part of breeding hortaya. This is an important and massive difference to the western way of dog breeding and it has far reaching, very positive consequences for the breeding practice.\nAs no changes are striven for the breeding methods used among other breeds to achieve them, like incest, inbreeding or linebreeding, are practically non-existent. These methods are seriously frowned upon among hortaya breeders. It is extremely rare that ancestors appear twice among the first 4-6 generations of a pedigree. In fact, hortaya breeders try hard to achieve the farthest possible outcross. This is one important reason why the breed is so healthy in spite of its relatively small population.\nAnother consequence is the application of the breed standard. It does not describe any \"ideal dog\" which should be bred for, as it is with other dog breeds. Instead the hortaya standard is a standard of exclusion: it only and very simply describes the boundaries outside of which a dog would not be considered acceptable. Anything else would be pointless, as it is the active endeavour of hortaya breeders to preserve the large variety of types and sub-types of the breed, which may seem being totally different breeds to the layman.\nAdditionally, with the hortaya it is its hunting ability which is the measure of everything, anything else is quite secondary regarding selection.\nLooking at all this it also becomes clear, why an international acceptance of this breed by the FCI is not regarded as being very desirable by the majority of hortaya aficionados. The breed's breeding practice, its consolidated state and its truly extreme phenotypical diversity do not really fit into the actual breeding and judging practices of today's FCI or of any other major kynological federation. Any international FCI acceptance which would not result in immediate harm to the breed needs major, important groundwork and decades of preparation. Currently the direct and immediate consequence would be the undesirable separation into show and work lines, and into western and original hortaya.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe hortaya is an Asian dog breed, which developed over the centuries in the steppes north of the Black Sea, after spreading slowly from the mountains of Afghanistan westwards. Dogs of this type were bred by various peoples of this region, which extends from modern Ukraine and the south of Russia to the westernmost regions of Kazakhstan. Therefore, it is not possible to attribute this breed to a specific people or country. In the east and southeast of its geographical spread it connects to the oriental rsp. Central Asian sight hounds, while it is considered the link to the western sight hound breeds close to the Polish frontiers.\nIn the year 1951, the USSR laid down the first standard for the breed. Nowadays the Russian Kynological Federation (RKF), the national Russian FCI member association, officially maintains the standard. Currently there exist an estimated 2500-3500 hortaya borzaya worldwide, with less than a few dozen outside of the boundaries of the CIS.\nAn international recognition by the FCI does not exist so far, however the breed is nationally recognized by all FCI member countries within the CIS and by many other middle European nations. In some of these states the studbook is maintained directly by the national member organisation of the FCI, in others the hortaya is registered by specialized hunting dog associations.\nThe owners of these dogs are mostly local hunters, who live in remote, often isolated villages in the steppe. Few of them have any interest in shows. For them the hortaya is a valued co-worker who puts food on the table in winter. In the steppe a good hunting hortaya can be worth as much as a good riding horse.\nThe hortaya borzaya belongs to the extremely rare sight hound breeds, which - up to our modern times - has been selected exclusively on its hunting abilities and qualities.\n\n\n== References ==\nMVDr Marika Stanovoi, Prag, On the Breed Standard\nBiologist & breed judge Lada Ponomareva, Kursk, diverse articles\nDr. Shubina, Moscow, diverse articles\nTariel Gabidzashvili, Moscow, diverse articles\nJan Eduard Chortaj - https://web.archive.org/web/20060622195058/http://chortaj.nigilist.ru/\n\n\n== External links ==\nChortaj.com, an international website about the hortaya borzaya (English, German, Russian)]"}, {"id": 248, "name": "Hovawart", "country": "Germany", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog248", "description": "The Hovawart is a medium to large size German dog breed. The name of the breed means \"an estate guard dog\", which is the original use for the breed. The breed originated in the Black Forest region and was first described in text and paintings in medieval times.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Hovawart is a medium-large dog. Male Hovawarts are  63\u201373 centimetres (25\u201329 in) and females 58\u201365 centimetres (23\u201326 in) at the withers. The weight is approximately 30\u201350 kilograms (66\u2013110 lb). The correct color descriptions are black, black and gold, and blond.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Hovawart is an outstanding watch dog and somewhat reserved towards strangers. They make excellent family dogs as they are completely devoted to their family. They are a working dog breed, and require a consistent and loving yet strict training and meaningful activity throughout their lives.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Thirteenth century ===\nOne of the first documented recordings comes from the year 1210 when the German castle Ordensritterburg was besieged by Slavic invaders. The castle fell and its inhabitants including the lord were slaughtered, however the lord's infant son was saved by one of the castle's Hovawarts. In spite of being wounded itself, the dog dragged the tiny child to a neighbouring castle and thus saved the boy's life. This young boy, Eike von Repkow, grew up to become a legendary figure in the history of German law.  He later published the Sachsenspiegel, the oldest code of law to survive from medieval Germany. Not surprisingly, the Hovawart is mentioned with praise. The Schwabenspiegel, a law text published in 1274 and based on Eike von Repkow's Sachsenspiegel, lists the Hovawart among the dogs you have to replace and pay restitution for if they are killed or stolen.\n\n\n=== Fifteenth century ===\nBy 1473, Heinrich Mynsinger described the Hovawart as one of \"The Five Noble Breeds\" and among its uses listed that it was useful for tracking the robber and miscreant. This along with references to the Hovawart in German law show that it was a readily identifiable breed and held in similar esteem to that of hunting dogs.\n\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\n\nFollowing the medieval period, the popularity of the Hovawart began to decline. Newer breeds such as the German Shepherd Dog slowly replaced the Hovawart as a guard and working dog until it had almost disappeared by the beginning of the twentieth century. Around 1915 a group of enthusiasts decided to try to save the breed. Predominant in this group was the zoologist Kurt Friedrich K\u00f6nig. They started by looking for dogs in the farms of the Black Forest region. K\u00f6nig then started a careful breeding program using these dogs and crossed them with Kuvaszok, Newfoundlands, German Shepherd Dogs, Leonbergers, a Bernese Mountain Dog and an African hunting dog. After much work the group was rewarded in 1922 when the first Hovawart litter was entered into the German Breeding Registry. The enthusiasts continued their work and in 1937 the German Kennel Club officially recognised the Hovawart. All this work was almost undone with the outbreak of the Second World War. Because of their abilities many Hovawarts were used in the German war effort and perished. By 1945 only a few remained.  Enthusiasm for the breed remained and in 1947, Otto Schramm and some fellow enthusiasts in Coburg formed a new club, the Rassezuchtverein f\u00fcr Hovawart-Hunde Coburg which is still in existence today. In 1964 the German Kennel Club recognised the Hovawart as the country's seventh working breed and around this time enthusiasm for the breed started to develop in other countries.\n\n\n== Miscellaneous ==\nThe Hovawart does exceptionally well in search and rescue, tracking and working dog activities. The females are generally lighter in build. In training and especially obedience work the trainer must keep positive reinforcement in mind all the time, as this mountain dog is not as eager to please as many other working dog breeds: it always needs some kind of motivation. It is important to realize that the Hovawart works with people and not for people. They do have the ability to think and act independently. Their guarding instinct for example does not require any real training; it is inherent, as it is what they were bred for. The Hovawart may easily become reluctant if training is built only on punishments.The owner of a Hovawart should ideally have previous experience in owning and training a dog and as such the Hovawart is not usually suitable as a first dog.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nHovawart at Curlie"}, {"id": 249, "name": "Huntaway", "country": "New Zealand", "type": "", "picture": "dog249", "description": "The Huntaway (also known as a New Zealand Huntaway) is a large, strongly built breed of dog used for general sheep herding tasks in New Zealand, where they originate. They were bred to use their loud, deep bark to drive sheep. \nThe breed is relatively new, dating from the late 19th century, and  distinguished only on working ability. There is no prescribed appearance or lineage but they are usually black and tan coloured. Only dogs that win at trials may be registered by the New Zealand Sheep Dog Trial Association in their studbook.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nHuntaways are large, deep-chested dogs that generally weigh in the region of 25\u201345 kilograms (55\u201399 lb). Their coats can vary in colour; colours include black, black and tan (usually) with some white or brindle. Their coats can also come in different textures; they can be smooth, rough, or grizzly and they are generally floppy eared. A huntaway\u2019s height is usually in the range of 56\u201366 centimetres (22\u201326 in).\n\n\n== Skills ==\nThey are required to have great intelligence, agility and stamina for days of working on steep, rough country over large distances, driving very large mobs of sheep. Their bark is deep and repeating, usually with a short pause between barks, which allows the barking to be sustained for very long periods.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe huntaway was developed as a breed in response to farming conditions found in the New Zealand high country. The vast pastoral runs or \"stations\", such as those in the high country of the South Island, required teams of dogs who could work mustering for days on end, covering great distances on rough steep country. High country stations typically cover many thousands of hectares, and were often unfenced. British sheepdogs used by early New Zealand farmers mostly worked sheep silently, but occasionally a dog would use its bark to herd sheep. This characteristic was liked by some farmers, especially for driving sheep on rough, steep hill country where a dog may disappear from view, making a dog that drives stock by sight less useful. Collies and other working sheepdogs with the barking trait would have been crossed with any other breed that had other desirable traits, including size, stamina and a steady barking ability, as these are the traits that differentiate the huntaway from the heading dog today, but the exact lineage is not known.The earliest references to huntaways are in the late 19th century. A sheepdog trial with a specific class for huntaways was advertised in the Upper Waitaki in 1870. \"Wanted\" advertisements for \"huntaway sheepdogs\" were in the Otago Daily Times newspaper in 1884, heading and huntaway collies were advertised for sale in 1885.\nThe huntaway was further developed as a separate breed from the heading dog during the 20th century.\n\n\n== Breed recognition ==\nAs of August 2013 the Huntaway breed was recognised by the New Zealand Kennel Club (NZKC). This is the first recognition of a dog breed of New Zealand origin.  There is an NZKC standard for the Huntaway breed, but the standard notes:\n\nIt is the opinion of the New Zealand Sheepdog Trial Association that a Huntaway should never be shown, due to the large variance in colour, type and size and the inability to prove in a show ring their core (and only) task of working stock. It is the opinion of the New Zealand Sheepdog Trial Association that a New Zealand Huntaway should not be kept solely as a pet. No changes to the official breed standard of the New Zealand Huntaway will be made without consultation with the New Zealand Sheepdog Trial Association.\n\n\n== General information ==\nHuntaways generally live to around 12 to 14 years of age. They are generally very healthy, but some inheritable diseases have been identified. They are intelligent, friendly, very energetic, active dogs that require a lot of exercise. They have been bred to muster in the hills and mountains of New Zealand where it is difficult to walk or ride, so worded commands and whistles are used to communicate commands to these dogs when they are at a distance. They are well known for being a noisy dog, especially when working.They are becoming increasingly popular worldwide with a New Zealand Huntaway Club started in Japan and huntaways being bred and used in Australia for work and yard dog trials.\nHunterville in the North Island of New Zealand is known for its statue of a Huntaway.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGeneral Huntaway Information\nHuntaway Club UK"}, {"id": 250, "name": "Hygenhund", "country": "Norway", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog250", "description": "A Hygen Hound (Hygenhund) is a Norwegian breed of dog from the hound group, created in the 19th century by Norwegian breeder Hygen from various other hound breeds. The Hygen Hound is an endurance hunter who can traverse arctic terrain for long periods of time without fatigue.\n\n\n== Conformation ==\nThe Hygen Hound stands approximately 19 to 24 inches (48 to 61 cm) high and weighs around 44 to 55 pounds (20 to 25 kg). They have a thick, shiny coat with straight hairs. They can be found in yellow and red, chestnut (with or without black shading) and black with bright chestnut colors, sometimes combined with white markings.\nTheir heads are triangular, with a broad skull and dark eyes. The ears are wide, the muzzle medium-sized and the neck long and clean. They have level toplines and a solid, compact body. The legs are solid and muscular and the feet compact, and they move in a well-balanced, reaching motion. The tail is carried high, but not curled over the back.

There are two hair types of the breed: smooth and wire. The more commonly seen type is the smooth. Some consider there to be a third type, long, but the longhair is most likely a variation of the wire.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Ibizan Hound is an elegant and agile breed, with an athletic and attractive outline and a ground-covering springy trot. Though graceful in appearance, it has good bone girth and is a rugged/hardy breed. Its large upright ears - a hallmark of the breed - are broad at the base and frame a long and elegant headpiece. The neck is long and lean. It has a unique front assembly with well laid-back shoulders and relatively straight upper arm. Coming in both smooth and wire-coated varieties, their coat is a combination of red and white with the nose, ears, eye rims, and pads of feet being a light tan color. Its eyes are a striking amber color and have an alert and intelligent expression. The Ibizan may range in height, depending on which Standard you follow, from 22 to 29 inches (56 to 74 cm) and weigh from 45 to 65 pounds (20 to 29 kg), males being larger than females.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nIbizan Hounds are intelligent, active, and engaging by nature. They rank 53rd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of average working/obedience intelligence, but many Ibizan owners will enjoy recounting a multitude of examples of their problem-solving abilities. They are true \"clowns\" of the dog world, delighting in entertaining their people with their antics. Though somewhat independent and stubborn at times, they do take well to training if positive methods are used, but will balk at punitive training methods. They are generally quiet, but will alarm bark if necessary, so they make good watch dogs. They are sensitive hounds, and very good around children and other dogs alike. They generally make good house dogs, but are active and athletic, therefore need a lot of daily exercise. They do not make good kennel dogs. Ibizan hounds are sweet, but they are very stubborn and independent.\nIbizan Hounds are \"escapologists\": they are able to jump incredible heights from a standstill, so they need very tall fences. They also have been known to climb, and many can escape from crates, open baby gates and even locks. They have a strong prey drive, therefore they cannot be trusted off leash unless in a safely enclosed area. Once off the leash, they might not come back for a long time. A hound that knows where its home is and the surrounding area will usually return unscathed.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Ibizan Hound is typical of the Hound Group in that it rarely suffers from hereditary illness. Minor health concerns for the breed include seizures and allergies; very rarely, one will see axonal dystrophy, cataract, retinal dysplasia and deafness in the breed. Ibizan Hound owners should have their dogs' eyes tested by a veterinarian before breeding. CERF and BAER testing is recommended for the breed.  Ibizan Hounds are sensitive to barbiturate anesthesia, and typically live between 12 and 14 years.\n\n\n== History and use ==\n\nThis breed originates in the island of Eivissa and has been traditionally used in the Catalan-speaking areas of Spain, and France where it was known under the name of le charnigue, to hunt rabbits and other small game. The Ibizan Hound is a fast dog that can hunt on all types of terrain, working by scent, sound and sight. Hunters run these dogs in mostly female packs, with perhaps a male or two, as the female is considered the better hunter.\nTraditionally a farmer may have one dog and a very well off farmer two dogs to catch rabbits for food. However in the last twenty years it is seen as a sport where between five and fifteen dogs can be seen in the chase of one rabbit.\nThe Ibizan Hound authority Miquel Rossell\u00f3 has provided a detailed description of a working trial which characterises their typical hunting technique and action, strikingly illustrated with action photos by Charles Camberoque which demonstrate hunt behaviour and typical hunt terrain. \nWhile local hunters will at times use one dog or a brace, and frequently packs of six to eight or as many as fifteen, the working trial requires an evaluation of one or two braces. A brace is called a colla. The couples should be tested on at least two to five rabbits (not hares), without the use of any other hunting aid. An inspection and evaluation of the exterior, fitness, character and obedience of the dogs is recommended prior to the hunt. \nThe trial is qualified as having 5 parts. The dogs should show: (1) careful tracking and scenting of the rabbit, without being distracted in the least, 0-30 points; (2) correct signalling of the game, patient stand, strong jump into the air, obedience 0-10 points; (3) chase, giving tongue, speed, sureness, anticipation 0-30 points; (4) putting the game to cover at close quarters, listening, waiting, obedience, correct attack 0-10 point; and (5) good catch, or correct indication of the game\u2019s location, retrieval, obedience 0-20 points.\nIndividual dogs are expected to show a great degree of discipline, obedience and co-operation. They should be extremely agile, have good speed and a powerful vertical jump from a stationary position in rough and often heavily covered ground. They should have excellent scent-tracking abilities, give tongue at the right time when approaching the game closely, and otherwise be silent so that they can locate the game by sound.\nThe Ibizan Hound is similar in function and type to several breeds, such as the Pharaoh Hound, the Cirneco dell'Etna, the Portuguese Podengo, and the Podenco Canario. The Ibizan Hound is the largest of these breeds, classified by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale as primitive types.\nIt is believed the Ibizan Hound evolves from the tesem, the ancient Egyptian hunting dog. Representations of this dog on the walls of ancient tombs show a striking similarity to the modern Ibizan Hound. These dogs would have been brought to the island of Eivissa by the Phoenicians, who founded settlements there as early as the 8th century BC. A recent DNA analysis found that the breed was formed recently from other breeds. \nA more recent article \nargues that continued trait selective breeding may be behind this lack of support.\nIn the United States, the Ibizan Hound is frequently competed in lure coursing through the AKC and ASFA, and also competes in LGRA straight racing and NOTRA oval track racing.  Some parts of the country also use them for coursing live prey, generally jackrabbits.\nThe Ibizan Hound breed is recognized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, Continental Kennel Club, American Kennel Club, United Kennel Club, Kennel Club of Great Britain, Canadian Kennel Club, National Kennel Club, New Zealand Kennel Club, Australian National Kennel Council, America's Pet Registry, and American Canine Registry. It was fully recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1979.\n\n\n== In folk culture ==\nAccording to journalist Norman Lewis, when an owner no longer wants to own one of these dogs (having too much of an appetite, for instance), it is considered very bad luck to kill the dog. Instead, they release the dog on the other side of the island, so that someone else might 'adopt' the animal.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSighthound Sanctuary & Animal Services\nIbizan Hound Photos\nCharles Camberoque: photos of Ibizans at work\nVideo: How Ibizans hunt\nIbizan Hound Club (Eivissa)\nNorwegian Ibizan Hound Club\nSwiss Ibizan Hound Club\nGerman Ibizan Hound Club\nIbizan Hound Rescue in Spain\nIbizan Hounds in the UK\nAdditional information on the German language Wikipedia.(In German: \"Podenco Ibicenco\")"}, {"id": 252, "name": "Icelandic Sheepdog", "country": "Iceland", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog252", "description": "The Icelandic Sheepdog  is a breed of dog of spitz type originating from the dogs brought to Iceland by the Vikings.

Hardy and agile, they are extremely useful for herding and driving livestock or finding lost sheep. However, the dogs are not known for hunting. They are very alert and always give visitors an enthusiastic welcome, without being aggressive. Friendly and cheerful, the Icelandic Sheepdog is inquisitive, playful, and unafraid. They generally get along well with children, as well as other pets.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nIcelandic Sheepdogs can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, rally obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Icelandic Sheepdogs that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Icelandic Sheepdog very much resembles dogs found in graves in Denmark and Sweden from about 8000 BC. Dog imports to Iceland were limited and from 1901 even forbidden.\nIn 1650, Sir Thomas Brown wrote, \"To England there are sometimes exported from Iceland ... a type of dog resembling a fox ... Shepherds in England are eager to acquire them!\"\nPlague and canine distemper destroyed over 75% of the breed in the late 19th century, leading to a ban on the importation of dogs to Iceland. The purebred Icelandic Sheepdog was again bordering extinction in the late 20th century and in 1969, the Icelandic Dog Breeder Association (HRF\u00cd) was established to preserve the breed, among other aims.\nThe Icelandic Sheepdog gained AKC recognition in June 2010, alongside the Leonberger and the Cane Corso.\n\n\n== Miscellaneous ==\nThe breed is sometimes denoted in Latin as canis islandicus, though it is a breed and not a species.\n\nAs the name implies, it is a sheep dog, but is also used as a watch dog and general working dog. When herding, the Icelandic Sheepdogs were not mainly used to take the sheep from one point to another, but to prevent animals from straying. Additionally, the dogs were in charge of herding horses and other animals, as well. When herding failed, the dogs drove the animals by barking. Thus, they tend to bark when they want something, although this behaviour can be controlled by training.\nIn the Icelandic landscape, sheep often get lost and it has historically been the dog's job to find them and return them to the herd. They are, therefore, used to working on their own and to figuring things out for themselves, so owners have to beware lest they learn things they should not. As a watch dog, their main task was to alert the inhabitants when somebody was coming, so these dogs tend to bark a lot when they see people approaching.\nThe Icelandic Sheepdog is very loyal and wants to be around its family constantly. It follows its owner everywhere. Unlike most working dogs, these calm down when indoors and happily lie down at their master's feet.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIcelandic Sheepdog at Curlie"}, {"id": 253, "name": "Indian pariah dog", "country": "India", "type": "", "picture": "dog253", "description": "The Indian pariah dog or Indian native dog (Canis lupus familiaris) is the aboriginal landrace of the Indian sub-continent.

It is popularly known as Desi dog, and an Indi-dog or In-dog (in various spellings).\nThis breed is known as \"naadan\"(\u0d28\u0d3e\u0d1f\u0d7b) in Malayalam (Kerala).\nThis breed is called as \"naatu naai\"(country dogs) in Tamil (Tamil Nadu)\nIn Bengali they are named as \"Neri Kukur\" (\u09a8\u09c7\u09a1\u09bc\u09bf \u0995\u09c1\u0995\u09c1\u09b0). In Himachali they are named as \"luru\".

It was featured on National Geographic Channel's film, Search for the First Dog along with the other related ancient types such as the Canaan Dog of Israel and the Australian dingo. It was introduced to the Andaman Islands with the establishment of a penal colony there, dogs having been previously unknown to the native Andamanese.A breed standard exists with the Indian Kennel Club, and the dog has been recognized by the Primitive and Aboriginal Dog Society (PADS), a worldwide grouping of enthusiasts based in the USA.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nPariah dogs are extremely alert and social. Their rural evolution, often close to forests where predators like tigers and leopards were common, have made them an extremely cautious breed, commonly mistaken for a lack of courage. They make excellent watch dogs and are very territorial and defensive of their pack/family. They need good socializing as pups and do well with families and children if provided with such socialization. They are highly intelligent and easily trainable, but can get bored equally easily, not wanting to play typical, repetitive dog games such as fetch.They are modest eaters and rarely overeat and are a very active breed, thriving on regular exercise. They bark at the slightest doubt or provocation.\n\n\n== Health ==\nBeing a naturally evolved breed, they have very few health concerns and thrive with minimal \"maintenance\", especially in tropical weather. The skin needs very little grooming and the dogs themselves are relatively clean. They have no body odour. Genetic health ailments like hip dysplasia and so on are extremely rare since there is no inbreeding and the dominant genes that aid their survival are naturally selected over time. Most of the deaths in these dogs occur due to accidents on the roads and railway tracks, tumors in the body or being beaten up by humans.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nIt is a medium-sized dog of square to slightly rectangular build and short coat. The dog has a double coat, a coarse upper coat and a soft undercoat. The most commonly observed colours are browns, ranging from dark to reddish-brown, with or without white markings. Solid blacks are rare, but some dogs are pied. Shaded coats, brindles, solid white and dalmatian-type spotting are never seen in pure populations. These may be a sign of mixing with modern breeds, as they are only seen in dogs in cities and other sites where non-native dogs have been introduced.The head is medium-sized and wedge-shaped. The muzzle is pointed and is of equal or slightly greater length than the head. The neck is noble and the forequarters are erect. Hindquarters are minimally angled. The trot is short. The eyes are almond-shaped and dark brown in colour. The ears are held erect and are pointed at the tips, with a broad base, set low on the head, and the tail is curled and held high when excited.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCanaan dog\nNew Guinea singing dog\nDingo\nAfricanis\nCarolina Dog (Yellow Dog)\nBasenji\nTelomian\nSinhala Hound\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nINDog: The Indian Pariah Dog, at InDog.co.in\nPrimitive & Aboriginal Dog Society"}, {"id": 254, "name": "Indian Spitz", "country": "India", "type": "", "picture": "dog254", "description": "The Indian Spitz is a spitz-type dog breed belonging to the Utility Dog group. It is very similar to the German Spitz in appearance but is roughly 1.5-2.5 inches shorter at the withers and weighs around 10-15 lbs less.\nThe Indian Spitz was one of the most popular dogs in India in the 1980s and the 1990s when India's import rules made it very difficult to import dogs of other breeds.\nThe Indian Spitz is often called Pomeranian though the two breeds are very different. The confusion arises from the fact that both breeds belong to the Spitz family, along with the Elk-Hound, German Spitz, Samoyed, Finnish Spitz, and many others.\nThe Indian Spitz was introduced in India by the British who began breeding them from a stock of German Spitzes. Years of breeding produced the ideal dog type which was suited to the plains of India and was capable of withstanding India's sultry climate. These Spitzes resembled Samoyeds and German Spitzes but had less thick coats and were smaller in size, which was ideal for the conditions.\nThough they are not recognized by any major Kennel Club, The Indian Spitz is identified as a separate Indian Breed by the Kennel Club of India. It has now been working to establish the Indian Spitz as a separate breed at other Kennel Clubs around the world.\nGenerally Indian Spitzes are divided into two: the Smaller Indian Spitz/Lesser Indian Spitz (Roughly 5\u20137 kg [11\u201315 lb] in weight and 22\u201325 cm [8 1\u20442\u201310 in] at the withers) and the Greater Indian Spitz (Roughly 12\u201320 kg (26\u201344 lb) in weight and 35\u201345 cm (14\u201317 1\u20442 in) at the withers). The Indian Spitz is generally Milky White but can also be found in solid colours like Black, Dusky Brown and sometimes (very rarely) a hybrid of black and white (similar to the Dalmatian).\nMost have a lifespan between 10 and 14 years; however some have been known to live up to 16 years of age.\n\n\n== Behavior ==\nThe Indian Spitz is an extremely bright and active dog breed. It is adaptable to living in a small apartment, but it can also thrive in a large farmhouse with equal ease. It is also counted among one of the most intelligent dog breeds. It can easily learn various tricks in less than the average time, and has a unique ability to understand human intentions. Its diet is also extremely adaptable and can include anything from milk, rice and yogurt to a diet of rice and chicken.\n\n\n== Differences between the Pomeranian and Indian Spitz ==\nThe Pomeranian is a toy breed. It is much lighter than even a Lesser Indian Spitz, both in height and weight, which typically weighs less than 10 pounds and is rarely over 12 inches in height.\nThe Pomeranian has a much flatter face than an Indian Spitz, which has a more conical snout.\nThe coat of a Pomeranian is generally much denser and thicker. It is often difficult to see individual hairs. However, an Indian Spitz's coat is much less dense and it is much easier to see the individual hair follicles.\nThe Pomeranian's ears are generally not as pointed or elongated as that of an Indian Spitz.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Indian Spitz\nKennel Club of India"}, {"id": 255, "name": "Irish Red and White Setter", "country": "Ireland", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog255", "description": "The Irish Red and White Setter (Irish: An Sotar Rua agus B\u00e1n) is a breed of dog. As with all setters, it is classified as a gundog in the UK and is included in the sporting group in America and Canada. It is virtually identical in use and temperament to the related Irish Setter, as well as the Gordon and English setters, but is more often found as a working gun dog.\nThe original purpose of the breed was to hunt gamebirds. In the UK, their quarry can be partridge or grouse, pheasant, ptarmigan, blackgame, snipe or woodcock as all these birds try to avoid predators by hiding rather than flying away. Overseas, they may be used to hunt quail, willow grouse, sand grouse, guinea fowl, sagehen, francolin.\nDespite the breed's early origins, it had almost became extinct at the end of the 19th century. During the 1920s, dedicated breeders managed to revive interest and restore the Irish Red and White setter to a viable position. It is still considered a vulnerable breed, but has gained recognition from all major kennel clubs.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe function of setters is to find and locate game by quartering ground as it searches for the scent carried in the wind by birds such as grouse, partridge, pheasant or snipe. It is fast and wide-ranging. As it gallops in its quest to seek scent, its head is carried high. Once it locates the birds, it will freeze on point or \"set\" indicating to its handler where the birds are hiding. It may slightly crouch but its position will remain tense, immobile and rigid. The dog's head will remain raised as it savours the airborne scent and it intently stares in the direction of where the birds are hiding. Its tail will be held level with its back. Setters literally show the hunters exactly where the birds are.The breed is classified in the Gundog Group by the Kennel Club in the U.K. and in the Sporting Group by the American and Canadian Kennel Clubs. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) classify the breed in Group 7 (Pointing dogs), Section 2 (British and Irish Pointers and Setters).The Irish Red and White Setter still has an ingrained natural working ability, so when correctly trained and given the appropriate opportunity, it will work well performing its original function.They can take longer to train than other gun dogs, but once trained, they are loyal and reliable companions. They need firm and decisive, but not harsh, training.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n'Setting dogges' \u2013 an ancient term for setters, were developed to indicate the whereabouts of game birds, and would have been used in Roman times. The dog would find the location of the game birds by scenting the air, freeze in either a standing or crouching position, then slowly creep forward on command to disturb the birds into flight. Once the birds were in flight the hunter who had been following the dog would release hawks to capture the birds in the air. When netting superseded the use of hawks, setting dogs would still be used to indicate the whereabouts of the birds, but the hunter would come up behind the dog and throw a net over the birds. In the mid-1600s, guns became more readily available and shooting game birds became a popular pastime of the landed gentry. The basic work of setters was still to find and point to the location of game birds but it also had to be steady to shot.\n\nBy the 17th century 'setting dogges' had become established and the breeds as seen in the present day could be identified as Setters. Interbreeding of differently coloured dogs was still taking place during this period, but this gradually changed and sportsmen started to limit matings to dogs adapted to the terrain they were required to cover.Originally, setters in Ireland were mostly red, or the parti-colour red and white, or even mostly white dogs. All were accepted as Irish Setters and were mated to each other.As late as 1875 at a conformation show in Dublin, there were 66 entries in the Irish Setter classes; 23 of these entries were red and white. At a show in Cork the next year, out of 96 entries, there were 36 red and white animals. This was when the fashion for solid red-coloured setters began, leading to a decline in red and white setter numbers. The popularity of the solid red Irish Setter in both America and Ireland gained strength as they attracted very high prices, all adding to the demise of the Irish Red and White almost to the point of extinction. A handful of breeders in remote parts of Ireland kept the breed alive.A small number of breeders were active from 1775 to the end of the 19th century. The Rossmore family of County Monaghan in Ireland, had a strain of red and white setters dating back to the mid 18th century and this line was preserved into the 20th century. The family still own many paintings of these dogs. During the breed's history, red and white setters were sometimes referred to as Rossmore Setters. Other owners recorded at this time included Reverend Mahon of Castlegar, Yelverton O'Keefe, Maurice Nugent O'Connor and Miss Lidwell whose name was sometimes misspelt as Ledwich. The dogs from these strains were all particularly known for their working abilities.\n\n\n=== Revival ===\n \nUpon returning from the Great War, Irish clergyman Noble Huston attempted a revival of the breed, but despite this, numbers on the island of Ireland remained small. From around 1970, a revival of the breed was planned, and the numbers began to increase slowly. The Irish Kennel Club approached the Irish Red Setter Club during 1976 to ask if it was willing to help oversee the revival of the Irish Red and White Setter.Partly through the endeavours of the Irish Red and White Setter Field & Show Society, which was formed in 1981, the breed became well established and received national and international recognition. Irish Red and White Setters successfully compete in conformation shows and field trials, attaining champions in both disciplines.Many individuals contributed to the breed's successful revival. Rev. Huston kept a note of his litters in the parish register. He did not have official pedigrees but did engage in lengthy correspondence with Maureen Cuddy (then Clarke), whose kennel name was 'Knockalla\". In a letter to Cuddy, Rev. Huston wrote: \"...the present Red and Whites are not a new breed nor a revived breed (like the Irish Wolfhound) but a continued breed...\" It was through Cuddy's meticulous record keeping and research that in 1974 the Irish Kennel Club finally accepted that the pedigrees of the few remaining Irish Red and Whites were accurate.It is likely that the revived generations of Irish Red and White Setters descend from a puppy bitch Cuddy nursed to health in 1940. This bitch was named Judith Cunningham of Knockalla.By the 1980s, Irish Red and White Setters were being imported into Great Britain, where the breed was developed more as a show dog. Interest in Great Britain had particularly been revived after Alan and Ann Gormley from Dublin exhibited an Irish Red and White at Crufts in 1980. This was Harlequin of Knockalla who was bred by Cuddy in 1977. Harlequin had qualified for Crufts due to his success at shows in Ireland, but the Gormleys were more interested in showing their dogs than in working them. Harlequin did prove he could work while young, but an error with the paperwork meant his qualifying test at a field trial was never correctly recorded. Harlequin was sired by Glenkeen Sandy whose grandfather was Sulhamstead Natty D'Or, a field trial dog bred by Florence Nagle.The breed was little known in Britain and the Kennel Club had inadvertently listed Harlequin's Crufts entry among the Irish Setters. This was the trigger for great interest in the breed, as it proved the breed was not extinct as was believed.Irish Red and White Setters bred by the Gormleys under their kennel name of 'Meudon' proved influential worldwide as their Red and Whites were exported to Italy, America and Holland, as well as to the UK.In contrast to these British dogs, the breed has continued to be primarily a working and field trial dog in Ireland.From 1 January 2009, the Irish Red and White Setter was fully recognised by the American Kennel Club (AKC), and was eligible to compete in conformation and all other competitive fields. The breed had previously been listed on the AKC Foundation Stock Service, which is the first step towards a purebred breed gaining recognition in America. The breed was given recognition by the Canadian Kennel Club in May 1999.The breed is recognised by most other national Kennel Clubs. All registered Irish Red and White Setters are the descendants of the dogs accepted by the Irish Kennel Club at the time of the revival of the breed in the 1970s.\nIt is listed by the Kennel Club in the UK as a Vulnerable Native Breed, due to registration numbers of less than 300 per year.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Irish Red and White Setter should have an aristocratic, well proportioned, balanced appearance yet still be strong and powerful without lumber or coarseness. It does not have the racy appearance of its solid red-coloured cousin, as the Red and White Setter is heavier in body, has a broader head and the peak at the back of his skull is less peaked. They are athletic, keen and intelligent.The head and body coat is short and flat with long silky fringes \u2013 usually these fringes are called 'feathering'. The feathering forms a fringe on the outside of the ears, neck, chest, down the back of the front legs, under the belly and on the back legs. The tail is also feathered with long coat. The body coat and feathering should be straight and flat but not profuse and never curly.There are subtle differences between each of the setter breeds. However, one of the main distinguishing features between the setter breeds is colour. As the breed name implies, Irish Red and White Setters must be red and white, and it is an important feature of the breed.The base colour is a pearly white and there should be solid patches of deep-red. The red colour can be likened to a freshly opened chestnut and should not be light red or gingerish. The face, feet, front and lower hind legs are allowed some mottling or flecking but it must not extend to other areas of the body coat.Irish Red and White Setters should be combed and well brushed each week to keep the coat well groomed. Any wispy hair on feet should be trimmed away regularly and bushy hair behind ears should be thinned. They should only need to be bathed when necessary as they are easy to keep clean due to the single coat not being too thick. Irish Red and White Setters do not require as much trimming for presentation in conformation shows as the other setters, because they have lighter coats.The FCI give desired heights of 22.5 to 24 inches (57 to 61 cm) in females and 24.5 to 26 inches (62 to 66 cm) in males, with no stated weight restrictions, while the American KC states that females range in height from 22.5 to 24 inches (57 to 61 cm), and males from 24 to 26 inches (61 to 66 cm), with a weight around 50 to 70 lb (23 to 32 kg). No specific height or weight is given in the Kennel Club breed standard but males can be up to 27 inches (69 cm) and weigh around 70 lb (32 kg). The height is taken from where the dog's neck joins the back (the withers) measured down to the ground.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Irish Red and White Setter can be the most devoted and affectionate of dogs making them ideal all-round family dogs. They are extremely intelligent and respond well to proper training but they do need to have plenty to occupy them. They thrive best in active families, where they have outlets for their high energy, and require space to run freely. Young puppies do not require much exercise but once they reach maturity the breed's working instincts mean they require enough space to be able to run hard and fast for a long distance. Setters are usually good natured, very gentle and get on well with children and other dogs.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n=== Hereditary concerns ===\n\nIrish Red and White Setters are generally a healthy breed. However, there are three known diseases in the breed which are monitored by the breed clubs.These are:\n\nCanine Leucocyte Adhesion Deficiency (CLAD) \u2013 a failure of the immune system to fight infection. Young puppies do not thrive and continually pick up infections. They can also have growth problems and may die well before they reach their first birthday. The Kennel Club has only registered Irish Red and White Setters that are proven clear of the CLAD mutation, either by direct DNA testing or by virtue of having parents that are proven to be clear of the CLAD mutation (i.e. hereditarily clear). No carriers can be registered. This ruling came into effect on 17 June 2008;\nvon Willebrands Disease (vWD) \u2013 a failure of the blood to clot over a wound, which in extreme cases, the dog can bleed to death with only a small wound, if unattended. The Kennel Club will only register litters of Irish Red and White Setters if both parents are DNA tested clear of the von Willebrand Disease (vWD) mutation, or are hereditarily clear of this mutation. This ruling came into effect on 1 January 2011;\nand Posterior Polar Cataract (PPC) \u2013 sight is impaired by a cataract on the back of the lens of the eye.Because of breeders' proactive approach, in the UK the number of affected dogs have been kept low and CLAD and vWD are \"virtually unheard of in the breed today\".In 2004, the UK Kennel Club established the Accredited Breeders Scheme, which was later called the Assured Breeders scheme (ABS). The scheme received UKAS accreditation in April 2013. ABS members are required to adhere to additional criteria than those necessary for basic KC registration. Among the extra requirements is \"Ensuring that the parents of each litter are readily identifiable by either Microchip, Tattoo or DNA profile.\" As at March 2013, breeders of Irish Red and White Setters who are members of the ABS must continue to use screening systems for eye testings and DNA checks for vWD and CLAD. It also advises screening for hip dysplasia.Irish Red and White Setters have an average lifespan of 10 to 12 years.\n\n\n=== Outcross programme ===\n\nIn an attempt to address the possibility of a very restricted gene pool, the Irish Kennel Club (IKC) announced in 2011 that it was to instigate a programme of allowing Irish Red and White Setters to be crossed with Irish Setters. Any such outcross matings were to be carefully monitored. The programme was supported by the Irish Red and White Setter Club of Ireland, the Irish Red Setter Club (Ireland) and other national Kennel Clubs. The IKC felt there was a high degree of inbreeding within ten generations of Irish Red and White setters and wished to increase the genetic diversity of the breed to prevent genetic problems arising from close inbreeding. It considered that the genes of the working lines of Irish Setters were very similar to those of the Irish Red and White setters and their close ancestry had already been used to aid the revival of the Irish Red and White setter. Before any outcross matings could take place, the mating would have to be approved by the official Outcross Committee. Only dogs with current health tests would be considered.However, the programme was met with dismay by many other breed clubs worldwide who felt it was a flawed and disappointing decision. An official of the Canadian breed club said: \"we cannot condone the crossbreeding of our essentially healthy IRWS breed with dogs of a breed which is known to hold, by various unknown modes of inheritance, far more genetic detritus than ours.\" The Irish Red and White Setter Club of GB felt the outcross was not desirable nor necessary. Despite such criticism, some breed clubs have chosen to take part in the programme.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHunting dog\nPointing breed\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n\n== External links ==\nIrish Red and White Setter Pedigree Collection"}, {"id": 256, "name": "Irish Setter", "country": "Ireland", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog256", "description": "The Irish Setter (Irish: sotar rua, literally \"red setter\") is a setter, a breed of gundog, and family dog. The term Irish Setter is commonly used to encompass the show-bred dog recognised by the American Kennel Club as well as the field-bred Red Setter recognised by the Field Dog Stud Book. \n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe coat is moderately long, silky, and of a red or chestnut color. It requires frequent brushing to maintain its condition and keep it mat-free.  The undercoat is abundant in winter weather, and the top coat is fine. Their coats should also feather in places such as the tail, ears, chest, legs, and body. Irish Setters range in height from 24 to 28 inches (61 to 71 cm), males weigh 65 to 75 lb (29 to 34 kg) and females 55 to 65 lb (25 to 29 kg). The FCI Breed Standard for the Irish Setter stipulates males stand 23 to 26.5 inches (58 to 67 cm) tall, and females be 21.5 to 24.5 inches (55 to 62 cm) tall.\nIrish Setters are deep chested dogs with small waists. An Irish Setter's life expectancy tends to be around 11 to 12 years.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nIrish Setters get along well with children, other dogs, and will enthusiastically greet visitors.  Even though they do well with household pets, small animals may pose a problem for this breed, as they are a hunting breed.  Some Irish Setters may have problems with cats in the house, and may be too rambunctious with small children.  As the FCI, ANKC and UK Standards state, the breed should be \"Demonstrably affectionate.\"  As a result, Irish Setters make excellent companion animals and family pets.Irish Setters are an active breed, and require long, daily walks and off-lead running in wide, open spaces.  They are, however, a breed with a tendency to 'play deaf,' so careful training on mastering the recall should be undertaken before allowing them off-lead.Irish Setters enjoy having a job to do. Lack of activity will lead to a bored, destructive, or even hyperactive dog. This is not a breed that can be left alone in the backyard for long periods of time, nor should they be. Irish Setters thrive on constant human companionship. Irish Setters respond swiftly to positive training and are highly intelligent.Though they are usually alert to their surroundings, Irish Setters are not well-suited as guard dogs, as they are not a naturally assertive breed.Irish Setters are also widely used as therapy dogs in schools and hospitals. Therapy dogs are permitted in hospitals with special permission and can visit patients on the assigned floors. This is a venue where the therapy dogs are permitted in schools and then asked to sit with children as the students read to the Irish Setter. This process helps to enable the student the ability to read without being corrected or judged. Generally the Irish Setter will lie on the floor with the student as the student continues to read, in this calming and relaxed setting.\nIrish Setter\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== History ==\n \nOne of the first references to the 'Setter,' or setting dog, in literature can be found in Caius's De Canibus Britannicus, which was published in 1570 (with a revised version published in 1576).  Translated from the original Latin, the text reads:\n\nThe Dogge called the Setter, in Latine, Index: Another sort of Dogges be there, serviceable for fowling, making no noise either with foote or with tongue, whiles they follow the game.  They attend diligently upon their Master and frame their condition to such beckes, motions and gestures, as it shall please him to exhibite and make, either going forward, drawing backeward, inclinding to the right hand, or yealding toward the left.  When he hath founde the byrde, he keepeth sure and fast silence, he stayeth his steppes and will proceed no further, and weth a close, covert watching eye, layeth his belly to the grounde and so creepth forward like a worme.  When he approaches neere to the place where the byrde is, he layes him downe, and with a marcke of his pawes, betrayeth the place of the byrdes last abode, whereby it is supposed that this kind of dogge is calles in Index, Setter, being in deede a name most consonant and agreeable to his quality.\"\nIt would be incorrect to assume the dog described above in any way resembles the Irish Setter (or any setter) as we know the breed today. Caius was referring to a type of setting spaniel, most likely now extinct. The description of the work undertaken by this early pillar of the breed resembles the working behaviour of modern Irish Setters. Of this early dog, Caius went on to write: \"The most part of theyre skinnes are white, and if they are marcked with any spottes, they are commonly red, and somewhat great therewithall.\" If this is the case, it is safe to assume the solid red colouring of today's Irish Setter came about by selective breeding practices.\nFurther reference to setters in early literature can be found in The Country Farme by Surflet and Markham, published in 1616.  They wrote: \"There is also another sort of land spannyels which are called Setters.\"It is clear that, by the early 18th Century, the type of dog known as the 'setter' had come into its own right. It is also clear the Irish had begun actively breeding their own type. For example, the de Freyne family of French Park began keeping detailed stud records in 1793. Other prominent landed Irish gentry also known to have been breeding setter lines at the same time include Lord Clancarty, Lord Dillon, and the Marquis of Waterford.\nIt was noted as early as 1845 that setters in Ireland were predominantly either red, or, according to Youatt, \"...very red, or red and white, or lemon coloured, or white patched with deep chestnut.\" Clearly, the preference for a solid red-coloured dog was having an effect on the appearance of the typical Irish-bred setter.\nThe breed standard for the modern Irish Setter was first drawn up by the Irish Red Setter Club in Dublin and approved on 29 March 1886. It consisted of a 100-point scale, with a given number of points awarded for each of the dog's physical attributes. The points system was later dropped; however, aside from some minor changes, the standard remains largely unchanged today in most countries where the breed is formally recognised.\n\nHistory\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Uses ==\n\nThe Irish Setter was bred for hunting, specifically for setting or locating and pointing upland gamebirds. They are a tireless, wide-ranging hunter, and well-suited to fields and wet or dry moorland terrain. Using their excellent sense of smell to locate the mark (or bird), the Irish Setter will then hold a pointing position, indicating the direction in which the bird lies hidden.\nThe Irish Setter was brought to the United States in the early 19th century.\nIn 1874, the American Field put together the Field Dog Stud Book and registry of dogs in the United States was born. The FDSB is the oldest pure-bred registry in the United States. At that time, dogs could be registered even when bred from sires and dams of different breeds. At about this time, the Llewellin Setter was bred using blood lines from the Lavarack breeding of English Setter and, among other breeds, bloodlines from native Irish Setters. Around the same time, the red Irish Setter became a favourite in the dog show ring.\nThe Irish Setter of the late 19th century was not just a red dog. The AKC registered Irish Setters in a myriad of colours. Frank Forester, a 19th-century sports writer, described the Irish Setter as follows: \"The points of the Irish Setter are more bony, angular, and wiry frame, a longer head, a less silky and straighter coat that those of the English. His colour ought to be a deep orange-red and white, a common mark is a stripe of white between the eyes and a white ring around the neck, white stockings, and a white tage to the tail.\"\nThe Setter that was completely red, however, was preferred in the show ring and that is the direction that the breed took. Between 1874 and 1948, the breed produced 760 conformation show champions, but only five field champions.\nIn the 1940s, Field and Stream magazine put into writing what was already a well-known fact. The Irish Setter was disappearing from the field and an outcross would be necessary to resurrect the breed as a working dog. Sports Afield chimed in with a similar call for an outcross. Ned LaGrande of Pennsylvania spent a small fortune purchasing examples of the last of the working Irish Setters in America and importing dogs from overseas. With the blessing of the Field Dog Stud Book, he began an outcross to red and white field champion English Setters. The National Red Setter Field Trial Club was created to test the dogs and to encourage breeding toward a dog that would successfully compete with the white setters. Thus the modern Red Setter was born and the controversy begun.\nPrior to 1975, a relationship existed between the AKC and the Field Dog Stud book in which registration with one body qualified a dog for registration with the other. In 1975 the Irish Setter Club of America petitioned the AKC to deny reciprocal registration, and the AKC granted the request. It is claimed, by critics of the move, that the pressure was placed on the AKC by bench show enthusiasts who were unappreciative of the outcrossing efforts of the National Red Setter Field Trial Club, as well as some AKC field trialers following a series of losses to FDSB red setters. Working Irish Setter kennels today field champion dogs that claim lines from both the FDSB dogs and AKC dogs.\n\nIrish Setter\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Working Red Setter ===\nThe modern Red Setter is smaller than its bench-bred cousin. While show dogs often reach 70 lb (32 kg), the Working Red Setter is generally around 45 lb (20 kg). The coat is less silky and the feathering is generally shorter. The colour is lighter, with the working dog found in russet and fawn colours. The Red Setter often has patches of white on its face and chest as the Irish Setter of old did. There have been efforts to rekindle the field abilities of the true type Irish by a handful of dedicated breeders in California and elsewhere with some success.  More than a dozen AKC Dual Champion Irish Setters have been made, evidence of the dog's native ability when proper traits are selectively sought in breeding.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIrish Setters tend to be a relatively healthy breed. Problems that have been noted in Irish Setters include\nhip dysplasia, cancer, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), epilepsy, entropion, hypothyroidism, hyperosteodystrophy, gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), osteosarcoma, Von Willebrand's disease, patent ductus arteriosus, canine Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (CLAD) and celiac disease.\nIrish Setters are now one of the few breeds for which genetic tests have been developed to detect the presence of both CLAD and PRA (RCD-1).\nGluten intolerance in Irish Setters is a naturally occurring genetic disorder that is the result of a single autosomal recessive locus. At around 6 months of age, Irish Setters with this condition will develop an increased immune cell presence and a decrease in absorption within the small intestine when fed a gluten containing diet. These affects lead to further damage of the small intestine as well as malnutrition and diarrhea. Irish Setters that are fed a gluten free diet have been shown to be exempt from any effects associated with gluten intolerance.\n\n\n== Miscellaneous ==\nBus \u00c9ireann, the national bus company in Ireland, uses the Irish Setter as its corporate logo.\nIn Swedish the Irish Setter is called \u201cIrl\u00e4ndsk R\u00f6d Setter\u201d, translated to Irish Red Setter.\n\n\n== Notable setters ==\n\nAlex the Dog from the Stroh's beer commercials (half Irish Setter, half Golden Retriever)\nBig Red, book and movie character\nChauncey, fictional dog of Duck Phillips in Mad Men\nGarry Owen, pet of Maine Governor Percival Proctor Baxter\nKing Timahoe (1968\u20131979), pet of Richard Nixon, a 56th birthday gift from his White House staff in January 1969.\nKojak, fictional dog in the Stephen King novel The Stand\nMike, pet of US President Harry Truman\nMilord, a red Setter which was Alexander II, Tsar of Russia's favourite dog\nPeggy Brown, a female Irish setter, the pet of Finnish Air Force Fighter Squadron 24 in World War Two\nPlunkett, the only Irish setter depicted in George Earl's mythical painting of \"A Field Trial in the Eighties\"\nShannon, pet of Beach Boy Carl Wilson, whose death became the subject of the 1976 song by a friend, Henry Gross\nT-Bone, mascot for the Pace University Setters sports teams\nThunder, first mascot for the University of British Columbia Thunderbirds sports teams\nSeamus, owned by Mitt Romney.\nRedbeard, owned by younger Sherlock Holmes in Sherlock\nSasha La Fleur, Charlie's love interest in All Dogs Go to Heaven 2\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nRaymond O'Dwyer.

The Irish Terrier is considered one of the oldest terrier breeds. The Dublin dog show in 1873 was the first to provide a separate class for Irish Terriers. By the 1880s, Irish Terriers were the fourth most popular breed in Ireland and Britain.The Irish Terrier is an active and compactly sized dog that is suited for life in both rural and city environments. Its harsh red coat protects it from all kinds of weather.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nBreed standards describe the ideal Irish Terrier as being racy, red and rectangular. Racy: an Irish Terrier should appear powerful without being sturdy or heavy. Rectangular: the outline of the Irish Terrier differs markedly from those of other terriers. The Irish Terrier's body is proportionately longer than that of the Fox Terrier, with a tendency toward racy lines but with no lack of substance. The deep chest is distinctive.\nThe tail is customarily docked soon after birth to approximately two-thirds of the original length. In countries where docking is prohibited, the conformation judges emphasise tail carriage. The tail should start up quite high, but it should not stick straight up or curl over the back or either side of its body. The ears are small and folded forward just above skull level. They are preferably slightly darker than the rest of the coat.\n\n\n==== Coat and color ====\n\nThe Irish Terrier is coloured golden red, red wheaten, or wheaten. Dark red is often mistaken as the only correct colour, possibly because wheaten coats are often of worse quality. As with many other solid-coloured breeds, a small patch of white is allowed on the chest. No white should appear elsewhere. As an Irish Terrier grows older, grey hair may appear here and there.\nThe outer part of the double coat should be straight and wiry in texture, never soft, silky, curly, wavy, or woolly as might be expected in the Kerry Blue Terrier. The coat should lie flat against the skin, and, though having some length, should never be so long as to hide the true shape of the dog. There are longer hairs on the legs, but never so much as a Wire Fox Terrier or Schnauzer. That means you have to have the coat trimmed often which can be expensive.\nThe inner part of the coat, called the under-wool or undercoat, should also be red. The under-wool may be hard for the inexperienced eye to see. Coat should be quite dense and so that \"when parted with the fingers the skin is hardly visible\".A properly trimmed Irish Terrier should have some \"furnishings\" on legs and head. The slightly longer hair on the front legs should form even pillars, while the rear legs should only have some longer hair and not be trimmed too close to the skin. The chin is accentuated with a small beard. The beard should not be as profuse as that of a Schnauzer.\nThe eyes should be dark brown and quite small with a \"fiery\" expression. The eyes are topped with well-groomed eyebrows. The whole head should have good pigmentation.\n\n\n==== Size ====\nMost countries have breed descriptions that say that the Irish Terrier should not be more than 48 cm measured at the withers. However, it is not unusual to see females that are 50 cm tall or dogs that are even 53 cm (20 in). Younger generations are closer to the ideal, but there is a downside to this: when an Irish Terrier is very small and light-boned, it loses the correct racy type.\nVery seldom does one see Irish Terriers that weigh only 11 to 12 kg (25\u201327 lb), as the original Kennel Club breed description states. 13 kg for a female dog and 15 for a male dog are acceptable.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nIrish Terriers are active dogs and need and enjoy consistent mental and physical challenges; well-trained Irish Terriers may do well at a variety of dog sports, such as dog agility.\nThe Irish Terrier is full of life, but not hyperactive; it should be able to relax inside the house and be roused to full activity level quickly.\nIrish Terriers are good with people. They have a highly developed sense of loyalty and it is important that they have a strong responsible leader, for whom they have natural respect. Most Irish Terriers love children and tolerate rough-housing to a certain extent. Irish terriers need exercise; do not get one if you are not prepared to walk it. They enjoy training, new tasks are easily mastered with food and toys working equally well as motivation. Irish terriers have less of an eagerness to please people than some other breeds but have mental ability and enjoy puzzle solving. They respond best to consistent, reward based training from a relaxed, authoritative person. As with all dog breeds, violence should never be used \u2013 instead use distraction and reward the behaviour you want. It is always best to outwit and lure. When seeking a trainer, one should look for a person who has experience with terriers.\nIrish Terriers are often dominant with other dogs. As with any dog, poorly socialised individuals can start fights and early socialisation is a necessity. Most have strong guarding instincts and when these instincts are controlled, make excellent alarming watchdogs.\nThere are more people joining organised dog sports with their terriers. The obedience training required at a certain level in most dog sports is fairly easy, though the precision and long-lasting drive needed in the higher levels may be hard to achieve. Many Irish Terriers excel in dog agility, even though it may be hard to balance the speed, independence and precision needed in the higher levels. To date there is one Agility Champion in the US, and a handful of Finnish and Swedish Irish terriers compete at the most difficult classes.\nIrish Terriers have a good nose and can learn to track either animal or human scent. Many Irish Terriers enjoy Lure Coursing, although they are not eligible for competition like sight hounds are. In Finland one Irish Terrier is a qualified Rescue Dog specialising at Sea Rescue.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe breed's origin is not known.  It is believed to have descended from the black and tan terrier-type dogs of Britain and Ireland, just like the Kerry Blue and Irish Soft-haired Wheaten Terriers in Ireland or the Welsh, Lakeland and Scottish Terriers in Great Britain. There is also conjecture that the breed may share bloodlines with the Irish Wolfhound.F. M. Jowett writes in The Irish Terrier, 'Our Dogs' Publishing Co. Ltd., Manchester, England 1947 \u2013 7th Edition:\nThey are described by an old Irish writer as being the poor man's sentinel, the farmer's friend, and the gentleman's favourite...These dogs were originally bred not so much for their looks as for their working qualities and gameness, the Irish Terrier being by instinct a thorough vermin killer. They were formerly of all types and of all colours \u2013 black-and-tan, grey-and-brindle, wheaten of all shades, and red being the predominant colours. Colour or size evidently did not matter if they were hardy and game.\"\nThe proper selection process of the breed began only in the latter 19th century. They were shown now and then, sometimes in one class, sometimes in separate classes for dogs under and over 9 pounds.\nThe first breed club was set up in Dublin in 1879. Irish Terriers were the first members of the terrier group to be recognised by the English Kennel Club as a native Irish Breed \u2013 this happened just before the end of the 19th century. The first Irish Terriers were taken to the US in the late nineteenth century and quickly became somewhat popular.\nThere used to be big influential kennels in Ireland, the Great Britain and US up to the 1960s. The breed is increasingly \"fashionable\" as a family pet because of its fondness for children. There is ambitious breeding in many continents, including Africa (South Africa), North America, (Northern) Europe and Australia.\n\n\n== Care ==\n\nWhen groomed properly, the Irish Terrier coat will protect the dog from rain and cold. A properly cared-for Irish Terrier does not shed either. The wiry coat is fairly easy to groom, pet dogs (rather than show dogs) needing stripping only once or twice a year.\nThe coat must be stripped by hand or a non-cutting knife to retain its weather-resistant qualities. This does not hurt the dog when done properly. Keeping the skin above the stripped section taut with the other hand helps especially where the skin is looser, i.e. belly and chest. Never cut the coat \u2013 use your fingers or a non-cutting knife. If the coat is clipped, it loses colour and becomes softer, thus losing its weather-resistant characteristics. For the same reason the coat should not be washed too often, as detergents take away the natural skin oils. Most Irish terriers only need washing when dirty.\nWhen stripping, the coat may be \"taken down\" entirely to leave the dog in the undercoat until a new coat grows in. For a pet, this should be done at least twice a year. When a show-quality coat is required, it can be achieved in many ways. One is by \"rolling the coat\", i.e. stripping the dog every X weeks to remove any dead hair. Before a show an expert trimmer is needed to mould especially the head and legs.\nMost Irish Terriers need to have their ears trained during adolescence. Otherwise the ears may stick up, roll back or hang down unaesthetically.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nIrish Terrier is a generally healthy breed. The life expectancy is around 13 \u2013 14 years.\nThe proportions are not exaggerated in any way and thus eye or breathing problems are rare. Most Irish Terriers do not show signs of allergies towards foods. As they are small dogs, the breed has a very low incidence of hip dysplasia.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s there were problems with hyperkeratosis, a disease causing corny pads and severe pain. Today it is widely known which dogs carried the disease and respectable breeders do not use those bloodlines any more. A health study conducted by the Irish Terrier Club of America showed a greater-than-expected incidence of hypothyroidism and cataracts. There are not enough eye-checked individuals to draw any conclusions.\n\n\n== Appearances in arts and culture ==\nJack London's books Jerry of the Islands and Michael, Brother of Jerry were about Irish Terriers that, according to the bloodlines recorded in the beginning of the book, may actually have lived.\nThe 2007 film Firehouse Dog features an Irish Terrier as the title character.\nFormer Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King owned several Irish Terriers (all named Pat), and had s\u00e9ances to \"communicate\" with the first Pat after the dog's death.\nWilliam Wordsworth's poem \"Fidelity\" was written after the death of Charles Gough, who fell from Striding Edge, Helvellyn in 1805. His body found below Red Tarn some months later by a shepherd, his body still being guarded by his Irish Terrier, Foxey. Nearby were discovered the bones of her dead puppies.\nThe University of Notre Dame used an Irish Terrier as its mascot until the 1960s when it was replaced by the Notre Dame Leprechaun.  The dogs had various names, the latest of which was Clashmore Mike.  Two Irish Terriers are depicted in limestone on the east elevation of Alumni Hall.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIrish Terrier at Curlie"}, {"id": 258, "name": "Irish Water Spaniel", "country": "Ireland", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog258", "description": "The Irish Water Spaniel (Irish: An Sp\u00e1inn\u00e9ar Uisce) is a breed of dog that is the largest and one of the oldest of spaniels.\nIt is one of the rarer breeds with the American Kennel Club in terms of registrations.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Irish Water Spaniel is a sturdy, cobby dog native to Ireland. The coat, consisting of dense curls, sheds very little. (see Moult) The colour is liver/puce and has a very definite purple hue unlike the colour of any other known breed. The non-shedding characteristic of the coat means that people usually allergic to dogs might have less of an allergic reaction to Irish Water Spaniels (see hypoallergenic).\nIWS have several distinguishing characteristics which place them among the more recognizable of all breeds:  The topknot of long, loose curls growing down from the head which often covers the eyes; a \"beard\" growing at the back of the throat often accompanied by \"sideburns\"; and a curled, liver (\"puce\")-coloured coat. The most distinguishing characteristic of these dogs is the smooth \"rat tail\", completely free of long coat except at the base where it is covered for 2\u20133 inches with curls. The face is entirely smooth-coated and, unlike the poodle, should require little or no trimming to stay that way. An IWS is ruggedly built with webbed feet to aid in its powerful swimming. Altogether, the IWS presents a picture of a smart, upstanding, strongly built but not leggy dog, combining great intelligence and rugged endurance with a bold, dashing eagerness of temperament.  \nThey are the largest of the Spaniel group.  Dogs range in height from 22 to 24 inches (56\u201361 cm), and weigh 55 to 65 pounds (25\u201330 kg). As their name would imply these dogs love water.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nLike most dogs of the American Kennel Club Sporting group, the Irish Water Spaniel is essentially an active, willing and energetic companion.  Because it has been bred from stock used to fetch game and return it to hand without a fuss, it has the natural instinct of wanting to please.  Its keen sense of working as a team makes it a relatively easy dog to train and discipline.  Because of its great intelligence and quizzical nature, it has the reputation of being the clown of the spaniel family and will do ordinary things in extraordinary ways to achieve that which is asked of it.  Some individual dogs can be very wary of strangers and not every IWS can be trusted to get along with other pets. Early socialisation and training is a must.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Irish Water Spaniel is a native Irish breed dating back at least 1000 years. It is believed in Irish folklore to be the descendant of the Dobhar-ch\u00fa. It is probable that more than one ancient breed of spaniel has gone into its makeup. It is not known from which other breeds Irish Water Spaniels were developed. The acknowledged father of the breed, Justin McCarthy from Dublin, left no breeding records. All manner of dogs have been suggested including: the Poodle, Portuguese Water Dog, Barbet, generic old water dog, the now-extinct English Water Spaniel as well as the Northern and Southern Water Spaniels, but whether Irish Water Spaniels are antecedents, descendants, or mixtures of these other breeds is a matter of some speculation. What is clear is that the breed has ancient roots. The modern breed as we know it was developed in Ireland in the 1830s.\n\n\n== Suitability as a pet ==\nIrish Water Spaniels may make good family dogs, as they are usually excellent with respectful children and with other pets. They can make good guard dogs if they have been trained to do so, and will protect their human families. Not usually an aggressive dog, yet the IWS may have a deep, fierce-sounding bark.\nAll Irish Water Spaniels require a grooming regimen that includes maintaining healthy ears, teeth and nails. The tight double coat of the IWS sheds slightly, however many allergy sufferers have found them to be a comfortable pet with which to live.  The texture of the hair prevents the coat from becoming tightly woven into fabric and upholstery and any stray hairs are easily removed as they will gather together to form \"dust bunnies\".  The coat can be maintained by even the novice owner if a regular effort is maintained to keep it clean and free of mats.  A thorough combing to the skin should take place every 1\u20132 weeks to promote healthy skin and to remove any objects from the coat. Scissoring will be required every 6\u20138 weeks to neaten and shape the coat while regular exposure to water will promote the correct \"ringlets\" over the body coat.\nAlthough happy to curl up and sleep at home, regular walks and exercise are essential for a healthy, contented water spaniel. An unexercised IWS may mean a naughty, mischievous IWS.  An ideal home though would be a working environment, where the dogs' minds as well as bodies are exercised.  Many IWS owners work their dogs in the shooting field, in obedience tests, in agility competitions, or in the conformation show ring.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe IWS is a versatile breed and is found in all types of canine events including:\n\nChampionship\nJunior Showmanship\nCompanion events\nObedience trial\nRally obedience\nDog agility\nTracking trial\nFly ball\nPerformance and other dog sports\nHunt tests\nField trial\nUpland hunting\nDock jumping\n\n\n== Irish Water Spaniel Club of Ireland ==\nThe Irish Water Spaniel Club of Ireland  is one of the oldest dog clubs in the world, supporting and promoting one of the most distinguished and oldest breed of dog in the world. The club is registered with the Irish Kennel Club.\n\n\n== Irish Water Spaniel Club of America ==\nThe IWSCA is the AKC parent club for the IWS. The club exists to preserve and protect this rare breed.  The Club helps educate owners and breeders and welcomes all members who share our love of this extraordinary, versatile dog.  The IWSCA's commitment to the health of the Irish Water Spaniel is reflected in its endorsement of transparency in health findings in accordance with organisations such as Orthopedic Foundation of America (OFA), Canine Health Information Center (CHIC), Canine Eye Registration Foundation (CERF) and Canine Health Foundation.\n\n\n=== IWSCA breeders ===\nMost of the breeders in the IWSCA belong to the Breeders Education Committee (BEC) The BEC exists to inform and educate IWSCA breeders on issues of health, genetics and breeding practices designed to promote the ongoing health and welfare of the Irish Water Spaniel. To this end the BEC breeders have agreed to a rigorous set of recommended breeding practices such as: open information exchange, health testing in accordance with the Irish Water Spaniel CHIC protocol, collaboration with the IWSCA Health and Genetics Committee, participation in breed-specific health studies, promotion of responsible pet ownership, and responsibility for any puppy they have bred \u2013 for the life of that dog. Individual B.E.C. breeders can be found on the IWSCA website.\n\n\n== IWS Health Foundation ==\nThe IWS Health Foundation's aim is to serve the worldwide Irish Water Spaniel community by providing a forum for internet-based collection and circulation of information, research and educational materials relating to the health and life expectancy of the breed, and for anyone with an interest to promote research for the long-term benefit of the breed.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIrish Water Spaniel at Curlie"}, {"id": 259, "name": "Irish Wolfhound", "country": "Ireland", "type": "Sighthound and Pariah", "picture": "dog259", "description": "The Irish Wolfhound (Irish: C\u00fa Faoil, Irish pronunciation: [\u02c8ku\u02d0 \u02c8f\u02e0i\u02d0l\u02b2]) is a breed of domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), specifically a very large sighthound from Ireland. The name originates from its purpose\u2014wolf hunting with dogs\u2014rather than from its appearance. Originally developed from war hounds with the purpose of being a hunting or guard dog. The Irish Wolfhound can be an imposing sight due to their formidable size.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe breed is very old; there are suggestions it may have been brought to Ireland as early as 7000 BC.  These dogs are mentioned, as c\u00fa (variously translated as hound, Irish hound, war dog, wolf dog, etc.) in Irish laws and in Irish literature which dates from the 5th century or, in the case of the Sagas, from the old Irish period - AD 600-900. The word \"C\u00fa\" often became an added prefix of respect on the names of warriors as well as kings denoting that they were worthy of the respect and loyalty of a C\u00fa.\n\n\n=== Pre-19th century ===\n\nAncient artworks and writings have encouraged modern authors to imagine their existence as a breed by 273 BC. However, there is indication that large dogs may have existed even as early as 279 BC when the Tectosages and Tolistobogii Celts sacked Delphi. Survivors left accounts of the fierce Celts and the huge dogs who fought with them and at their side. They were mentioned by Julius Caesar in his treatise, The Gallic Wars, and by 391 AD, they were written about by Roman Consul, Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, who received seven of them, \"canes Scotici\", as a gift to be used for fighting lions and bears, in his words, \"all Rome viewed (them) with wonder\".Wolfhounds were bred as hunting dogs by the ancients, who called them C\u00fa Faoil. The Irish continued to breed them for this purpose, as well as to guard their homes and protect their stock. C\u00fachulain, a name which translates literally as \"hound of Culain\", gained his name when as a child, known then as S\u00e9tanta, when he slew the ferocious guard dog of Culain, forcing him to offer himself as a replacement.\n\nDuring the English Conquest of Ireland, only the nobility were allowed to own Irish Wolfhounds, the numbers permitted depending on position. They were much coveted and were frequently given as gifts to important personages and foreign nobles. Wolfhounds were the companions of the regal, and were housed themselves alongside them. King John of England, in about 1210 presented an Irish hound, Gelert, to Llewellyn, a prince of Wales. The poet The Hon William Robert Spencer Immortalized this hound in a poem.In his History of Ireland completed 1571, Edmund Champion gives a description of the hounds used for hunting the wolves on the Dublin and Wicklow mountains. He says: They (the Irish) are not without wolves and greyhounds to hunt them, bigger of bone and limb than a colt. Due to their popularity overseas many were exported to European royal houses leaving numbers in Ireland depleted. This led to a declaration by Oliver Cromwell himself being published in Kilkenny on 27 April 1652 to ensure that sufficient numbers remained to control the wolf population.References to the Irish Wolfhound in the 18th century tell of its great size, strength and greyhound shape as well as its scarcity. Writing in 1790, Bewick described it as the largest and most beautiful of the dog kind; about 36 inches high, generally of a white or cinnamon colour, somewhat like the Greyhound but more robust. He said that their aspect was mild, disposition peaceful, and strength so great that in combat the Mastiff or Bulldog was far from being an equal to them. The last wolf in Ireland is thought to have been killed at Myshall, on the slopes of Mount Leinster in Co. Carlow in 1786 by a pack of wolfdogs kept by a Mr Watson of Ballydarton. The remaining hounds in the hands of a few families who were mainly descendants of the old Irish chieftains, were now symbols of status rather than hunters, they were said to be the last of their race.\n\n\n=== Modern wolfhound ===\n\nScotsman Captain George Augustus Graham is responsible with a few other breeders for attempting to reaffirm the breed's existence. In 1879 he wrote: \"It has been ascertained beyond all question that there are few specimens of the breed still left in Ireland and England to be considered Irish Wolfhounds, though falling short of the requisite dimensions. This blood is now in my possession.\" Captain Graham devoted his life to ensuring the survival of the Irish Wolfhound. Owing to the small numbers of surviving specimens outcrossing was used in the breeding programme. It is believed that\nBorzoi, Great Dane, Scottish Deerhound and English Mastiff dogs all played their part in Graham's creation of the dog we currently know.  The famous English Mastiff Garnier's Lion was bred to the Deerhound Lufra, and their offspring Marquis enters Wolfhound pedigrees through his granddaughter Young Donagh. Graham included \"a single outcross of Tibetan Wolf Dog\".   This was long assumed to have been a Tibetan Mastiff.  However, a photograph of \"Wolf\" shows a bearded, long-coated dog\u2014what would now be called a \"Tibetan Kyi Apso\" or \"dokhyi apso\". In 1885 Captain Graham with other breeders founded the Irish Wolfhound Club, and the Breed Standard of Points to establish and agree the ideal to which breeders should aspire.The Wolfhound was historically a dog that only nobles could own and was taken up by the British during their rule in Ireland. This made it unpopular as a national symbol and the Kerry Blue Terrier was adopted by Republicans such as Michael Collins.The Wolfhound has been adopted as a symbol by both rugby codes. The national rugby league team is nicknamed the Wolfhounds, and the Irish Rugby Football Union, which governs rugby union, changed the name of the country's A (second-level) national team in that code to the Ireland Wolfhounds in 2010.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nConsidered by the American Kennel Club to be the tallest of all dog breeds, describing the breed as, \"Of great size and commanding appearance, the Irish Wolfhound is remarkable in combining power and swiftness with keen sight. The largest and tallest of the galloping hounds, in general type he is a rough-coated, Greyhound-like breed; very muscular, strong though gracefully built; movements easy and active; head and neck carried high, the tail carried with an upward sweep with a slight curve towards the extremity\". The average height of an Irish Wolfhound should be taller than that of a Great Dane. However, the wolfhound is not to be confused with being the heaviest, as its structure should be similar to that of a Greyhound, with a very broad and deep chest that tucks up.\nIts colour may be grey, brindle, red, black, white, fawn, and wheaten.The Irish Wolfhound was bred for long solitary hunts based solely on the dog's ability to visualize its landscape and perceive, unlike scent hounds (such as Bloodhounds and Beagles) who rely on scent rather than sight. For this reason, the neck of an Irish Wolfhound should be long with the head held high the majority of the time. The Irish Wolfhound should also appear to be longer than it is tall.\nOnce used to hunt wolves, an Irish Wolfhound\u2019s structure should appear as if it is \u201cfast enough to catch a wolf, and strong enough to kill it\u201d.The AKC specifies the minimum height as 32 inches (81 cm) for mature males, 30 inches (76 cm) for females; the minimum weight: 120 pounds (54 kg) for males, 105 pounds (48 kg) for females. It is not rare to see modern day female hounds reaching the minimal height requirements of those of male hounds; most females are well over 30 inches (76 cm) and in most AKC conformation shows a wolfhound\u2019s height is looked at with as much importance as the hound\u2019s head and face structure. Per the AKC, great size, including height of shoulder and proportionate length of body is to be aimed at, to firmly establish a breed averaging 32\u201334 inches (81\u201386 cm) in males. The height/weight standards in Ireland and England are slightly different: males 79 centimetres (31 in)/54.5 kilograms (120 lb), females 71 centimetres (28 in)/40.9 kilograms (90 lb).\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nIrish Wolfhounds have a varied range of personalities and are most often noted for their personal quirks and individualism. An Irish Wolfhound, however, is rarely mindless, and despite its large size is rarely found to be destructive in the house or boisterous. This is because the breed is generally introverted, intelligent, and reserved in character. An easygoing animal, the Irish Wolfhound is quiet by nature. Wolfhounds often create a strong bond with their family and can become quite destructive or morose if left alone for long periods of time. An Irish Wolfhound is not a guard dog and will protect individuals rather than the house or the owner\u2019s possessions. However independent the wolfhound is, the breed becomes attached to both owners and other dogs they are raised with and is therefore not the most adaptable of breeds. Bred for independence, an Irish Wolfhound is not necessarily keen on defending spaces. A wolfhound is most easily described by its historical motto, \u201cgentle when stroked, fierce when provoked\u201d.   They should not be territorially aggressive to other domestic dogs but are born with specialized skills and it is common for hounds at play to course another dog. This is a specific hunting behavior, not a fighting or territorial domination behavior. Most Wolfhounds are very gentle with children. The Irish Wolfhound is relatively easy to train. They respond well to firm, but gentle, consistent leadership. However, historically these dogs were required to work at great distances from their masters and think independently when hunting rather than waiting for detailed commands and this can still be seen in the breed.The Wolfhound of today is far from the one that struck fear into the hearts of the Ancient Romans. Irish Wolfhounds are often favored for their loyalty, affection, patience and devotion. Although at some points in history they have been used as watchdogs, unlike some breeds, the Irish Wolfhound is usually unreliable in this role as they are often friendly toward strangers, although their size can be a natural deterrent. However, when protection is required this dog is never found wanting. When they or their family are in any perceived danger they display a fearless nature. Author and Irish Wolfhound breeder Linda Glover believes the dogs' close affinity with humans makes them acutely aware and sensitive to ill will or malicious intentions leading to their excelling as a guardian rather than guard dog.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nLike many large dog breeds, Irish Wolfhounds have a relatively short lifespan. Published lifespan estimations vary between 6 and 10 years with 7 years being the average. Dilated cardiomyopathy and bone cancer are the leading cause of death and like all deep-chested dogs, gastric torsion (bloat) is common; the breed is affected by hereditary intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.In a privately funded study conducted under the auspices of the Irish Wolfhound Club of America and based on an owner survey, Irish Wolfhounds in the United States from 1966 to 1986 lived to a mean age of 6.47 and died most frequently of bone cancer.  A more recent study by the UK Kennel Club puts the average age of death at 7 years.Studies have shown that neutering is associated with a higher risk of bone cancer in various breeds, with one study suggesting that castration of male Irish Wolfhounds should be avoided at least until the dog is fully grown.Irish Wolfhounds should not receive additional supplements when a good dog food is used. It is generally accepted that they should be fed a low protein adult dog food (19 to 21% protein) from puppyhood onward. Most breeders today recommend that they not be supplemented to slow their rapid growth.\nIrish Wolfhounds are the tallest of all dog breeds, sometimes reaching 7 feet tall on their hind legs. They are well suited to rural life, but their medium energy profile allows them to adjust fairly well to suburban and urban life as well, provided they receive appropriate exercise.\nGenetically, the Irish Wolfhound as a breed is threatened by a bottleneck related to the over-use of a popular sire.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nWolfie, a stray Irish Wolfhound and friend of Paddington Bear in the 2017 film Paddington 2\nWillow the Irish Wolfhound, star of 2005 documentary film Madman Muntz: American Maverick\nSparky from Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure\nAll of the dogs in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim are based on the Irish Wolfhound\nIn the Book Series The Iron Druid Chronicles, the main character, Atticus O'Sullivan, and his apprentice, Granuaile MacTeirnan, adopt wolfhounds named Oberon and Orlaith, respectively.\nIn the Book Series The Chronicles of Amber by Roger Zelazny, Fiona (sister to the protagonist Corwin) mentions that the Irish Wolfhound is the reason there are no more wolves in Ireland, and Florimel (another of Corwin's sisters) owned several Wolfhounds.\nMost of the dogs in Bloodborne (video game) are based on the irish wolfhound.\nFrom the book \u201cThe Well of Ascension\u201d part 2 of The Mistborn trilogy by Brandon Sanderson, protagonist Vin has a Kandra (shape shifting) companion that takes the shape of a wolfhound.\nIn the movie \u201cThe 13th Warrior\u201d, Rekkae, the dog of the viking leader Buliwyf, is an Irish Wolfhound.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWolves in Ireland\nLurcher (cross between a sighthound such as the Irish Wolfhound and a working breed)\nLongdog (cross between two sighthounds)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMcBryde, Mary (1998).

This hound is the slightly smaller counterpart to the longer-coated Istrian Coarse-haired Hound from the same region.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Istrian Short-haired Hound has a short, smooth, glossy, hard coat, primarily white with sparse patches of orange. The breed has a typical well-muscled hound body, with long legs and a long tail. The head is fairly broad and flat (not domed on top) with short (for a hound) triangular drop ears that hang close to the head, a type typically called East European.The ideal height for an adult dog is 50 cm (19.5 in) at the withers and weight is about 18 kg (40 lb); females are slightly smaller.The cry or baying while hunting (important for a scenthound) is described as persistent and sharp.\n\n\n== History ==\nNo actual proof of great antiquity is known for today's breed (such as written lineages going back to antiquity), although much fanciful conjecture exists. The type is very old, and the modern breed resembles images seen in frescoes as early as 1497. Writers cited as having mentioned the type include Bishop of \u0110akovo Petar Baki\u0107 in 1719 and the veterinarian Franjo Berti\u0107, also of \u0110akovo, in 1859. The old type is seen in the Posavaz Hound and the Istrian Coarse-haired Hound, as well. The smooth- and coarse-haired hounds were used for hunting in Istria (see the article on Motovun for photographs of the sort of mountainous terrain they were bred to hunt) while the Posavaz Hound is from the Sava Valley. The Istrian hounds are thought to be the oldest of the hound breeds in the Balkan region.A stud book was established in 1924 to document which hounds were considered of this breed. The FCI accepted the breed in 1949, but  the first breed standard was not published until 1973 (the FCI does not write the breed standard, it is written in the breed's country of origin and published by the FCI to be used internationally, so that other countries will also describe the breed in the same manner as the breed's home country, and not change it to suit themselves.) It is recognised in the scenthound group 6. It is also recognised in the scenthound group in North America by the United Kennel Club. It also is recognised under its original name, the standard English translations, other translations or combinations of the translation and Croatian name by minor kennel clubs and other organisations. It also may be promoted as a rare breed for those seeking an unusual pet.\nThe Istrian Short-haired Hound is still kept in its homeland and in nearby areas for hunting, not as a pet, and is especially valued for hunting fox and rabbit.\n\n\n== Health and temperament ==\nNo specific health problems or claims of extraordinary health have been documented for this breed. The ideal temperament according to the standard is docile and calm, and lively and enthusiastic when hunting.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 262, "name": "Italian Greyhound", "country": "Italy", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog262", "description": "The Italian Greyhound (in Italian: piccolo levriero italiano) is a small breed of dog; of the sighthound type, sometimes called the Italian for short, and nicknamed the \"IG\" or \"Iggy\".\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Italian Greyhound is the smallest of the sighthounds, typically weighing about 8 to 15 lb (3.6 to 6.8 kg) and standing about 13 to 15 inches (33 to 38 cm) tall at the shoulder. They are in the toy group in the UK and US but in the sighthound group in the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI).\nThe Italian Greyhound's chest is deep, with a tucked up abdomen, long slender legs and a long neck that tapers down to a small head. The head is long and pointed, like a full sized Greyhound. Overall, they look like \"miniature\" Greyhounds. Though many Italian Greyhound owners dispute the use of the term \"miniature greyhound\" in reference to the breed itself, by definition of the American Kennel Club they are true genetic Greyhounds, with a bloodline extending back over 2,000 years. Their current small stature is a function of selective breeding. Their gait is distinctive and should be high stepping and free, rather like that of a horse.   They are able to run at top speed with a double suspension gallop, and can achieve a top speed of up to 25 miles per hour (40 km/h).\nRecognised coat colours in the UK are Black, Blue (grey), Red and Fawn. For The Kennel Club (UK), all colours except brindle are accepted. For the American Kennel Club, and the Australian National Kennel Council, parti colored Italian Greyhounds are accepted, while the FCI standard for international shows allows white only on the chest and feet. Coat colours of Black, Blue and Isabelle (Fawn) exist in all nuances.The modern Italian Greyhound's appearance is a result of breeders throughout Europe, particularly Austrian, German, Italian, French and British, making great contributions to the forming of this breed. The Italian Greyhound should resemble a small Greyhound, or rather a Sloughi.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe Italian Greyhound makes a good companion dog and enjoys the company of people. However, the breed's slim build and short coat make them somewhat fragile, and injury can result from rough or careless play with children. They are fast, agile and athletic, and love to run. Due to their size, and in some lineages poor bone density, they are prone to broken legs. Italian Greyhounds make reasonably good watchdogs, as they bark at unfamiliar sounds. They may also bark at passers-by and other animals. However, they should not be considered \"true\" guard dogs as they are often aloof with strangers and easily spooked to run.\nAs sighthounds, Italian Greyhounds instinctively hunt by sight and have an extremely high predator drive. As with most sighthounds, martingale collars are often used with Italian greyhounds since their necks are nearly the same width as their skulls. Some Italian Greyhounds take part in dog agility. The breed's lithe body and its love of action provide potential to do well at this sport, although their natural inclination is for straight-out racing rather than for working tightly as a team with a handler on a technical course. Lure coursing is well-suited to the Italian Greyhound. They are fast dogs, and while they are not as well suited to racing as their larger cousins, many Italian Greyhounds participate in amateur straight-track and oval-track racing.\n\n\n== Grooming ==\n\nDogs of this breed have an extremely short and almost odorless coat that requires little more than an occasional bath about once a month (though many veterinarians suggest that even bathing once per month is too frequent for this breed), but a wipe-down with a damp cloth is recommended after walks as seeds, burrs and floating dust in the air can get into the coat and irritate the skin. This breed sheds medium to little hair.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Italian Greyhound has a median lifespan of 13.5 in a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey. A 1993 US breed club survey gives an average lifespan of 9 years but more than a quarter of the dogs had \"accidents\" recorded as cause of death. \nHealth problems that can be found in the breed:\nEpilepsy\nLegg-Perthes disease (degeneration of the hip)\nPatellar Luxation (slipped stifles)\nvon Willebrand disease (vWD) (Bleeding disorder)\nProgressive retinal atrophy (PRA)\nColor dilution alopecia (hair loss in dilute pigmented dogs, i.e.: blues, blue fawns, etc.)\nLeg Breaks (most common under the age of 2)\nCataracts\nVitreous degeneration\nLiver shunts\nAutoimmune hemolytic anemia\nPeriodontal disease, gum recession, early tooth loss, bad tooth enamel\nHypothyroidism, Autoimmune Thyroid Disease (Hashimoto's disease)Their scissor-bite and thin jaw bones make them susceptible to periodontal disease, which can be avoided with good dental care. Daily brushing has been shown to be very beneficial as well as regular dental cleanings from the vet.\nResponsible breeders will routinely check their dogs for the onset of various inherited disorders, these commonly include (but are not limited to): CERF examinations on eyes, OFA patellar examinations, OFA thyroid function panels, von Willebrand's factor, OFA hip and Legg-Perthes disease x-rays, and others. In research by the Ortheopedic Foundation for Animals, the Italian Greyhound was found to be the least affected by hip dysplasia out of 157 breeds. Tests were conducted on 169 individual Italian Greyhounds, of which none were found to have hip dysplasia and 59.2% scored excellent on their hip evaluations.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe name of the breed is a reference to the breed's popularity in Renaissance Italy. Mummified dogs very similar to the Italian Greyhound (or small Greyhounds) have been found in Egypt, and pictorials of small Greyhounds have been found in Pompeii, and they were probably the only accepted companion-dog there. Dogs similar to Italian Greyhounds are recorded as having been seen around Emperor Nero's court in Rome in the first century AD.The breed is believed to have originated more than 2,000 years ago in the countries now known as Greece and Turkey. This belief is based on the depiction of miniature greyhounds in the early decorative arts of these countries and on the archaeological discovery of small greyhound skeletons. By the Middle Ages, the breed had become distributed throughout Southern Europe and was later a favorite of the Italians of the sixteenth century, among whom miniature dogs were in great demand. Sadly, though, 'designer' breeders tried, and failed, to make the breed even smaller by crossbreeding it with other breeds of dogs. This only led to mutations with deformed skulls, bulging eyes and dental problems. The original Italian Greyhound had almost disappeared when groups of breeders got together and managed to return the breed to normal. From this period onward the history of the breed can be fairly well traced as it spread through Europe, arriving in England in the seventeenth century.The grace of the breed has prompted several artists to include the dogs in paintings, among others Vel\u00e1zquez, Pisanello, and Giotto.The breed has been popular with royalty. Among the royal aficionados are Mary, Queen of Scots, Queen Anne, Queen Victoria, Catherine the Great, Frederick the Great and Maud, Queen of Norway.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCompanion group\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nItalian Greyhound at Curlie"}, {"id": 263, "name": "Jack Russell Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog263", "description": "The Jack Russell Terrier is a small terrier that has its origins in fox hunting. It is principally white-bodied and smooth, rough or broken-coated but can be any colour.\nThe Jack Russell is frequently confused with the Parson Russell terrier (see the American Kennel Club) and the Russell terrier, which is a shorter-legged, stockier variety. (Within the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, the \"Russell terrier\" is also known as \"Jack Russell terrier\".) The term \"Jack Russell\" is also commonly misapplied to other small white terriers. The Jack Russell is a broad type, with a size range of 10\u201315 inches (25\u201338 cm). The Parson Russell is limited only to a middle range with a standard size of 12\u201314 inches (30\u201336 cm), while the Russell terrier is smaller at 8\u201312 inches (20\u201330 cm). Each breed has different physical proportions according to the standards of their breed clubs.\nJack Russells are an energetic breed that rely on a high level of exercise and stimulation and are relatively free from serious health complaints. Originating from dogs bred and used by Reverend John Russell in the early 19th century, from whom the breed takes its name, the Jack Russell has similar origins to the modern Fox terrier. It has gone through several changes over the years, corresponding to different use and breed standards set by kennel clubs. Recognition by kennel clubs for the Jack Russell breed has been opposed by the breed's parent societies \u2013 which resulted in the breeding and recognition of the Parson Russell terrier. Jack Russells have appeared many times in film, television, and print \u2013 with several historical dogs of note.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Sporting parson ===\n\nThe small white fox-working terriers we know today were first bred by the Reverend John Russell, a parson and hunting enthusiast born in 1795, and they can trace their origin to the now extinct English white terrier. Difficulty in differentiating the dog from the creature it was pursuing brought about the need for a mostly white dog, and so in 1819 during his last year of university at Exeter College, Oxford, he purchased a small white and tan terrier female named Trump from a local milkman in the nearby small hamlet of Elsfield or Marston). Trump epitomised his ideal Fox terrier, which, at the time, was a term used for any terrier which was used to bolt foxes out of their burrows. Her colouring was described as \"...white, with just a patch of dark tan over each eye and ear; whilst a similar dot, not larger than a penny piece, marks the root of the tail.\" Davies, a friend of Russell's, wrote: \"Trump was such an animal as Russell had only seen in his dreams\". She was the basis for a breeding program to develop a terrier with high stamina for the hunt as well as the courage and formation to chase out foxes that had gone to ground. By the 1850s, these dogs were recognised as a distinct breed.An important attribute in this dog was a tempered aggressiveness that would provide the necessary drive to pursue and bolt the fox, without resulting in physical harm to the quarry and effectively ending the chase, which was considered unsporting. Russell was said to have prided himself that his terriers never tasted blood. This line of terriers developed by John Russell was well respected for those qualities, and his dogs were often taken on by hunt enthusiasts. It is unlikely, however, that any dogs alive today can be proved to be descendants from Trump, as Russell was forced to sell all his dogs on more than one occasion because of financial difficulty, and had only four aged (and non-breeding) terriers left when he died in 1883.The Fox terrier and Jack Russell terrier type dogs of today are all descended from dogs of that period, although documented pedigrees earlier than 1862 have not been found, although several records remain of documented breeding by John Russell between the 1860s and 1880s. The Fox Terrier Club was formed in 1875 with Russell as one of the founder members; its breed standard was aspiration, and not a description of how the breed appeared then. By the start of the 20th century, the Fox terrier had altered more towards the modern breed, but in some parts of the country the old style of John Russell's terriers remained, and it is from those dogs that the modern Jack Russell type has descended.Many breeds can claim heritage to the early Fox terrier of this period, including the Brazilian terrier, Japanese terrier, Miniature Fox terrier, Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz, Rat terrier, and Tenterfield terrier.\n\n\n=== After John Russell ===\n\nFollowing Russell's death, the only people who made serious efforts to continue those strains were two men, one in Chislehurst with the surname of East, and another in Cornwall named Archer. East, at one point, had several couples, all of which were descended from one of Russell's dogs. The type aimed for were not as big as the show Fox terrier and were usually less than 15 pounds (6.8 kg).Arthur Blake Heinemann created the first breed standard and, in 1894, he founded the Devon and Somerset Badger Club, the aims of which were to promote badger digging rather than fox hunting, and the breeding of terriers suitable for this purpose. Terriers were acquired from Nicholas Snow of Oare, and they were likely descended from Russell's original dogs, as Russell would probably have hunted at some point with Snow's hunting club and is likely to have provided at least some of their original terriers. By the turn of the 20th century, Russell's name had become associated with this breed of dog.The club was later renamed the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club. Badger digging required a different type of dog than fox hunting, and it is likely that Bull terrier stock was introduced to strengthen the breed, which may have caused the creation of a shorter legged variety of Jack Russell terrier that started to appear around this period. At the same time that a split was appearing between show and working Fox terriers, a further split was occurring between two different types of white terrier, both carrying Jack Russell's name. Heinemann was invited to judge classes for working terriers at Crufts with an aim to bring working terriers back into the show ring and influence those that disregard working qualities in dogs. These classes were continued for several years by various judges, but Charles Cruft dropped the attempt as the classes were never heavily competed. Following Heinemann's death in 1930, the kennel and leadership of the club passed to Annie Harris, but the club itself folded shortly before World War II.\n\n\n=== Post World War II ===\n\nFollowing World War II, the requirement for hunting dogs drastically declined, and with it the numbers of Jack Russell terriers. The dogs were increasingly used as family and companion dogs. Further crossbreeding occurred, with Welsh corgis, Chihuahuas, and other smaller breeds of terrier. The offspring of these crosses became known as \"Puddin' Dogs\", \"Shortie Jacks\", or \"Russell Terriers\".The Jack Russell Terrier Club of America was formed in 1976 by Ailsa Crawford, one of the first Jack Russell terrier breeders in the United States. Size ranges for dogs were kept broad, with the ability of working dogs awarded higher than those in conformation shows. An open registry was maintained, with restricted line breeding. Registration for the club is made at adulthood for Jack Russells, rather than at birth, to ensure the breed's qualities remain, given the open registry.\n\nSeveral breed clubs appeared in the United Kingdom during the 1970s to promote the breed, including the Jack Russell Club of Great Britain (JRTCGB) and the South East Jack Russell Terrier Club (SEJRTC). The JRTCGB promoted the range of sizes that remain in its standards today, whereas the SEJRTC set a minimum height for dogs at 13 inches (33 cm). While the JRTCGB sought to ensure that the breed's working ability remained through non-recognition with other breed registries, the SEJRTC activity sought recognition with the UK Kennel Club. In 1983, the Parson Jack Russell  Club of Great Britain (PJRTCGB) was resurrected to seek Kennel Club recognition for the breed. Although the application was initially rejected, a new standard was created for the PJRTCGB based on the standard of the SEJRTC, and under that standard the breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1990 as the Parson Jack Russell terrier. Jack was dropped from the official name in 1999, and the recognised name of the breed became the Parson Russell terrier.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the American Kennel Club explored the possibility of recognising the Jack Russell terrier. This move was opposed by the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America as they did not want the breed to lose its essential working characteristics. The Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association formed and petitioned the AKC; the breed's admission was granted in 2001. Under the AKC recognised standard, the size of the breed was narrowed from the previous club's standard, and the name of the AKC recognised Jack Russell terrier was changed to Parson Russell terrier, with the Jack Russell Terrier Breeders Association renamed to the Parson Russell Terrier Association of America.The Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) and the New Zealand Kennel Club (NZCK) are some of national kennel associations that register both the Jack Russell terrier and the Parson Russell terrier; however, the size requirements for the Jack Russell terrier under both those standards would classify a dog as a Russell terrier in the United States. In 2009, there were 1073 Jack Russells registered with the ANKC, compared to 18 for the Parson Russell terrier. Other modern breeds are often mistaken for modern Jack Russell terriers, including their cousin the Parson Russell terrier, the Tenterfield terrier, and the Rat Terrier. Several other modern breeds exist that descended from the early Fox Terrier breed, including the Brazilian Terrier, Japanese Terrier, Miniature Fox Terrier, Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz, Rat Terrier, and Tenterfield Terrier.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nDue to their working nature, Jack Russell terriers remain much as they were some 200 years ago. They are sturdy, tough, and tenacious, measuring between 10\u201315 inches (25\u201338 cm) at the withers, and weigh 14\u201318 pounds (6.4\u20138.2 kg). The body length must be in proportion to the height, and the dog should present a compact, balanced image. Predominantly white in coloration (more than 51%) with black and/or brown and/or tan markings, they exhibit either a smooth, rough or a combination of both which is known as a broken coat. A broken-coated dog may have longer hair on the tail or face than that which is seen on a smooth-coated dog. The skin can sometimes show a pattern of small black or brown spots, referred to as \"ticking\" that do not carry through to the outer coat.  All coat types should be dense double coats that are neither silky (in the case of smooth coats) nor woolly (in the case of rough coats).\n\nThe head should be of moderate width at the ears, narrowing to the eyes, and slightly flat between the ears. There should be a defined but not overpronounced stop at the end of the muzzle where it meets the head, and a black nose. The jaw should be powerful and well boned with a scissor bite and straight teeth. The eyes are almond shaped and dark coloured and should be full of life and intelligence. Small V-shaped ears of moderate thickness are carried forward on the head. When the dog is alert, the tip of the V should not extend past the outer corner of the eyes. The tail is set high and in the past was docked to approximately five inches in order to provide a sufficient hand-hold for gripping the terrier.The Jack Russell should always appear balanced and alert.  As it is primarily a working terrier, its most important physical characteristic is its chest size, which must not be so large that it prevents the dog from entering and working in burrows. The red fox is the traditional quarry of the Jack Russell terrier, so the working Jack Russell must be small enough to pursue it. Red foxes vary in size, but across the world, they average from 13\u201317 pounds (5.9\u20137.7 kg) in weight and have an average chest size of 12\u201314 inches (30\u201336 cm) at the widest part.\n\n\n=== Differences with related breeds ===\n\nThe Jack Russell terrier and Parson Russell terrier breeds are similar, sharing a common origin, but have several marked differences \u2014 the most notable being the range of acceptable heights. Other differences in the Parson can include a longer head and larger chest as well as overall a larger body size. The height of a Parson Russell at the withers according to the breed standard is 12\u201314 inches (30\u201336 cm) which places it within the range of the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America's standard size for a Jack Russell of 10\u201315 inches (25\u201338 cm). However, the Parson Russell is a conformation show standard whereas the Jack Russell standard is a more general working standard.The Russell terrier, which is also sometimes called the English Jack Russell terrier or the Short Jack Russell terrier is a generally smaller related breed. Both the breed standards of the American Russell Terrier Club and the English Jack Russell Terrier Club Alliance states that at the withers it should be an ideal height of 8\u201312 inches (20\u201330 cm). Although sometimes called the English or Irish Jack Russell terrier, this is not the recognised height of Jack Russells in the United Kingdom. According to the Jack Russell Club of Great Britain's breed standard, it is the same size as the standard for Jack Russells in the United States, 10\u201315 inches (25\u201338 cm). Compared to the Parson, the Russell terrier should always be longer than tall at the withers, whereas the Parson's points should be of equal distance. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale standard for the Jack Russell terrier has this smaller size listed as a requirement. Terrierman Eddie Chapman, who has hunted in Devon for more than 30 years, the same area that John Russell himself hunted, notes that, \"I can state categorically that if given the choice, ninety-nine percent of hunt terrier men would buy an under 12\" worker, if it was available, over a 14\" one.\"\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nJack Russells are first and foremost a working terrier. Originally bred to bolt foxes from their dens during hunts, they are used on numerous ground-dwelling quarry such as groundhog, badger, and red and grey fox. The working JRT is required to locate quarry in the earth, and then either bolt it or hold it in place until they are dug to. To accomplish this, the dog will not bark but will expect attention to the quarry continuously. Because the preservation of this working ability is of highest importance to most registered JRTCA/JRTCGB breeders, Jack Russells tend to be extremely intelligent, athletic, fearless, and vocal dogs. It is not uncommon for these dogs to become moody or destructive if not properly stimulated and exercised, as they have a tendency to bore easily and will often create their own fun when left alone to entertain themselves.Their high energy and drive make these dogs ideally suited to a number of different dog sports such as flyball or agility. Obedience classes are also recommended to potential owners, as Jack Russells can be stubborn at times and aggressive towards other animals and humans if not properly socialized. Despite their small size, these dogs are not recommended for the condominium or apartment dweller unless the owner is ready to take on the daunting task of providing the dog with the necessary amount of exercise and stimulation. They have a tremendous amount of energy for their size, a fact which can sometimes lead to trouble involving larger animals. They may seem never to tire and will still be energetic after their owner has called it a day. While socialised members of the breed are friendly towards children, they will not tolerate abuse even if it is unintentional.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThe breed has a reputation for being healthy with a long lifespan. Breeders have protected the gene pool, and direct in-line breeding has been prevented. Jack Russells can live from 13 to 16 years given proper care. However, certain lines have been noted for having specific health concerns and, therefore, could occur in any line or generation because of recessive genes. These issues can include hereditary cataracts, ectopia lentis, congenital deafness, patellar luxation, ataxia, myasthenia gravis, Legg\u2013Calv\u00e9\u2013Perthes syndrome, and von Willebrand disease.Being a hunt-driven dog, the Jack Russell will usually pursue most creatures that it encounters. This includes the skunk, and the breed is prone to skunk toxic shock syndrome. The chemical in the skunk spray is absorbed by the dog and causes the red blood cells to undergo haemolysis, which can occasionally lead to fatal anaemia and kidney failure. If sprayed underground, it can also cause chemical burning of the cornea. Treatments are available to flush the toxin out of the dog's system.\n\n\n=== Eye disorders ===\nLens luxation, also known as ectopia lentis is the most common hereditary disorder in Jack Russell terriers. Even so, this condition is not a common occurrence in the breed. Most frequently appearing in dogs between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, it is where the lens in one or both eyes becomes displaced. There are two types, posterior luxation (where the lens slips to the back of the eye) and anterior luxation (where the lens slips forward). Posterior luxation is the less severe of the two types, as the eye can appear normal although the dog's eyesight will be affected. In anterior luxation, the lens can slip forward and rub against the cornea, damaging it. Anterior luxation also has a high probability of causing glaucoma which can lead to partial or complete blindness. Treatment is available and may include both medical and surgical options. Secondary lens luxation is caused by trauma to the eye and is not hereditary. The condition appears in a number of terrier breeds as well as the Border collie, Brittany and Cardigan Welsh corgi.Cataracts can affect any breed of dog and is the same condition as seen in humans. Here the lens of the eye hardens and is characterised by cloudiness in the eye. Cataracts will blur the dog's vision and can lead to permanent blindness if left untreated. While considered mainly a hereditary disease, it can also be caused by diabetes, old age, radiation, eye injury or exposure to high temperatures.\n\n\n=== Musculoskeletal conditions ===\nPatellar luxation, also known as luxating patella, is a hereditary disorder affecting the knees. It is where the kneecap slips off the groove on which it normally sits. The effects can be temporary with the dog running while holding its hind leg in the air before running on it again once the kneecap slipped back into place as if nothing has happened. Dogs can have a problem with both rear knees, and complications can include arthritis or torn knee ligaments. Severe cases can require surgery.\nSome are prone to dislocation of the kneecaps, inherited eye diseases, deafness and Legg Perthes\u2014a disease of the hip joints of small dog breeds. Prone to mast cell tumors.\nLegg\u2013Calv\u00e9\u2013Perthes syndrome, also called Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head, is where the ball section of the femur in the hip joint deteriorates following interruption of the blood flow and is the same condition as in humans. In dogs, this causes lameness of the hind-legs, the thigh muscles to atrophy and pain in the joint. It usually occurs between 6\u201312 months of age and has been documented in a variety of other terrier breeds including the Border terrier, Lakeland terrier, and Wheaten terrier.\n\n\n== Well-known Jack Russell terriers ==\n\nNipper was a dog born in 1884 who was thought to be a dog of the Jack Russell terrier type. He was the inspiration for the painting Dog looking at and listening to a Phonograph, later renamed to His Master's Voice. The painting was used by a variety of music related companies including The Gramophone Company, EMI, the Victor Talking Machine Company, and RCA. Today it remains in use incorporated into the logo for HMV in UK and Europe.A Jack Russell named Bothy made history in 1982 as part of the Transglobe Expedition. Owned by explorers Ranulph and Ginny Fiennes, he became the first dog to travel to both the north and south poles. This feat is unlikely to be repeated, as all dogs have been banned from Antarctica by the Antarctic Treaty nations since 1994, due to fears that they could transmit diseases to the native seal population. Ranulph Fiennes and Charles Burton actually made the trip to the north pole by powered sledges before signalling to the base camp that they had arrived. To celebrate their achievement, a plane was sent out to take the two men champagne, along with Bothy.On 29 April 2007, a Jack Russell named George saved five children at a carnival in New Zealand from an attack by two pit bulls. He was reported to have charged at them and held them at bay long enough for the children to get away. Killed by the pit bulls, he was posthumously awarded the PDSA Gold Medal in 2009, the animal equivalent of the George Cross. A statue has been erected in Manaia, New Zealand, in his memory.  A former US Marine also donated to George's owner a Purple Heart award he had received for service in Vietnam.\n\n\n=== On screen and in literature ===\n\nIn the UK, one of the more recognisable canine stars was restaurateur and chef Rick Stein's irrepressible terrier Chalky, who frequently upstaged his owner on his various cookery series. He was unique in having his own line of merchandise, including plushes, tea towels, art prints, art paw prints and two real ales \u2013 Chalky's Bite and Chalky's Bark, which won gold in the Quality Drink Awards 2009. Chalky was given a BBC obituary when he died in 2007.Father Moose and son Enzo played the role of Eddie on the long-running TV sitcom Frasier. Eddie belonged to lead character Frasier's father Martin Crane, and constantly \"stole the show\" with his deadpan antics, receiving more fan mail than any other Frasier character. Moose and Enzo also starred as Skip in the 2000 film My Dog Skip.\nWishbone, from the television show of the same name which aired from 1995 to 2001 in the United States, was a Jack Russell terrier. Wishbone's real name was Soccer and was chosen from over a hundred other dogs vying for the part.Actor Gene Hackman's pet in the 1995 movie Crimson Tide was a smooth-coated Jack Russell terrier named \"Bear\". Max, a Jack Russell terrier, played the role of Milo who is one of Stanley Ipkiss's only friends in the 1994 U.S film The Mask starring Jim Carrey. Max also played the female dog Audrey in the 2000 film Mr. Accident. In the 2009 movie Hotel for Dogs, Friday, one of the main characters is a Jack Russell, played by the dog actor Cosmo. Cosmo went on to appear in the films Paul Blart: Mall Cop and Beginners.Jack Russell: Dog Detective is a series of children's books by authors Darrell and Sally Odgers, and published by Scholastic. It is about the adventures of a Jack Russell terrier named Jack Russell and his gang of friends including Jill Russell, Lord \"Red\" Setter and Foxie Terrier.Uggie (2002-2015) was an animal actor, appearing in commercials starting in 2005 and most notably cast in Water for Elephants and The Artist, both in 2011. In the same year, based on interest following The Artist, the \"Consider Uggie\" campaign was launched, which attempted to gain the dog a nomination for an Academy Award. In 2012, Uggie was named Nintendo's first-ever spokesdog.Patrick McDonnell's comic strip Mutts features a Jack Russell terrier named Earl who is a main character in the comic strip.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFox hunting\nWorking terriers\n\n\n=== Clubs and associations ===\nJack Russell Terrier Club of America\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJack Russell Terrier at Curlie"}, {"id": 264, "name": "Jagdterrier", "country": "Germany", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog264", "description": "The Jagdterrier ( YAHK-terr-i-\u0259r) (English: Hunting Terrier) is a type of working terrier, originating in Germany, that is used for hunting quarry both above and underground. This breed of terrier is also called the German Hunt Terrier.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nA typical appearance of a Jagdterrier is black and tan, with the tan being more of a rust colour on the muzzle and undercarriage. It can also be chocolate or liver brown with white markings although the white markings and the chocolate colouring should be avoided in breeding programs along with a brown nose. Black and tan/rust markings should be the goal. The breed standard calls for an animal that stands 33 to 40 centimetres (13 to 16 inches) at the shoulders, with females weighing from 7.5 to 8.5 kilograms (17 to 19 pounds), and males weighing from 9 to 10 kilograms (20 to 22 pounds). The coat of a Jagdterrier can be either hairy, smooth or broken. All varieties do shed. The tail is normally (but not always) docked at 2/3 the natural length.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nJagdterriers were developed to be all-round hunting dogs. Though often used for quarry that dens underground, especially badger, fox, and raccoon dog, Jagdterriers are also used to drive wild boar and rabbits out of thickets, and to blood track wounded animals, such as deer. Due to their intelligence and adaptability, Jagdterriers can make good pets, but it should be remembered that they are primarily a hunting dog with a strong prey drive.\n\n\n== History ==\nBetween the two World Wars, game managers in Germany were focused on getting rid of foreign or introduced species, and bringing back now-extinct species that figured prominently in the mythology of the nation.\nOne of the pioneers of this peculiar quest was Lutz Heck, the curator of the Berlin Zoo, who went on to \"back breed\" primitive cattle and horses to \"recreate\" the extinct aurochs (the kind of wild cattle seen in the cave paintings at Lascaux, France) and the tarpan (a kind of primitive forest pony). Heck was also instrumental in the recreation of an extinct species (or subspecies) of zebra called the \"quagga\".Heck's interest in dogs was driven in part by his passion for hunting, and in part by nationalism that was mixed with a desire to see what could be done with selective breeding. A social climber and decided sycophant, Lutz Heck and his brother Heinz Heck were men who courted power and counted among their friends both Adolf Hitler and Hermann G\u00f6ring.\nEven as nationalism and an interest in genetic engineering were rising in Germany, terriers were also rising to the height of fashion in much of Europe and the United States. The Allied Terrier Show was taken over by Charles Crufts in 1886, and was the largest dog show in the world before World War I, while the first breed-specific dog publication anywhere was a magazine devoted to fox terriers. The Westminster Dog Show was begun in 1907, and the first winner was a fox terrier. A fox terrier won again in 1908, 1909, 1910, 1911, 1915, 1916, and 1917.\nA fascination with terriers, fervent nationalism, and a propensity towards genetic engineering were braided together when Lutz Heck presented four black-and-tan Fell terriers\u2014similar to what we now would call a Patterdale Terrier\u2014to Carl Eric Gruenewald and Walter Zangenbert. Gruenewald was a \"cynologist\" (a self-styled dog man with an interest in genetics) and Zangenbert was a dedicated hunter with an interest in fox terriers.\nIt did not take much prodding on Heck's part to convince Gruenewald and Zangenbert that what the world needed was a true German Hunt Terrier to compete with  the British and American fox terriers in the field.\nGruenewald and Zangenbert added to their team Chief Forester R. Fiess and Dr. Herbert Lackner, men with land for a kennel, and the financial means to support it over a decade-long quest.\nAn early problem was that the Black and Tan Terriers selected as the core breeding stock and deemed \"ideal hunters\" based on colour alone were, in fact, not all that great at hunting. As Gruenewald later wrote:\n\n\"We were glad to own fox terriers with the hunting color, and we hoped to use these four puppies successfully in breeding to establish a hunting fox terrier breed (jagdfoxterrier-stamm). From the viewpoint of hunting these four dogs were not bad, although they left much to desire. First we tried inbreeding, pairing brothers with sisters. But the results were not good. No wonder -- after all, the parents weren't real hunting dogs. The picture changed, though, when we bred our four 'originals' with our well-trained old hunting fox terriers. The beautiful dark color continued to be dominate. Dogs with a lot of the white color and spotted dogs were selected and eliminated from further breeding.\"The breeding program for the Jagdterrier was massive in scale and unwavering in its selection criteria. At one point the men had 700 dogs in their kennels, and not a single dog was allowed to be placed outside of the kennel. Dogs that did not look the part, or which were deemed to be not of the quality desired, were culled (standard practice the world over until the 1960s). Early dogs were both smooth and rough coat, but the breeding program moved to get rid of smooth coats, and the coat of the final product can best be described as \"slape coated\"\u2014a short, hard and wiry coat that sheds water and dirt while providing warmth in winter.\nAfter only 10 years time the dogs were breeding more-or-less true, with a Patterdale-like appearance, albeit with more red on the undercarriage.\nThe German Hunting Terrier Club (Deutscher Jagdterrier-Club) was founded in 1926, and the dog was warmly embraced in part because it fit well with the rising nationalistic sentiment within Germany at the time. It did not hurt at all that Lutz Heck was a darling of the Nazi regime and counted Hermann G\u00f6ring among his closest friends.\nIn 1938, a German by the name of Max Thiel, Sr. bought his first Jagdterrier. Thiel hunted with this dog for only a few years before the start of World War II. During the war Thiel lost his dogs, but after the war he settled in Bavaria and purchased two female dogs, Asta and Naja.\nIn 1951 Thiel moved to the US, bringing with him Naja. He soon sent for Asta, who was bred and shipped pregnant. In 1954, Armin Schwarz Sr., imported a \"champion\" sire named Axel, and a few more litters were promulgated. In March 1956, nine Jadgterrier owners met in St. Louis, Missouri, and formed the Jagdterrier Club of America, with the expressed goal of getting the dog recognized by the American Kennel Club. In fact, the club did not prosper and eventually died out.\nThe Jadgterrier did not become popular in the US for several reasons, not the least of which was that in the US very few people hunt fox to ground. In recent years, with the rise of interest in terrier work in the US, new lines of Jagdterriers have been imported to the US, but most are used for above-ground or barn work due to their size. For a Jadgterrier to do well working underground in the US, it has to be at the absolutely smallest end of the breed standard or even undersized.\nMany of the newer/later imports to the US are within the true FCI breed standard (correct size) and are being used successfully both above and below ground, with many reports of their offspring making exceptional hunting, flush and retrieval dogs both on land and in water. Today there are many hunters across the US adopting this courageous, intelligent breed as a hunt companion because of its versatility in various hunt disciplines and aim-to-please attitude.\n\n\n== References ==\n* Burns, Patrick.

It is also known for its strabismus of the eyes. Being both a lap dog and a companion dog, this toy breed has a distinctive heritage.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nWhile most believe that the source breed for the Japanese Chin originated in China, the route by which the Chin arrived in Japan is a widely debated topic. One story claims that the dogs were given to the Japanese royalty in AD 732 as gifts from the rulers of Korea. Others maintain that they were given as gifts to the Empress of Japan as early as the middle of the sixth century or by the seventh century. Still others claim that the Chin first arrived in Japan around the year AD 1000.In Japan, dogs are usually viewed as working or helper animals. The Japanese Chin is unique in that they are owned strictly for companionship. Their distinct appearance and personality eventually captured the hearts of Japanese royalty and resulted in ownership being restricted to those of royal and noble blood.\nEach noble house bred to their own standards. Because of this, there are many variations of the Japanese Chin including size, coat density, eye set, personality, and body type.\nOnce introduced to the West, a strong desire for Japanese Chin that were ten lbs. or less led to this weight becoming the standard of various kennel clubs around the world. Professor Ludwig von Schulmuth studied canine origins by looking at the skeletal remains of dogs found in human settlements as early as the 8th millennium BC. The professor created a genealogical tree of Tibetan dogs that shows the \"Gobi Desert Kitchen Midden Dog\", a scavenger, which evolved into the \"Small Soft-Coated Drop-Eared Hunting Dog\". From this evolved the Tibetan Spaniel, Pekingese, and the Japanese Chin. Another branch coming down from the \"Kitchen Midden Dog\" gave rise to the Papillon and long-haired Chihuahua and yet another \"Kitchen Midden Dog\" branch to the pug and Shih Tzu.Though there is some documentation that indicates Portuguese sailors introduced the breed to Europe in the 17th century by presenting them to Catherine of Braganza, Queen Consort to King Charles II of England, there is more credible evidence that the first Japanese Chin were given as gifts by the Emperor of Japan to an American naval officer, Matthew Calbraith Perry, when Perry visited the Orient in 1853 to open trade with the East. Perry was given a total of seven Japanese Chin, but only two survived the passage back to the USA. It is disputed whether Perry gave the two to Franklin Pierce, President of the United States, or to James Stirling, Rear admiral of the Royal Navy, to take to Queen Victoria or his daughter, Caroline Slidell, after returning from Japan.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nJapanese Chin stand about 20 to 27 cm (8 to 11 inches) in height at the withers. Weight can vary from a low of 1.4 kg (3 lb) to a high of 6.8 kg (15 lb), with an average of 3.2 to 4.1 kg (7 to 9 lb) being the most common.  The American Kennel Club and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale give no weight requirement for the Chin, regardless of the aforementioned desire for lighter dogs. Its distinctive expression is characterized by a large rounded broad head, large wide-set dark eyes, a very short broad muzzle, ear feathering, and evenly patterned facial markings.\n\n\n==== Coat and color ====\n\nMost dogs have two types of hair in their coat: an under and over coat.  However, the Japanese Chin only has an over coat.  An adult coat can take up to two years to completely grow in and can be either black and white, red and white. (Red includes all shades of sable, lemon or orange) or tricolour ( Black and white with reddish tan points) As of 11 November 2011, the colors not listed in the breed standard are grounds for disqualification in competitions.\nThe dogs have a dot or a line on their forehead, which is believed in Japanese history to be the touch of Buddha.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThis breed is considered one of the most cat-like of the dog breeds in attitude: it is alert, intelligent, and independent, and it uses its paws to wash and wipe its face. Other cat-like traits include their preference for resting on high surfaces, their good sense of balance, and their tendency to hide in unexpected places. Japanese Chin are loyal to their owners and are typically a friendly breed.  While Japanese Chin prefer familiar surroundings, they also do well in new situations. This, alongside their friendly demeanor, makes them good therapy dogs. Early socialization of Japanese Chin puppies leads to a more emotionally well-balanced Chin that is more accepting of different situations and people.\nJapanese Chin are defensive animals and thus although they are usually quiet, they will bark to alert the arrival of a visitor or to draw attention to something out of the ordinary.\nJapanese Chin were also bred for the purpose of entertaining their owners. While typically calm, they are well known for performing many tricks such as the \"Chin Spin\", in which they turn around in rapid circles; dancing on their hind legs while pawing their front feet, clasped together, in the air; and some even \"sing\", a noise that can range from a low trill to a higher, almost operatic noise.\n\n\n== Health ==\nCommon health issues in the Japanese Chin include luxating patellas (slipping kneecaps), cataracts, and early-onset heart murmurs. The Chin, as with most small breed dogs, can also have a risk of hypoglycemia when aged under six months or weighing four to five lbs or less. Some Japanese Chin have seasonal allergies.\nThe Japanese Chin's flattened brachycephalic face can lead to breathing and eye problems. Temperature extremes (particularly heat) should therefore be avoided. Its oversized eyes are easily scratched and corneal scratches or more serious ulcerations can result.  Mild scratches benefit from topical canine antibacterial ointment specifically for eye application; more serious injury or ulcerations require urgent medical care.\nThe Japanese Chin Club of America estimates Chins have a typical lifespan of 10\u201312 years, with some living to 15 or more. A UK Kennel Club survey puts their median lifespan at 9.25 years.\n\n\n== Care ==\nThe Japanese Chin's coat requires weekly brushing or combing, with special attention being given to the skirt and the area under the ears and legs. They do not require frequent bathing. These dogs are single-coated and single-hair shedders, and it is very seldom one will find a Chin with an undercoat. A Japanese Chin will have a light blowing of their coat once a year. Without fiber in the diet, they may need to have their anal glands expressed due to them becoming impacted. The skin folds in and around the nose and flattened facial area of a Japanese Chin can trap moisture from its oversized eyes and cause fungal problems. The face should be occasionally wiped with a damp cloth and the folds cleaned with a cotton swab.\nDiet is an important factor in the health and condition of the Japanese Chin, with many of these dogs being very sensitive or allergic to corn. Maintaining a Japanese Chin on a high quality kibble that contains no corn will prevent skin and allergy conditions.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nCompanion Group\nToy Group\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJapanese Chin at Curlie"}, {"id": 267, "name": "Japanese Spitz", "country": "Japan", "type": "Northern Breed", "picture": "dog267", "description": "The Japanese Spitz (\u65e5\u672c\u30b9\u30d4\u30c3\u30c4, Nihon Supittsu) is a small to medium breed of dog of the Spitz type. The Japanese Spitz is a companion dog and pet. There are varying standards around the world as to the ideal size of the breed, but they are always larger than their smaller cousins, the Pomeranian. They were developed in Japan in the 1920s and 1930s by breeding a number of other Spitz type dog breeds together. They are recognized by the vast majority of the major kennel clubs, except the American Kennel Club due to it being similar appearance to the white Pomeranian dog, American Eskimo Dog and Samoyed Dog. While they are a relatively new breed, they are becoming widely popular due to their favorable temperament and other features.\nThe major health concern is patellar luxation, and a minor recurring concern is that the breed can be prone to runny eyes. They can act as reliable watchdogs, but are a type of companion dog and prefer to be an active part of the family. Although they might appear fluffy, they are a low maintenance breed as dirt does not stick to the coat.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Japanese Spitz is a small dog, around 33 cm (13 ins) at the withers, with a somewhat square body, deep chest, and a very thick, pure white double coat. The coat consists of an outer coat that stands off from the soft inner coat, with fur shorter on the muzzle and ears as well as the fronts of the forelegs and the hindlegs.  A ruff of longer fur is around the dog's neck. It has a pointed muzzle and small, triangular shape prick ears (ears that stand up.) The tail is long, heavily covered with long fur, and is carried curled over and lying on the dog's back. The white coat contrasts with the black pads and nails of the feet, the black nose, and the dark eyes. The large oval (akin to a ginkgo seed) eyes are dark and slightly slanted with white eyelashes, and the nose and lips and eye rims are black. The face of the Japanese Spitz is wedge-shaped.They share a common resemblance with the white Pomeranian dog, Samoyed and American Eskimo Dog.\n\n\n=== Size variations ===\n\nDescription of the ideal size of the breed varies. In Japan, the ideal size for males are described as 30\u201338 cm at the withers, with females somewhat smaller; (the Japanese standard is the one published by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale for international dog competitions.) In the UK, the Kennel Club describes the size as 34\u201337 cm (13.5\u201314.5 in) at the withers with females 30\u201334 cm (12\u201313.5 in), which is the same for the Australian National Kennel Council. In New Zealand (New Zealand Kennel Club), the ideal size is 30\u201340 cm (12\u201316 in) for males, 25\u201335 cm (10\u201314 in) for females. The Canadian Kennel Club states that the size for dogs is 12 inches (30 cm) with females slightly smaller, and the United Kennel Club in the U.S. describes the ideal size as 12 to 15 ins (30.5\u201338.1 cm) for males and 12 to 14 ins (30.5\u201335.6 cm) for females. Minor kennel clubs and other organizations may use any of these ideal sizes or create their own. Japanese Spitz dogs are generally considered larger than their cousins, the Pomeranian.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nDog breeders in Japan in the 1920s and 1930s created the Japanese Spitz by crossbreeding a number of other Spitz breeds to develop the Japanese Spitz. Breeders began with white German Spitz dogs, originally brought over from northeastern China to Japan; they were first exhibited at a dog show in Tokyo in 1921. Between 1925 and 1936 various small white Spitz breeds were imported from around the world and crossed into the developing breed, with the goal of producing an improved breed. The final Standard for the breed was written after World War II, and accepted by the Japan Kennel Club. The breed gained popularity in Japan in the 1950s, and was exported to Sweden in the early 1950s. From there the breed went to England, and the Kennel Club recognized the Japanese Spitz in 1977 in the Utility Group. The Japanese Spitz has spread around the world including to India, Australia, and the United States and is recognized by most of the major kennel clubs in the English speaking world; by the Canadian Kennel Club in Group 6, Non-Sporting, by the New Zealand Kennel Club (Non-Sporting Group), by the Australian National Kennel Council in Group 7 (Non Sporting), and by the United Kennel Club (U.S.) in the Northern Breeds Group. The American Kennel Club does not recognize the Japanese Spitz due to its being close in appearance to a U.S. developed Spitz breed, the American Eskimo Dog. The breed is also recognized by minor registries and clubs.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThey are a healthy breed with very few genetic problems. The main health concern for Japanese Spitz is the development of Patellar luxation, a condition in which the kneecap dislocates out of its normal position. They can also be prone to runny eyes, which is most commonly due to having tear ducts that are too small, or an allergy to long grass or stress. It is rarely caused by any serious eye defect.\n\n\n=== Mortality ===\nLife expectancy is estimated at 10\u201316 years. This makes it one of the longest-lived dog breeds.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nActive, loyal, and bright, the Japanese Spitz are known for their great courage, affection and devotion making them great watchdogs and ideal companions for older people and small children. Most Japanese Spitz are good watch dogs, despite their relatively small size, and they have a tendency to bark to warn of arriving strangers. The Japanese Spitz is first and foremost a companion dog and thrives on human contact and attention, preferring to be a member of the family. They are known as very loyal  dogs. They enjoy being active and love to be in the outdoors. They are intelligent, playful, alert, and obedient, and particularly excellent and loving toward children. Unlike many other dogs, the Japanese Spitz will customarily have his or her tail flipped onto its back. In some cases this is thought to be dominant behaviour, but in the Japanese Spitz case this is normal bearing.\n\n\n== Care ==\nJapanese Spitz can tolerate cold weather but, as it was bred as a companion dog, prefers to live in the house with the warmth of its human family. Though they can live in apartments, they need ample time running around outside off-leash in a safe environment.\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\n\nDue to the texture of their coat, mud and dirt falls off or can be brushed out very easily. However, due to the breed's thick coat, regular brushing is essential.The Japanese Spitz's coat is relatively dry as compared to other breeds. Their coat should be groomed twice a week using a pin brush that reaches to the undercoat, preventing formation of knots. Grooming this breed is relatively easy in contrast to other dog breeds. Their white fur coat has a non-stick texture often described as being similar to Teflon.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJapanese Spitz at Curlie"}, {"id": 268, "name": "Japanese Terrier", "country": "Japan", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog268", "description": "The Japanese Terrier (\u65e5\u672c\u30c6\u30ea\u30a2, Nihon Teria) is a small terrier native to Japan.

It is unclear whether these dogs were Dutch Boerenfox (a Dutch terrier strain, like the Fox Terrier of England or the German Pinscher of Germany) or whether these were dogs brought along by English sailors.  Unlike other descendants of Fox Terriers, the JT seems to have been developed exclusively as a pet.  The dogs became very popular as lap dogs in ports such as Nagasaki, Kobe and Yokohama.According to the Japan Kennel Club (JKC), planned breeding of Japanese Terriers did not begin until around 1920, when fanciers began selective breeding from the progenitor, the Kobe Terrier.  The Japanese Terrier was recognized by the JKC in 1930. The Japanese Terrier is recognized by the Japan Kennel Club and the FCI.  It is little known outside Japan, but does have its admirers in Europe.Although this dog goes by the name of Japanese Terrier it is actually not included in the group of Japanese Spitz.

Jonangi's are known for digging decent sized ditches in ground and staying in it .\n\n\n== Breeding ==\nFemales come on heat once in a year and usual litter size is 3\u20135 puppies.Fertility rate is in line with other Indian Dog breeds\n\n\n== History ==\nLocals believe that duck herders used migrate between Kolleru Lake and Pulicat Lake near Nellore district of Andhra Pradhesh with their Jonangi dogs. Jonangi can also be found around Nellore distric. In other distric of Karnataka this breed was also used as herding dog and hunting dog \n\n\n== Near Extinction ==\nThe Jonangi was once commonly found around Kolleru Lake helping local duck farmers in herding their ducks. Farmers around Kolleru have turned towards much profitable aquaculture and the Jonangi that once helped them herding ducks, no longer have a working function, have been left in semi feral state to survive for themselves.\nThe Jonangi has developed unique fish hunting techniques for its survival, now considered as pest by local Aqua farmers. Local farmers went on killing these dogs to near extinction.\n\n\n== Breed Revival ==\nOnce this breed was found around the entire coastal region of India, now it\u2019s found mostly in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Goa.

The breed is of an early Mastiff type with a solid, pale tan or sabled coat, and a black mask.  According to official Kangal Shepherd Dog organisations in Turkey, including the Cynology Federation of Turkey (K\u00f6pek Irklar\u0131 ve Kinoloji Federasyonu, KIF) and the Ankara Kangal Association (Ankara Kangal Derne\u011fi, ANKADER), Kangals may also be brindle or feature a recessive black tan pattern; with or without a black mask; and/or with white markings.\nWhile the Kangal Shepherd Dog is often referred to as a sheep dog, it is not a herding dog, but rather a flock guardian that lives with the flock of sheep to actively fend off predators of all sizes. Typically used as protection against wolves, bears, and jackals in its native Turkey, the breed has been exported to African countries like Namibia and Kenya in more recent years due to its intimidating size and capabilities as an effective guardian, where it successfully protects local herds from lions, cheetahs, and similar indigenous big cats, which has had the benefit of not only protecting livestock, but ensuring the continuity of endangered predators due to reduced cullings by local farmers.The Kangal Shepherd Dog's protectiveness, loyalty, and gentleness with small children and animals has led to its growing popularity as a guardian for families as well, as it regards people as its \"flock\" and guards them with extreme devotion.Historically, the similar the Anatolian Shepherd was treated as a separate breed by many canine registries, but this is now generally treated as part of the same breed population.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe breed's name derives from the contemporary Central Anatolian town of Kangal in Turkey's Sivas Province, and is believed to be from the same root as the Turkic tribe known as the \"Kankalis\". It\u2019s history goes way back to before the Turks settled in Anatolia.\nIndeed, the toponym Kangal and the shepherd dog of the same name appear to have their origins in the Turkic people of Eurasia, specifically the Kankalis branch of the Oghuz Turks. This ethnonym of Kankalis \u2014and its variants, Kangars, Kengers, Kanglys, Kanglis, and Kangils\u2014 which refers to the various Turkic Tatar tribes leaving Turkestan and settling in Anatolia in the latter half of the 9th century CE, ultimately came to be associated with the eponymous Kang territory outlined in Byzantine Emperor Konstantinos Porphyrogennetos' influential domestic and foreign policy manual De Administrando Imperio. These settlers built the commune of Kangal in the area where it is located today. The toponym derives directly from the ethnonym, and evidence is available that tribes designated by such names still exist among Turkic populations.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThere are subtle variations given in the standards used by different countries when describing the height and weight. In the Kangal Shepherd Dog's homeland of Turkey, the only measurements desired are quoted by KIF as a height at the withers of 65 to 78 cm (26 to 31 in) with a two cm tolerance either way. KIF does not differentiate between male and female statistics. Although other standards internationally are fairly consistent with each other, they are at odds with KIF as their guidelines are for a larger dog. In the UK, the Kennel Club interim standard states the height at shoulders should be males 74 to 81 cm (29 to 32 in) with females at 71 to 79 cm (28 to 31 in) without specifying any weight guidelines. The New Zealand Kennel Club quotes height for males as 76 to 81.5 cm (29.9 to 32.1 in) with a weight of 50 to 63 kg (110 to 139 lb) and a bitches height as 71 to 78.5 cm (28.0 to 30.9 in) weighing 41 to 59 kg (90 to 130 lb). In America, the only agency to recognise the breed is the UKC and its standard gives 30 to 32 in (76 to 81 cm) for males, weight 110 to 145 lb (50 to 66 kg) and 28 to 30 in (71 to 76 cm) for females with a weight of 90 to 120 lb (41 to 54 kg).The Kangal Shepherd Dog is not as heavy as some other Mastiff breeds, allowing it greater speed and agility than larger dogs. Kangal Shepherd Dogs can reach speeds of up to 50 km (30 miles) per hour. \nThe under-layer provides insulation against both severe Anatolian winters and the fierce summer sun, while the outer-layer repels water and snow. This combination of coat allows it to regulate its core temperature more efficiently, while the coat is dense enough to repel rupture from wolf bites.\nFurther differences between the KIF standard and those used internationally are found in the guidelines for coat and colour. The registered Kangal Shepherd Dog organizations in Turkey, Cynology Federation Of Turkey (KIF)\u2014to an extent\u2014and Ankara Kangal Derne\u011fi (ANKADER) do not regard coat colour as a breed defining feature. Brindle, recessive black tan pattern, white markings and a longer coat are regarded as Kangal and are not usually indicative of cross breeding, as the KIF standard as significant restrictions on accepted color and is more restrictive with respect to white markings than any of the other international standards, as white markings are only accepted on the chest and on the tip of the tail, whereas standards from other kennel clubs allow white markings on the feet and legs. Rather it is head structure and morphology that differentiate Kangal from other \u00c7oban K\u00f6pegi. In contrast other kennel clubs describe coat and colour as perhaps the most visible traits that distinguish the Kangal from the Akbash and Anatolian. The coat must be short and dense, not long or feathery, and of a pale fawn or tan color with varying amounts of sable guard hairs. All Kangal Shepherd Dogs have a black facial mask, and black or shaded ears. White at certain points (chest, chin, toes) may or may not be allowed, depending on the standard. Some heavily sabled Kangals also have darker legs and chests. Most importantly, the coat should not be broken, brindled, or spotted. \nCropping of the ears is done for several reasons, including the cultural demonstration of ownership vice feral dog, for appearance and for protection, as long ears can be vulnerable in a physical confrontation with a predator. It is also believed that cropping improves the dog's hearing because sound can travel into ear easier. It should be noted the cropping of ears is illegal in the UK.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Kangal Shepherd Dog is calm, controlled, independent, powerful and protective.They may be aloof towards strangers, but a well-socialized Kangal Dog is friendly with visitors and especially children. They must never be shy or vicious. A well-trained Kangal Shepherd Dog is sensitive and alert to changing situations, responding to threats with judicious warnings and courageous action if necessary. They make good guardians of livestock and humans alike, but they may not be suitable for inexperienced dog owners, as the independent intelligence of the Kangal makes for a difficult pupil.\n\n\n=== Protective behavior ===\n\nA working Kangal Shepherd Dog on duty will station itself on a high vantage point overlooking its flock. On hot days, the dog will dig itself a hollow in the ground to keep cool. Novices learn by staying close to older dogs. The dogs will work in pairs or teams depending on the size of the flock, taking up positions around the sheep and changing their positions as needed. The intensity of their patrols around the sheep increases at nightfall.\nWhen suspicious, a Kangal Shepherd Dog will stand with its tail and ears erect and give an alarm call, inciting the sheep to gather around it for protection. The Kangal Shepherd Dog's first instinct is to place itself between the perceived threat and the sheep or master. Once the sheep are safely behind it, the Kangal Shepherd Dog confronts the intruder. When faced with a wolf, the Kangal Shepherd Dog sometimes is successful in intimidating the enemy, but it will resort to a physical confrontation if the predator stands its ground. Specialized wolf killers are known as \"kurt\u00e7ul kangal\" in their homeland.\n\n\n== Kangal Training ==\nThe Kangal dog puppies require an owner who is an expert and will know how to handle dogs and their training. They are not the type of a dog which can be trained by someone else and then think that they will obey you. They require to be trained especially by their master and with that comes living and working with such.\nOne of the really important types of training is a behavioral training. It consists of you getting to know your dog and with that get to know some of his behavioral issues, which could involve barking, chewing, aggression, etc. and try to stop them by training him. This is important because not will you only bond more, but behavioral training is very important part of Kangal puppy.\n\n\n=== Obedience training ===\nNext important type of training is Obedience training. This is a one of the basic and most important training for any dog. There are 3 methods of training that we use with your Kangal puppy, all begins with a strong foundation in the core 5 obedience commands: come, sit, stay, heel, down. Every dog should know these 5 basic obedience commands Because it is very necessary for obedience training.\n\n\n== Kangal/Anatolian Shepherd ==\nThe UK Kennel Club announced it will recognise the Kangal Shepherd Dog as a breed with effect from July 2013. It also stated that dogs currently registered as Anatolian Shepherd Dogs may be eligible (where appropriate) to be recorded as Turkish Kangal Dogs instead.As of 1 January 2012, the Australian National Kennel Council no longer recognises the ANKC Kangal as being a separate breed from the ANKC Anatolian Shepherd.15th June 2018 the FCI effected the one breed population model enacted by the ANKC in 2012, and approved the breed name change of Standard No. 331 Anatolian Shepherd Dog to Kangal Shepherd Dog.  The breed population of FCI Kangal Shepherd Dogs is the same breed population as FCI Anatolian Shepherd Dog.  All FCI Anatolian Shepherd Dogs now have the breed name of: Kangal Shepherd Dog. \n\n\n== The Kangal Shepherd Dog internationally ==\n\nBritain's first Kangal Shepherd Dog litter was produced in 1967 by Gazi of Bakirtollo village and his mate Sabahat of Hay\u0131ro\u011flu village. Dogs from this original line formed the foundation of the so-called \"Seacop\" stock.In October 2012 The Kennel Club announced it will recognise the Kangal Shepherd Dog as a breed and classify it within the Pastoral Group. This will allow the breed to be exhibited at KC licensed events in the UK from July 2013. In December 2012 an interim Breed standard for the breed will be issued. The interim standard was issued in January 2013.In the US, the first purebred breeding programs for Kangal Shepherd Dogs began in the early 1980s. The Kangal Shepherd Dog is recognized by the United Kennel Club in the US, and by the national kennel clubs of South Africa and New Zealand. Many Kangal Shepherd Dogs are being bred in Germany as well, mostly by immigrant workers. Some are registered as Anatolians, that being the only registration option open to them in Germany; most are unregistered.\nOn January 1, 2012, the Australian National Kennel Club discontinued its recognition of the ANKC Kangal Dog as a separate breed to the Anatolian Shepherd Dog.On June 25th 2018, the FCI published the official Kangal Shepherd Dog breed standard to replace the previous Anatolian Shepherd Dog standard. \nIn Namibia the dogs are being used to help protect livestock from cheetah attacks. Around 500 Kangal Shepherd Dogs have been given to farmers in Namibia since 1994 by the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) and the scheme has proved so successful that it has been extended to Kenya. During the past 14 years the number of cheetahs killed by farmers is calculated to have fallen from 19 per farmer annually to 2.4. Livestock losses have been cut significantly at more than 80% of the farms where the dogs have been adopted. The great majority of cheetahs that are still killed by farmers are killed after specific attacks on livestock. Previously, the cats were tracked and killed whenever they neared a farm.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGreat Dane\nAkbash dog\nAksaray Malaklisi dog\nBully Kutta\n\u0160arplaninac\nAnatolian Shepherd\nHerding dog\nGurdbasar dog\nLivestock guardian dog\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nkangal dog breed information\nThe Kangal Dog Club of America\nThe Kangal Dog of Turkey - breed information in English\nSivas Kangalsite of Croatia/Information about history\nViewpoint on the Anatolian, Kangal and Akbash breed debate\nKangal Dogs in Canada\nCenter for Preservation of Indigenous Breeds\nZootechnical analysis of two Kangal population targeted at standardization of Kangal as a Turkish dog breed\nThe official breed standard of Turkish shepherd dog \u2013 Kangal adopted by the Turkish Cynology Association, in 2011. year\nBrochure about Turkish shepherd dog \u2013 Kangal\nKangal breed development in Australia\nKangal Dog Breed Information and Pictures"}, {"id": 273, "name": "Kanni", "country": "India", "type": "", "picture": "dog273", "description": "The Kanni (pronunciation ) - also known as the Maiden's Beastmaster - is a rare indigenous South Indian sighthound breed of dog found in the state of Tamil Nadu.

Other names are Ovcharsko kuche and Thracian Mollos.  The dog is named after the Karakachans, Balkan nomadic shepherds. Due to their conservative stock-breeding traditions, they have preserved some of the oldest breeds of domestic animals in Europe: the Karakachan sheep, Karakachan horse and the Karakachan dog. \nIn the past, this mountain dog was widely used in Bulgaria as a border army watchdog. Nowadays it is used primarily as a livestock guardian dog and property guard dog. The most numerous populations of working purebred livestock guarding Karakachan dogs are found in Bulgaria and the United States. The Karakachan was officially approved as a Bulgarian old native breed in 2005. The Karakachan dog may be a descendant of ancient Balkan domestic dogs, possibly since the time of the Thracians.  In ancient Thracian treasures, figures were found of big, longhaired guardian dogs with curled tails. The Karakachan dog is part of the origin of the Bulgarian Shepherd dog, with which it should not be confused. Bulgarian Shepherd dog is new construction result of mixing of Karakachan dogs with some big Eurasian breeds - Caucasian shepherd, Central Asian shepherd, Saint Bernard, Newfoundland, Moscow watchdog(Moskovskaya storozhevaja).\nThe Karakachan is a very old, primitive breed. \nThe Bulgarian Shepherd is crosses.

Its ancestors started forming as early as the third millennium BC. The Karakachan dog is a descendant of the dogs of the Thracians, renowned as stock-breeders. The dog is named after the Karakachans. Due to their conservative stock-breeding traditions, they managed to preserve some of the oldest breeds of domestic animals in Europe \u2013 the Karakachan sheep, the Karakachan horse, and, of course, the Karakachan dog. It is with this name that the Karakachan dog appears in the works of some of the classics of Bulgarian literature, namely Yordan Yovkov, Georgi Raitchev and Yordan Radichkov. In 1938 H. B. Peters wrote about it in the German cynologycal magazine. Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Hundeforschung  The first researcher of the breed was Todor Gajtandjiev, who proposed the standardization of the breed in the 1970s.

Male dogs should have two apparently normal testicles fully descended into the scrotum.\n\n\n== Effectiveness ==\nThe Karakachan belongs to the rare livestock protection breeds. The dogs are effective at flock protection against predation and theft. Since 1998, there have been three cases of successful predator attacks in the flocks provided with dogs for this project. In one flock of 650 sheep, four had been killed, but this was due to the shepherds dividing the flock in half during grazing, and one half had been left without dogs.\nThe Karakachan dog is strictly territorial. It accepts the flock as its territory, wherever it is. Being close to the flock, they become visibly aggressive if the flock is threatened. If a stranger tries to remove an animal from the flock, the dogs will become seriously aggressive. However, when a flock is passing through a village the dogs walk calmly without paying attention to people. There is another reason for the lack of accidents: the tradition of guarding livestock with big, aggressive dogs has always existed in Bulgaria. Everyone knows about them and people simply avoid the flocks, so conflicts do not occur. Also there are dogs, which are not really aggressive towards people, but in the same time are excellent guards against other animal predators. The trends in breeding these dogs are to produce offspring less aggressive towards people.Karakachan dogs are large, long-haired, massive dogs with a well-developed musculature and well-expressed sexual dimorphism. Males are a minimum of 63 cm in height; females at least 60 cm. Karakachan dogs are used as herding dogs to escort and guard sheep and goat herds in Bulgaria. Since 2004, Karakachan dogs guard successfully livestock on many farms in the U.S.\n\n\n== Creation of new breeds ==\nSome amateur dog fans in Bulgaria creating new big dog show breed with which the Karakachan dog should not be confused. These are cross-breeds of Karakachan dogs with giant breeds such as Caucasian Ovcharka, Central Asian Ovcharka, Moscow Watchdog, Saint Bernard, Landseer and Newfoundland. The goal is to create giant, heavy dogs similar in coloration to the native Karakachan dog. These new dogs are bred mostly as pets.\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nWhen U.S. President George W. Bush visited Bulgaria in 2003, Bulgarian side presented him with a karakachan shepherd.\nThe Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov gave a Karakachan dog, called Buffy to Russian PM Vladimir Putin as a gift in 2010.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Putin leaves Bulgaria with a gas deal and a new puppy\".

In its home country, it is regarded as a national treasure. Karelian Bear Dogs will hunt a variety of animals. Its quick reflexes and fearless nature have made it very popular for hunting aggressive game, including bears, moose, and wild boar. It was the breed's ability to hunt and offer protection from bears that earned the breed its name. The Karelian Bear Dog is among the top 10 most common dog breeds in Finland. \n\n\n== History ==\nAccording to archaeological records, dogs very similar to the modern Russo-European Laika and the Karelian Bear Dog have existed in northeastern Europe and Scandinavia since Neolithic times.  The breed standard for Karelian Bear Dogs and Laikas today calls for a black-and-white marked dog, but originally the breed included individuals with coats of wolf gray of various shades, red coats like the standard spitz, and black-and-tan specimens as well. The Karelian Bear dog has been found in Viking era graves in Denmark, Brittany, and the Isle of Man. This shows the popularity of the breed historically as a working dog. The custom was to bury the dog with their master so that they accompany them to the afterlife. The Karelian Bear Dog was used mainly for hunting small fur-bearing animals, such as squirrels and marten. Like the Norwegian Elkhound, the Karelian Bear Dog was also used in hunting moose, lynx, wolf and, as its name would suggest, hunting the Eurasian brown bear.  In hunting bear, at least a pair of Bear Dogs would be used to harry the animal, barking loudly, in order to distract the bear while the human hunter came in for the kill.\nKarelian Bear Dogs have been used for bear control at Yosemite and Glacier national parks, and with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife.\nKarelian Bear Dogs were introduced in 2004 in Karuizawa, Japan, a popular resort town 170 km northwest of Tokyo, where they reduced the number of bear incidents from 255 in 2006 to four in 2017.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nMales stand 54\u201360 cm (21\u201324 in) at the withers; females are shorter, at 49\u201355 cm (19\u201322 in). Both sexes weigh about 20\u201323 kg (44.1\u201350.7 lbs). The breed has a coat of straight, stiff guard hairs and a fine, soft, thick undercoat. There should be no curl in the hair at all.  The colour should be black with white markings. Often the jet black hair is slightly tinted with brownish highlights on the ends giving it an iridescent quality. The ideal colour percentage is around 70% black and 30% white. The bushy tail curls in a circle over the back in a ring and has a white tip. It falls gently onto the dog's back or to one side. Purebred Karelian Bear Dogs have tails that curve into a circle rather than a sickle. Black speckles in the white sections of fur are considered to be a fault. \n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nKarelian Bear Dogs are naturally aggressive towards other animals. They can require socialization around anything the owner is around often. They are very devoted to their owners,  but can be aggressive towards strangers.  Proper socialization and training is necessary due to their disposition. Karelian Bear Dogs are very territorial and will alert their handler to the presence of any strangers or other animals nearby that they do not know.\nThey are silent but tenacious hunters and alert their handler only when they have the prey at bay. They will keep prey cornered there by barking in a very high, fast bark and running back and forth or around the animal until their handler comes and dispatches it. Karelian Bear Dogs have been known to hold an animal at bay for a very long time.  If a bear tries to leave, the dog will nip at it on the backside and aggravate it to keep it from running away.\nThey don't always have to hunt with their master, as they can be trained to work with other people. However, they are prone to separation anxiety due to their very social nature. It is very unusual for a Karelian Bear Dog to bite a human but it may kill another animal if it feels threatened or hungry. They are very social hunting dogs that prefer an outdoor environment, and need plenty of space to run free and get lots of exercise.  In addition, they need a lot of mental and physical stimulation, as this breed is used to having a job to do.  These traits tend to prevent the breed from becoming popular companion dogs. \n\n\n== Related breeds ==\nFinnish Spitz\nNorrbottenspets\nRusso-European Laika\n\n\n== See also ==\nCombai\nGerman Shepherd\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKarelian Bear Dog non-lethal bear control, Washington USA\nViking Dog Breeds\nAlaska Science Forum on Bear Dogs\nProtection from Bears\nKarelian Bear Dog Information by Finnish Spitz Club"}, {"id": 276, "name": "Karst Shepherd", "country": "Slovenia", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog276", "description": "The Karst Shepherd (Slovene: kra\u0161ki ov\u010dar listen  or kra\u0161evec listen ) is a breed of dog of the livestock guardian type, originating in Slovenia. This Mountain dog breed is recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration cynologique internationale.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Karst Shepherd Dog is of medium size, harmonious, robust, endowed with a well-developed musculature and a strong constitution. The tail and ears are hanging. Length of body in proportion to height at withers should be no less than  9 : 8. Skull is a little longer (13 to 14 cm) than the muzzle (11 to 12 cm / 4.3 to 4.7 in). Width of skull (13 to 14 cm / 5.2 to 5.5 in) is equal to its length.\nTheir hair is well furnished, long, flat, with abundant undercoat. The head the front edges of the ears and the front part of the legs covered with short hair. The back edge of the ears has longer and more supple hair. In its upper region, the neck has long hair, stiff and very bushy forming a mane; in its lower part, the hair is longer and more supple forming a ruff which is wider at the set of the neck. The trunk and belly have long hair which becomes less hard on the belly. The tail regularly bushy, does not form a plume. On the back side of the forequarters, the long hair is very supple forming fringes. On the back side of the hindquarters, the hair is even longer and bushy forming culottes.  The length of the top coat is at least 10 centimetres (3.9 in).\nCoat is iron grey; especially on the back, a dark shade is preferred; towards the belly and the limbs, the colour turns without visible transition to a light grey or sandy colour, with a dark streak on the front parts of the limbs.  The dark mask on the muzzle spreads on to the skull. On the back part of the head it is bordered with grey or sandy or pale fawn hair overlaid with black.\nHeight at the withers for dogs is 57 to 63 cm with an ideal size of 60 centimetres (24 in), and weight is 30 to 42 kg (66 to 92.4 lbs). Females are 54 to 60 cm with an ideal size of 57 centimetres (22 in) and a weight of 25 to 37 kg (55 to 81.4 lbs).\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe breed standard describes the dog as having a sharp temperament and strong individuality, distrustful of strangers. It's a good guard dog. Like all large dogs, the Karst Shepherd needs to be well socialized while very young, with people if the dog is to be a companion, and with livestock if the dog is to be a guardian. If the breed's background is taken into consideration, and if the dog is well socialized and trained, he may make a good family dog. Temperament of individual dogs may vary.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Karst Shepherd is named after the Karst Plateau in Slovenia and more generally after the Karst landscape that extends to Croatia and partly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, from the Gulf of Trieste to the Dinaric Alps. Mostly bred in Slovenia and Istria in Croatia. The ancestral type of the modern day breed travelled with shepherds through this area, and most likely came with ancient nomadic pastoralists. In 1689, the ethnographer Johann Weikhard von Valvasor mentioned the shepherd's dogs of the area in his work The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola without description of dogs. In the 20th century, when the landrace shepherd dogs began to be documented as a modern breed, it was first referred to as the Illyrian Shepherd (1939). Karst Shephard and \u0160arplaninac were considered Type A and B of the Illyrian Shepherd Dog by the Yugoslavian Federation of Cynology for some time, leading to some cases of crossing between both breeds. After comparing typical dogs of both \"Types\" the Federation recognised Karst Shephard and \u0160arplaninac as two distinct breeds in 1968.The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale recognises the breed in Group 2, Section 2.2 Molossoid breeds-Mountain type, number 278. The breed has also been exported to the United States, where it is recognised by The United Kennel Club in the Guardian Dog Group. The breed is also recognised by various minor kennel clubs and internet-based dog registry businesses, and is promoted as a rare breed for those seeking a unique pet.\nDuring the 20th century there were several periods when the number of Karst Shephards was low. Fearing inbreeding a decision was made to introduce a single male Newfoundland into the population. The total number (including puppies, sterilised dogs and dogs not suitable for breeding) of Karst Shepherds in 2008 was estimated between 600 and 700.A breeding program was accepted in 2009 to boost the number of dogs, improve their characteristics and preserve their genetic diversity. To avoid popular sire effect every sire can father up to 3 litters, sire must be unrelated to the dam (no common great grandparents), genetic distance between them must be higher than 0.45. Dogs with heritable diseases, atypical physical and behavioural characteristics are excluded from the program. Exceptions are possible with DLVKOS permission.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\u0160arplaninac\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHome page of Slovenian National Club of Owners and Breeders of Karst Shepherds- DLVKOS- In Slovenian language - please use google translation\nInformation system for Karst Shepherds of Slovenia owned by DLVKOS and Faculty of Biotehnology of Ljubljana (University of Ljubljana)In Slovenian language"}, {"id": 277, "name": "Keeshond", "country": "Netherlands, Germany", "type": "Northern Breed", "picture": "dog277", "description": "The Keeshond ( KAYSS-hond) is a medium-sized dog with a plush, two-layer coat of silver and black fur with a ruff and a curled tail. It originated in Holland, and its closest relatives are the German spitzes such as the Gro\u00dfspitz, Mittelspitz, and Kleinspitz or Pomeranian. The Keeshond was previously known as the Dutch Barge Dog, as it was frequently seen on the barges traveling the canals and rivers of Holland. The Keeshond was the symbol of the Patriot faction in Holland during political unrest in the years immediately preceding the French Revolution.\nIn the late 19th century the breed was developed in England from imports obtained in both Holland and Germany. In 1930 the Keeshond was first registered with The American Kennel Club.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nA member of the spitz group of dogs, the Keeshond in American Kennel Club (AKC) standard is 17 inches (43 cm) to 18 inches (46 cm) tall and 19.25 inches (48.9 cm) \u00b1 2.4 inches (6.1 cm) in the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) standard and weighs 30 pounds (14 kg) to 40 pounds (18 kg). Sturdily built, they have a typical spitz appearance, neither coarse nor refined. They have a wedge-shaped head, a medium-length muzzle with a definite stop, small pointed ears, and an expressive face. The tail is tightly curled and, in profile, should be carried such that it is indistinguishable from the compact body of the dog.\n\n\n==== Coat ====\n\nLike all spitz-type dogs, the Keeshond has a dense double coat, with a thick ruff around the neck. Typically, the males of this breed will have a thicker, more pronounced ruff than the females. The body should be abundantly covered with long, straight, harsh hair standing well out from a thick, downy undercoat. The hair on the legs should be smooth and short, except for a feathering on the front legs and \"trousers\", as previously described, on the hind legs. The hair on the tail should be profuse, forming a rich plume. Head, including muzzle, skull, and ears, should be covered with smooth, soft, short hair\u2014velvety in texture on the ears. Coat must not part down the back.\nCoat care requires line brushing on a fairly regular basis. The Keeshond typically 'blows' its undercoat once a year for males, twice a year for females. During this time, the loss of coat is excessive and their guard hairs will lie flat to their back. It usually takes 2 weeks for the 'blow' to complete, in order for new undercoat to begin growing back in.  A Keeshond should never be shaved, as their undercoat provides a natural barrier against heat and cold. Keeping their coat in good condition will allow efficient insulation in both hot and cold weather.\n\n\n==== Color ====\n\nThe color should be a mixture of grey and black and some white as well. The undercoat should be very pale grey or cream (not tawny). The hair of the outer coat is black tipped, the length of the black tips producing the characteristic shading of color. The color may vary from light to dark, but any pronounced deviation from the grey color is not permissible. The plume of the tail should be very light grey when curled on back and the tip of the tail should be black. Legs and feet should be cream. Ears should be very dark - almost black.\nShoulder line markings (light grey) should be well defined. The color of the ruff and \"trousers\" is generally lighter than that of the body. \"Spectacles\" and shadings, as later described, are characteristic of the breed and must be present to some degree. There should be no pronounced white markings.\nAccording to the American Kennel Club breed standard, the legs and feet are to be cream; feet that are totally black or white are severe faults. Black markings more than halfway down the foreleg, except for pencilling, are faulted.The other important marking is the \"spectacles,\" a delicate dark line running from the outer corner of each eye toward the lower corner of each ear, which, coupled with markings forming short eyebrows, is necessary for the distinct expressive look of the breed. All markings should be clear, not muddled or broken. Absence of the spectacles is considered a serious fault. The eyes should be dark brown, almond-shaped with black eye rims.Ears should be small, dark, triangular, and erect.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nKeeshonden tend to be very playful, with quick reflexes and strong jumping ability. They are thoughtful, eager to please and very quick learners, which means they are also quick to learn things their humans did not intend to teach them. However, Keeshonden make excellent agility and obedience dogs. In fact, so amenable to proper training is this bright, sturdy dog that they have been successfully trained to serve as guide dogs for the blind; only their lack of size has prevented them from being more widely used in this role.\nThey love children and are excellent family dogs, preferring to be close to their humans whenever possible. They generally get along with other dogs as well and will enjoy a good chase around the yard. Keeshonden are very intuitive and empathetic and are often used as comfort dogs. Most notably, at least one Keeshond, Tikva, was at Ground Zero on 9/11 to help comfort the rescue workers. The breed has a tendency to become especially clingy towards their owners, more so than most other breeds. If their owner is out, or in another room behind a closed door, they may sit, waiting for their owner to reappear, even if there are other people nearby. Many have been referred to as their \"owner's shadow,\" or \"velcro dogs\".They are known by their loud, distinctive bark. Throughout the centuries, the Keeshond has been very popular as a watch dog on barges on canals in the Netherlands and middle Europe. This trait is evident to this day, and they are alert dogs that warn their owners of any new visitors. Although loud and alert, Keeshonden are not aggressive towards visitors. They generally welcome visitors affectionately once their family has accepted them. Unfortunately, barking may become a problem if not properly handled. Keeshonden that are kept in a yard, and not allowed to be with their humans, are unhappy and often become nuisance barkers.  \n\n\n==== Training ====\nThe Keeshond is very bright in work and obedience. The Keeshond ranks 16th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of excellent working/obedience intelligence.  This intelligence makes a Keeshond a good choice for the dog owner who is willing to help a dog learn the right lessons, but also entails added responsibility.\nWhile affectionate, Keeshonden are not easy for the inexperienced trainer.  Consistency and fairness are needed; and, while most dogs need a structured environment, it is especially necessary with a Keeshond.  Like most of the independent-minded spitz breeds, Keeshonden respond poorly to heavy-handed or forceful training methods.\nMany behavioral problems with Keeshonden stem from these intelligent dogs inventing their own activities (often destructive ones, like digging and chewing) out of boredom. They need daily contact with their owners and lots of activity to remain happy. The Keeshonden does not live happily alone in a kennel or backyard.\nKeeshonden can also be timid dogs. It is important to train them to respect, but not fear, their owners and family. Keeshonden want to please, so harsh punishment is not necessary when the dog does not obey as quickly as desired. They like to spend time with their owners and love attention.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nKeeshonden are generally a very healthy breed.  Though congenital health issues are not common, the conditions which have been known to sometimes occur in Keeshonden are hip dysplasia, luxating patellas (trick knee), epilepsy, Cushing's disease, diabetes, primary hyperparathyroidism, and hypothyroidism. Von Willebrand's disease has been known in Keeshonden but is very rare. An accurate test for the gene causing primary hyperparathyroidism (or PHPT) has recently been developed at Cornell University. As with any breed, it is important when buying a puppy to make sure that both parents have been tested and certified free from inherited problems. Test results may be obtained from the breeder, and directly from the Orthopaedic Foundation For Animals site.\nKeeshonds in a UK Kennel Club survey had a median lifespan of 12 years 2 months. 1 in 4 died of old age, at an average of 14\u201315 years.\n\n\n== Grooming ==\nBecause of their double coat, Keeshonden need regular brushing; an hour a week will keep the dog comfortable and handsome. The Keeshond's coat sheds dirt when dry, and the breed is not prone to doggy odor, so frequent bathing is unnecessary and undesirable. The coat acts as insulation and protects the dog from sunburn and insects, so shaving is not desirable, however some owners find it beneficial to clip their dogs coats in hotter weather.  The coat also loses its distinct color as the black tipping on the hairs will be shorn off. If frequent brushing is too much effort, it is better to choose another breed rather than clip the Keeshond short.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Keeshond was named after the 18th-century Dutch Patriot, Cornelis (Kees) de Gyselaer (spelled 'Gijzelaar' in Modern Dutch), leader of the rebellion against the House of Orange. The dog became the rebels' symbol; and, when the House of Orange returned to power, this breed almost disappeared. The word 'keeshond' is a compound word: 'Kees' is a nickname for Cornelius (de Gyselaer), and 'hond' is the Dutch word for dog. In the Netherlands, \"keeshond\" is the term for German Spitzes that encompass them all from the toy or dwarf (Pomeranian) to the Wolfspitz (Keeshond). The sole difference among the German Spitzes is their coloring and size guidelines. Although many American references point to the Keeshond as we know it originating in the Netherlands, the breed is cited as being part of the German Spitz family, originating in Germany along with the Pomeranian (toy or dwarf German Spitz) and American Eskimo dog (small or standard German Spitz) according to the FCI.The first standard for \"Wolfspitz\" was posted at the Dog Show of 1880 in Berlin. The Club for German Spitzes was founded in 1899. The German standard was revised in 1901 to specify the characteristic color that we know today, \"silver grey tipped with black\". In the late 19th century the \"Overweight Pomeranian\", a white German Spitz and most likely a Standard German Spitz, was shown in the British Kennel Club. The \"Overweight Pomeranian\" was no longer recognized by the British Kennel Club in 1915. In the 1920s, Baroness van Hardenbroeck took an interest in the breed and began to build it up again. The Nederlandse Keeshond Club was formed in 1924. The Dutch Barge Dog Club of England was formed in 1925 by Mrs. Wingfield-Digby and accepted into the British Kennel Club in 1926, when the breed and the club were renamed to Keeshond.\nCarl Hinderer is credited with bringing his Schloss Adelsburg Kennel, which he founded in 1922 in Germany, with him to America in 1923. His German Champion Wolfspitz followed him two by two in 1926. At that time, less than ten years after World War I, Germany was not regarded fondly in England and America; and the Wolfspitz/Keeshond was not recognized by the AKC. Consequently, Carl had to register each puppy with his club in Germany. Despite this, Carl joined the Maryland KC and attended local shows.\nCarl regularly wrote to the AKC, including the New York headquarters, to promote the Wolfspitz. While going through New York on his way to Germany in 1930, Carl visited the AKC offices and presented Wachter, his Germany champion, to AKC President, Dr. DeMond, who promptly agreed to start the recognition process, with some caveats including changing the name to Keeshond, and asked Carl to bring back all the relevant data from Germany. Carl also translated the German standard to English for the AKC. The Keeshond was accepted for AKC registration in 1930.\nDespite intense lobbying the FCI would not accept the Keeshond as a separate breed since it viewed the Wolfspitz and Keeshond as identical. In 1997, the German Spitz Club updated its standard so that the typically smaller Keeshond preferred in America and other English-speaking countries could be included. This greatly expanded the gene pool and unified the standard internationally for the first time. Now bred for many generations as a companion dog, the Keeshond easily becomes a loving family member.\nAs a result of the breed's history and friendly disposition, Keeshonden are sometimes referred to as \"The Smiling Dutchman\".\n\n\n== Colored Keeshonden ==\nHistorically, Keeshonden being part of the German Spitz family had been interbred with their smaller brethren (small, standard, and dwarf German spitzes) and came in several colors\u2014white, black, red, orange, orange-shaded white (also called orange and cream), and silver gray. Originally, like the other German spitzes, many colors, including piebalds, were allowed, but as time progressed, only the silver-grey and cream (wolf-gray) color was finally established into the Wolfspitz type.While other-colored Keeshonden can have terrific conformation, they are not allowed to be shown in the show ring. Colored Keeshonden are considered \"pet quality\".\nThe appearance of oddly-colored Kees in otherwise wolf-gray litters has caused research into the early history of Keeshond coat colors. Because of this, some breeders wonder whether the Keeshond should be bred for colors other than grey. There are many bloodlines carrying the colored gene, and rather than examples of mixed breeding, colors are legitimate throwbacks to an earlier era of the breed.\nNo one knows the exact number of colored Keeshonden born in the United States. Incorrect or incomplete documentation make it impossible to determine how many colored Keeshonden, and of which colors, have been born in the United States.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nKeeshond at Curlie\nKeeshond World Online Magazine and Pedigree Database"}, {"id": 278, "name": "Kerry Beagle", "country": "Ireland", "type": "", "picture": "dog278", "description": "The Kerry Beagle (Irish: An Pocad\u00e1n Ciarra\u00edoch) is one of the oldest Irish hound breeds, believed to be descendant from the Old Southern Hound or Celtic Hounds.

It is said that the \u201cgadhar,\u201d a dog written about in ancient Irish texts, is a direct ancestor of the Kerry Beagle. Local legend has it that when Noah's ark came to rest against Galtymore, the highest peak in Tipperary, two black and tan hounds scented a fox and leapt off in pursuit, never to be seen again. By the 1800s the Kerry Beagle's numbers had dwindled in Ireland, with only one major pack maintained, the famous Scarteen of County Limerick belonging to the Ryan family, which still exists today.Originally bred as staghounds, today they are used to hunt fox and hare and take part in drag hunting.The Kerry Beagle was taken by many Irish immigrants to the Americas, and is considered a foundation breed in the development of the Coonhounds.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAlderton, David, Hounds of the World, Swan Hill Press, Shrewsbury, 2000, ISBN 1-85310-912-6.\nCunliffe, Juliette, The Encyclopedia of Dog Breeds Parragon, 2001, ISBN 0-7525-6561-3.\nFogle, Bruce, The Encyclopedia of the Dog, DK Publishing, New York, 2009, ISBN 978-0-7566-6004-8.\nHancock, David, Hounds: Hunting by Scent, The Crowood Press Ltd, Marlborough, 2014, ISBN 978-1-84797-601-7.\nHolland, Anne, Hunting:  portrait, Little Brown, London, 2003, ISBN 0-316-86069-7.\n\n\n== External links ==\nScarteen website"}, {"id": 279, "name": "Kerry Blue Terrier", "country": "Ireland", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog279", "description": "The Kerry Blue Terrier (also known as the Irish Blue Terrier) (Irish: An Brocaire Gorm) is a breed of dog. Originally bred to control \"vermin\" including rats, rabbits, badgers, foxes, otters and hares, over time the Kerry became a general working dog used for a variety of jobs including herding cattle and sheep, and as a guard dog. Today the Kerry has spread around the world as a companion and working dog. Despite a Kerry Blue winning Crufts (the most important UK dog show) in 2000, it remains an \"unfashionable\" breed, and is distinctly uncommon; however, it not as threatened as some of the other terrier breeds such as Skye Terrier, Sealyham Terrier, and Dandie Dinmont Terrier.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nSome characteristics of the Kerry Blue Terrier include a long head, flat skull, deep chest, and a soft wavy-to-curly coat that comes in several shades of \"blue\", the general term outside this breed being progressive grey. Puppies are born black; the blue appears gradually as the puppy grows older, usually up to 2 years of age. The male Kerry Blue is usually 46\u201348 cm (18\u201319 in) tall at the withers and weighs 12\u201315 kg (26\u201333 lb), while the female is usually 44\u201346 cm (17\u201318 in) and 10\u201313 kg (22\u201329 lb).\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nThe coat is the key feature of the Kerry. It is soft and wavy with no undercoat. The 'texture' feels like a combination of fine human hair and wool.  It does not shed but continues to grow throughout the year. This means the Kerry Blue requires very regular grooming (at least once per week) and clipping an average of every 6 weeks.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nKerry Blue Terriers are strong-headed and highly spirited. They have always been loyal and affectionate towards their owners and very gentle towards children but were often considered downright mean toward other animals, including other dogs. If they are socialised with other dogs this is no longer the case. In the early days of competitive dog showing, the Irish Kennel Club required Kerries had to pass a \"gameness\" test, known as Teastas Mor certification, before they were deemed worthy of being judged. These tests included catching rabbits and bringing a badger to bay in its set.  They are fast, strong, and intelligent, and they do well in obedience, dog agility, sheep herding, and tracking. They have been used as police dogs in Ireland. Modern breeders have attempted to retain high spirits whilst breeding out aggression.\nAs a long-legged breed, the activity level of the Kerry Blue Terrier ranges from moderate to high. They require an active, skilled owner who can provide them with early socialisation and obedience training. Kerries require daily exercise.\nThe Kerry is said to have an amazing sense of humour or even a \"touch of the blarney\".  Ideally, owners should have a sense of humour themselves to fully appreciate a Kerry \u2014 \"to be owned by a Kerry\" is a famous quote in Kerry circles.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nKerries are fairly healthy, but there are some genetic disorders that are prevalent in the breed. They are prone to eye problems such as Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes), cataracts, and entropion. They sometimes get cysts or tumorous growths in their skin, but these are rarely malignant. Hip dysplasia, hypothyroidism, cryptorchidism have also been reported occasionally. Progressive neuronal abiotrophy (PNA) is also seen but rare in the population. This condition is also referred to as Cerebellar cortical abiotrophy (CCA) or Cerebellar Abiotrophy (CA). Another skin-related health issue is spiculosis though this has been successfully bred out by some breeders. This is a skin disorder that produces abnormally thick hairs that are also called thorns, spikes or bristles. A U.S. breed club survey puts the average lifespan at 9 1/2 years. Many live to 13 or 14 years.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Kerry Blue Terrier was first observed in the mountains of Kerry in Ireland, hence the name of the breed. There is a romantic story of a blue dog swimming ashore from a shipwreck: the coat of this dog was so lovely that it was mated with all the female Wheaten Terriers in Kerry (or in all Ireland, according to some), producing the Kerry Blue. Perhaps this story is not entirely myth, as the Portuguese Water Dog is often suggested as part of the Kerry's makeup. Others suggest the Kerry was produced by the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier crossed with the Bedlington Terrier with (or without) some Irish Wolfhound or Irish Terrier blood. The extinct Gadhar herding dog is also mentioned as another possible branch of the Kerry's family tree. One certain fact is the breed became very popular as an all-around farm dog in rural Ireland.\n\n\n=== National Dog of Ireland ===\nWith the development of dog shows in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the breed became standardised and \"tidied up\" for the show ring. The Irish nationalist leader Michael Collins owned a famous Kerry Blue named Convict 224. Collins even made an attempt to have the Kerry blue adopted as the national dog of Ireland. Love of dogs did, however, cross political divides. The first show of the Dublin Irish Blue Terrier club took place outside official curfew hours and was entered both by those fighting for and against an Ireland republic. The Dublin Irish Blue Terrier Club was so successful it led directly to the foundation of the Irish Kennel Club, and a Kerry blue was the first dog that club registered.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBadger-baiting \u2013 Kerrys were once used for this sport.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKerry Blue Terrier at Curlie"}, {"id": 280, "name": "King Charles Spaniel", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog280", "description": "The King Charles Spaniel (also known as the English Toy Spaniel) is a small dog breed of the spaniel type. In 1903, the Kennel Club combined four separate toy spaniel breeds under this single title. The other varieties merged into this breed were the Blenheim, Ruby and Prince Charles Spaniels, each of which contributed one of the four colours available in the breed.\nThought to have originated in the Far East, toy spaniels were first seen in Europe during the 16th century. They were made famous by their association with King Charles II of Great Britain and Ireland (1630\u20131685) and have been linked with British royalty since the time of Queen Mary I (1516\u20131558). Members of the breed were owned by Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia.\nThe King Charles Spaniel and the other types of toy spaniels were crossbred with the Pug in the early 19th century to reduce the size of the nose, as was the style of the day. The 20th century saw attempts to restore lines of King Charles Spaniels to the breed of Charles II's time. These included the unsuccessful Toy Trawler Spaniel and the now popular Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The Cavalier is slightly larger, with a flat head and a longer nose, while the King Charles is smaller, with a domed head and a flat face.\nHistorically the breeds that were merged into the King Charles Spaniel were used for hunting; due to their stature they were not well suited. They have kept their hunting instincts, but do not exhibit high energy and are better suited to being lapdogs. The modern breed is prone to several health problems, including cardiac conditions and a range of eye problems.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIt is thought that the toy spaniels that eventually became the King Charles Spaniel originated in the Far East, primarily Japan. They may share a common ancestry with the Pekingese and Japanese Chin. Toy spaniels were given as gifts to European royalty.The red and white variety of toy spaniel was first seen in paintings by Titian, including the Venus of Urbino (1538), where a small dog is used as a symbol of female seductiveness. Further paintings featuring these toy spaniels were created by Palma Vecchio and Paolo Veronese during the 16th century. These dogs already had high domed heads with short noses, although the muzzles were more pointed than they are today. These Italian toy spaniels may have been crossed with local small dogs such as the Maltese and also with imported Chinese dogs. The Papillon is the continental descendant of similar toy-sized spaniels.The earliest recorded appearance of a toy spaniel in England was in a painting of Queen Mary I and King Philip. Mary, Queen of Scots (1542\u20131587), was also fond of small toy dogs, including spaniels, showing the fondness of the British royalty for these types of dogs before Charles II.King Henry III of France (1551\u20131589) owned a number of small spaniels, which were called Damarets. Although one of the translations of John Caius' 1570 Latin work De Canibus Britannicis talks of \"a new type of Spaniel brought out of France, rare, strange, and hard to get\", this was an addition in a later translation, and was not in the original text. Caius did discuss the \"Spainel-gentle, or Comforter\" though, which he classified as a delicate thoroughbred. This spaniel was thought to originate from Malta and was sought out only as a lapdog for \"daintie dames\".Captain John Saris may have brought back examples of toy spaniels from his voyage to Japan in 1613, a theory proposed by Commodore Matthew C. Perry during his expeditions to Japan on behalf of the United States in the mid-19th century. He noted that dogs were a common gift and thought that the earlier voyage of Captain Saris introduced a Japanese type of spaniel into England.\n\n\n=== 17th century and Charles II ===\n\nIn the 17th century, toy spaniels began to feature in paintings by Dutch artists such as Caspar Netscher and Peter Paul Rubens. Spanish artists, including Juan de Vald\u00e9s Leal and Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, also depicted them; in the Spanish works, the dogs were tricolour, black and white or entirely white. French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon would later describe these types of dogs as crosses between spaniels and Pugs.Charles II of England was very fond of the toy spaniel, which is why the dogs now carry his name, although there is no evidence that the modern breeds are descended from his particular dogs. He is credited with causing an increase in popularity of the breed during this period. Samuel Pepys' diary describes how the spaniels were allowed to roam anywhere in Whitehall Palace, including during state occasions. In an entry dated 1 September 1666, describing a council meeting, Pepys wrote, \"All I observed there was the silliness of the King, playing with his dog all the while and not minding the business.\" Charles' sister Princess Henrietta was painted by Pierre Mignard holding a small red and white toy-sized spaniel. Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth, writing in her 1911 work Toy Dogs and Their Ancestors, theorised that after Henrietta's death at the age of 26 in 1670, Charles took her dogs for himself.\n\n\n=== After Charles II ===\n\nToy spaniels continued to be popular in the British court during the reign of King James II, through that of Queen Anne. Popular types included those of the white and red variety. Following the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and the reign of King William III and Queen Mary II, the Pug was introduced into Britain which would eventually lead to drastic physical changes to the King Charles Spaniel. Comparisons between needlework pictures of English toy spaniels and the continental variety show that changes had already begun to take place in the English types by 1736, with a shorter nose being featured and the breed overall moving away from the one seen in earlier works by Anthony van Dyck during the 17th century.English toy spaniels remained popular enough during the 18th century to be featured frequently in literature and in art. On Rover, a Lady's Spaniel, Jonathan Swift's satire of Ambrose Philips's poem to the daughter of the Lord Lieutenant, describes the features of an English toy, specifying a \"forehead large and high\" among other physical characteristics of the breeds. Toy spaniels and Pugs were featured in both group portraits and satirical works by William Hogarth. Toy spaniels were still popular with the upper classes as ladies' dogs, despite the introduction of the Pug; both Thomas Gainsborough's portrait of Queen Charlotte from 1781 and George Romney's 1782 Lady Hamilton as Nature feature toy spaniels with their mistresses. The toy spaniels of this century weighed as little as 5 pounds (2.3 kg), although they were thought to be the dog breed most prone to becoming overweight, or \"fattened\".\n\n\n=== 19th century and the Blenheim Spaniel ===\n\nThe varieties of toy spaniel were occasionally used in hunting, as the Sportsman's Repository reported in 1830 of the Blenheim Spaniel: \"Twenty years ago, His Grace the Duke of Marlborough was reputed to possess the smallest and best breed of cockers in Britain; they were invariably red\u2013and\u2013white, with very long ears, short noses, and black eyes.\" During this period, the term \"cocker\" was not used to describe a Cocker Spaniel, but rather a type of small spaniel used to hunt woodcock. The Duke's residence, Blenheim Palace, gave its name to the Blenheim Spaniel. The Sportsman's Repository explains that toy spaniels are able to hunt, albeit not for a full day or in difficult terrain: \"The very delicate and small, or 'carpet spaniels,' have exquisite nose, and will hunt truly and pleasantly, but are neither fit for a long day or thorny covert.\" This idea was supported by Vero Shaw in his 1881 work The Illustrated Book of the Dog, and by Thomas Brown in 1829 who wrote, \"He is seldom used for field\u2013sports, from his diminutive size, being easily tired, and is too short in the legs to get through swampy ground.\" During the 19th century, the Maltese was still considered to be a type of spaniel, and thought to be the parent breed of toy spaniels, including both the King Charles and Blenheim varieties.The breeds of toy spaniel often rivalled the Pug in popularity as lapdogs for ladies. The disadvantage of the breeds of toy spaniel was that their long coats required constant grooming. By 1830, the toy spaniel had changed somewhat from the dogs of Charles II's day. William Youatt in his 1845 study, The Dog, was not enamoured of the changes: \"The King Charles's breed of the present day is materially altered for the worse. The muzzle is almost as short, and the forehead as ugly and prominent as the veriest bull-dog. The eye is increased to double its former size, and has an expression of stupidity with which the character of the dog too accurately corresponds.\" Youatt did concede that the breed's long ears, coat and colouring were attractive. Due to the fashion of the period, the toy spaniels were crossed with Pugs to reduce the size of their noses and then selectively bred to reduce it further. By doing this, the dog's sense of smell was impaired, and according to 19th century writers, this caused the varieties of toy spaniel to be removed from participation in field sports. Blunt-Lytton proposed that the red and white Blenheim Spaniels always had the shorter nose now seen in the modern King Charles.\n\nFrom the 16th century, it was the fashion for ladies to carry small toy-sized spaniels as they travelled around town. These dogs were called \"Comforters\" and given the species biological classification of Canis consolator by 19th-century dog writers. By the 1830s, this practice was no longer in vogue, and these types of spaniels were becoming rarer. \"Comforter\" was given as a generic term to lapdogs, including the Maltese, the English Toy and Continental Toy Spaniels, the latter of which was similar to the modern Phal\u00e8ne. It was once believed that the dogs possessed some power of healing: in 1607 Edward Topsell repeated Caius' observation that \"these little dogs are good to asswage the sickness of stomach, being oftentimes thereunto applied as a plaister preservative, or bourne in the bosum of the diseased and weak person, which effect is performed by their moderate heat.\" By the 1840s, \"Comforter\" had dropped out of use, and the breed had returned to being called Toy Spaniels. The first written occurrence of a ruby coloured toy spaniel was a dog named Dandy, owned by a Mr Garwood in 1875.The dogs continued to be popular with royalty. In 1896, Otto von Bismarck purchased a King Charles Spaniel from an American kennel for $1,000. The dog weighed less than 2 pounds (0.9 kg), and had been disqualified from the Westminster Kennel Club the previous year on account of its weight. The average price was lower than that paid by Bismarck. In 1899, the price ranged between $50 and $200 for a King Charles or Blenheim, with the Ruby and Prince Charles Spaniel ranging between $50 and $150.Anne Bront\u00eb's \"Flossy,\" given to her by the Robinson children when she left her governorship of them, was a King Charles Spaniel.\n\n\n=== Conformation showing and the 20th century ===\n\nIn 1903, the Kennel Club attempted to amalgamate the King James (black and tan), Prince Charles (tricolour), Blenheim and Ruby spaniels into a single breed called the Toy Spaniel. The Toy Spaniel Club, which oversaw those separate breeds, strongly objected, and the argument was only resolved following the intervention of King Edward VII, who made it clear that he preferred the name \"King Charles Spaniel\". In 1904, the American Kennel Club followed suit, combining the four breeds into a single breed known as the English Toy Spaniel. The Japanese Spaniel was also considered a type of toy spaniel, but was not merged into the new breed and was recognised as a breed in its own right.Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia owned a King Charles Spaniel at the time of the shooting of the Romanov family on 17 July 1918. Eight days later, Nicholas Sokolov of the White Forces found a clearing where he believed the bodies of the Romanov family had been burnt, and discovered the corpse of a King Charles Spaniel at the site. In 1920s, the Duchess of Marlborough bred so many King Charles Spaniels at Blenheim Palace that her husband moved out and later evicted the Duchess herself.Blunt-Lytton documented her attempts in the early 20th century to re-breed the 18th-century type of King Charles Spaniel as seen in the portraits of King Charles II. She used the Toy Trawler Spaniel, a curly haired, mostly black, small to medium-sized spaniel, and cross-bred these dogs with a variety of other breeds, including Blenheim Spaniels and Cocker Spaniels, in unsuccessful attempts to reproduce the earlier style.\n\nThe Cavalier King Charles Spaniel originated from a competition held by American Roswell Eldridge in 1926. He offered a prize fund for the best male and female dogs of \"Blenheim Spaniels of the old type, as shown in pictures of Charles II of England's time, long face, no stop, flat skull, not inclined to be domed, with spot in centre of skull.\" Breeders entered what they considered to be sub-par King Charles Spaniels. Although Eldridge did not live to see the new breed created, several breeders banded together and created the first breed club for the new Cavalier King Charles Spaniel in 1928, with the Kennel Club initially listing the new breed as \"King Charles Spaniels, Cavalier type\". In 1945, the Kennel Club recognised the new breed in its own right. The American Kennel Club did not recognise the Cavalier until 1997.Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, continued the connection between royalty and the King Charles Spaniel, attending Princess Anne's tenth birthday party with her dog Rolly in 1960. Elizabeth II has also owned King Charles Spaniels in addition to the dogs most frequently associated with her, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi.\n\nIn 2008, the BBC documentary Pedigree Dogs Exposed was critical of the breeding of a variety of pedigree breeds including the King Charles Spaniel. The show highlighted issues involving syringomyelia in both the King Charles and Cavalier breeds. Mark Evans, the chief veterinary advisor for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), said, \"Dog shows using current breed standards as the main judging criteria actively encourage both the intentional breeding of deformed and disabled dogs and the inbreeding of closely related animals\"; this opinion was seconded by the Scottish SPCA. Following the programme, the RSPCA ended its sponsorship of the annual Crufts dog show, and the BBC declined to broadcast the event.The King Charles Spaniel is less popular than the Cavalier in both the UK and the US. In 2010, the Cavalier was the 23rd most popular breed, according to registration figures collected by the American Kennel Club, while the English Toy Spaniel was the 126th. In the UK, according to the Kennel Club, the Cavalier is the most popular breed in the Toy Group, with 8,154 puppies registered in 2010, compared to 199 registrations for King Charles Spaniels. Due to the low number of registrations, the King Charles was identified as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club in 2003 in an effort to help promote the breed.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe King Charles has large dark eyes, a short nose, a high domed head and a line of black skin around the mouth. On average, it stands 9 to 11 inches (23 to 28 cm) at the withers, with a small but compact body. The breed has a traditionally docked tail. It has the long pendulous ears typical of a spaniel and its coat comes in four varieties,  trait it shares with its offshoot, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.\n\nThe four sets of markings reflect the four former breeds from which the modern breed was derived. Black and tan markings are known as \"King Charles\", while \"Prince Charles\" is tricoloured, \"Blenheim\" is red and white, and \"Ruby\" is a single-coloured solid rich red. The \"King Charles\" black and tan markings typically consist of a black coat with mahogany/tan markings on the face, legs and chest and under the tail. The tricoloured \"Prince Charles\" is mostly white with black patches and mahogany/tan markings in similar locations to the \"King Charles\". The \"Blenheim\" has a white coat with red patches, and should have a distinctive red spot in the center of the skull.King Charles Spaniels are often mistaken for Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. There are several significant differences between the two breeds, the principal being the size. While the Cavalier weighs on average between 13 to 18 pounds (5.9 to 8.2 kg), the King Charles is smaller at 8 to 14 pounds (3.6 to 6.4 kg). In addition, their facial features, while similar, are distinguishable: the Cavalier's ears are set higher and its skull is flat, while the King Charles' is domed. Finally, the muzzle length of the King Charles tends to be shorter than the typical muzzle on a Cavalier.The American Kennel Club has two classes, English Toy Spaniel (B/PC) (Blenheim and Prince Charles) and English Toy Spaniel (R/KC), while in the UK, the Kennel Club places the breed in a single class. Under the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale groups, the King Charles is placed in the English Toy Spaniel section within the Companion and Toy Dog Group, along with the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe King Charles is a friendly breed, to the extent that it is not typically as suitable as a watchdog as some breeds, though it may still bark to warn its owners of an approaching visitor. It is not a high energy breed, and enjoys the company of family members, being primarily a lapdog. Although able to bond well with children and tolerant of them, it will not accept rough handling. It prefers not to be left alone for long periods. Known as one of the quietest toy breeds, it is suitable for apartment living.The breed can tolerate other pets well, although the King Charles still has the hunting instincts of its ancestors and may not always be friendly towards smaller animals. It is intelligent enough to be used for obedience work and, due to its stable temperament, it can be a successful therapy dog for hospitals and nursing homes.\n\n\n== Health ==\nA natural bobtail can be found in some members of the breed, which is not a mutation of the T-box gene, and so is allowed under conformation show rules. Health-related research on the breed has been limited, with no major studies conducted in Britain. However, it has been included in studies outside the UK, including by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) in the United States. The King Charles Spaniel has a number of eye and respiratory system disorders common to brachycephalic dogs, and endocrine and metabolic diseases common to small breeds, as well as specific breed-associated health conditions. The average lifespan is 10 to 12 years, and the breed should be able to reproduce naturally.\n\n\n=== Eye and heart conditions ===\nThe eye problems associated with the King Charles Spaniel include cataracts, corneal dystrophy, distichia, entropion, microphthalmia, optic disc drusen, and keratitis. Compared to other breeds, the King Charles Spaniel has an increased risk of distichia (where extra eyelashes or hairs cause irritation to the eye). Inheritance is suspected in the other conditions, with ages of onset ranging from six months for cataracts to two to five years for corneal dystrophy.Heart conditions related to the King Charles Spaniel include mitral valve disease, in which the mitral valve degrades, causing blood to flow backwards through the chambers of the heart and eventually leading to congestive heart failure. Patent ductus arteriosus, where blood is channelled back from the heart into the lungs, is also seen and can lead to heart failure. Both of these conditions present with similar symptoms and are inheritable. The OFA conducted a survey on cardiac disease, where of 105 breeds, the King Charles Spaniel was found to be 7th worst, with 2.1% of 189 dogs affected.\n\n\n=== Other common issues ===\nBeing a brachycephalic breed, King Charles Spaniels can be sensitive to anesthesia. This is because in brachycephalic dogs, there is additional tissue in the throat directly behind the mouth and nasal cavity, known as the pharynx, and anesthesia acts as a muscle relaxant causing this tissue to obstruct the dogs' narrow airways. These narrow airways can decrease the dogs' ability to exercise properly and increase their susceptibility to heat stroke. Other congenital and hereditary disorders found in the King Charles Spaniel are hanging tongue, where a neurological defect prevents the tongue from retracting into the mouth; diabetes mellitus, which may be associated with cataracts; cleft palate and umbilical hernia. The English Toy Spaniel Club of America recommends that umbilical hernias be corrected only if other surgery is required, due to the risk of surgery in brachycephalic breeds. In another study conducted by the OFA, the King Charles Spaniel was the 38th worst of 99 breeds for patella luxation; of 75 animals tested, 4% were found to have the ailment. However, surveys conducted by the Finnish breed club between 1988 and 2007 found that the occurrences were higher in some years, ranging from 5.3% to 50%.There are several breed traits which may cause concern as health issues. They include skull issues such as an open fontanelle, where in young dogs there is a soft spot in the skull; it is common in dogs under a year old. A complication from that condition is hydrocephalus, also known as water on the brain. This condition may cause neurological symptoms that require the dog to be euthanised. Fused toes, where two or more of the dog's toes are fused together, may seem to be a health issue but this breed trait is not a cause for concern.\n\n\n== Urban myth ==\nAn urban legend claims that Charles II issued a special decree granting King Charles Spaniels permission to enter any establishment in the UK, overriding \"no dog except guide dogs\" rules.  A variant of this myth relates specifically to the Houses of Parliament. This myth is sometimes instead applied to the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.The UK Parliament website states: \"Contrary to popular rumour, there is no Act of Parliament referring to King Charles spaniels being allowed anywhere in the Palace of Westminster. We are often asked this question and have thoroughly researched it.\" Similarly, there is no proof of any such law covering the wider UK.  A spokesman for the Kennel Club said: \"This law has been quoted from time to time. It is alleged in books that King Charles made this decree but our research hasn't tracked it down.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nCavalier King Charles Spaniel\nToy dog\n\n\n== References ==\nSpecific\nGeneral\n\n\n== External links ==\nKing Charles Spaniel at Curlie"}, {"id": 281, "name": "King Shepherd", "country": "United States", "type": "", "picture": "dog281", "description": "The King Shepherd is a dog breed developed from crossing German Shepherd Dog with Shiloh Shepherd and long-coated European lines of German Shepherd along with Malamute in the 1990s.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe King Shepherd is a large breed. According to the American Rare Breeds Association males stand at over 29 inches (74 cm) tall and should have an ideal weight of 130 to 150 pounds (59 to 68 kg) pounds while females are 27 inches (69 cm) tall and ideally 90 to 110 pounds (41 to 50 kg).The build of this dog is muscular, long, and robust; the structure is solid. The head is in good proportion with the body and moderately wide between the eyes. The forehead is slightly rounded. The cheeks are not too full and moderately curved when viewed from the top. The thick, firm ears are medium-sized and moderately wide at base. The eyes are medium-sized and almond shaped. The shades of the eyes can be varying shades of brown ranging from golden brown to almost black. The chest is broad and deep. Thickly feathered, the tail reaches at least to the hocks and is slightly curved. Docked tails are inadmissible. Paws are round and short with a well closed arch. The pads are very hard. The nails are short, strong, and dark-colored. Dewclaws are usually removed. The King Shepherd comes with a wide range of colors: Sable, black saddle with tan, gold, cream, and tan or silver markings. Pale washed-out colors are serious faults. The undercoat has little color except in solid black dogs. White, blue, or liver colored dogs or a dog with a nose that is other than black are not accepted in the show ring. Puppies change color until their final coat. There are two coat varieties - plush-haired and long-haired.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe King Shepherd is self-confident with a well-balanced personality and healthy nervous system. They should not exhibit any shyness or nervousness. They are extremely intelligent, easy to train and eager and faithful to please their owners. This breed makes a fine sheep-herder and working dog. They are also a naturally courageous guard and watchdog, showing courage, strength, and hardiness in their role of protector. They make very nice companions and are friendly to other animals and children.\n\n\n== Care ==\nKing Shepherds are very intelligent and energetic, and needs both challenging mental stimulation and plenty of exercise. The King Shepherd takes well to strenuous activity.\n\n\n== Origin ==\n\nTwo American dog breeders Shelly Watts-Cross, and David Turkheimer created this large breed from the Shiloh Shepherd (American and European German Shepherd Dogs and Alaskan Malamutes), additional American-bred German Shepherd Dogs and the Great Pyrenees. An organized dog breed club was started in 1995.\n\n\n== Other information ==\nThe King Shepherd's life expectancy is 10\u201314 years. King Shepherds are classified in the herding group and have recognition by: ARBA, AKSC, WWKC, ERBDC, SKC, and the APRI.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 282, "name": "Kintamani (dog)", "country": "Indonesia", "type": "", "picture": "dog282", "description": "The Kintamani is a dog native to the Indonesian island of Bali.  It is a popular pet for the Balinese and locally Bali's only official breed and efforts are currently under way to have the dog accepted by the Federation Cynologique Internationale as a recognized breed. It is an evolving breed indigenous to the Kintamani region which evolved from the local Bali street dogs, which are a feral random-bred landrace distinctive to Bali.\n\n\n== Genetic evidence ==\nGenetic studies have shown that, despite evidence to the contrary, the Kintamani dog is native to Bali. Thirty-one highly polymorphic short tandem repeat markers from Kintamani dogs,  Bali street dogs, Australian dingoes, and nine American Kennel Club (AKC) recognized breeds of northeast Asian or European origin were compared. The Kintamani dog was identical to the Bali street dog at all but three loci. The Bali street dog and Kintamani dog were most closely aligned with the Australian dingo, more distantly related to AKC recognized breeds of Chinese origin, and most distantly related to AKC breeds from western Eurasia.  Therefore, the Kintamani dog has evolved from Balinese feral dogs with little loss of genetic diversity.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThese results come despite observable facts about the Kintamani Dog that make them more similar to breeds from elsewhere and which set them apart from the average village dog; facts which had lent credence to a local folk belief that the breed originated 600 years ago from a Chinese Chow Chow brought from abroad.\nThe Kintamani looks something like a mix between the Samoyed and a Malamute. They have long hair, a broad face, a flat forehead, and flat cheeks like Chinese dogs such as the Chow Chow and are amenable to life as a pet.  Whilst many live much the same kind of life as an average village dog, they dig holes to nest their young and some live in small caves among the boulders around Kintamani. They are locally considered good-looking dogs are more often sought after as good pets. The Kintamani dog is gentle around people, yet retains enough assertive behavior to render it a noteworthy (but not vicious) watchdog.\n\nThe most desired and only officially accepted coat color is white - preferably with apricot-tipped ears. Breeders often confine the dogs to cold dark caves near the Kintamani volcano, insisting it an essential step in developing the thick white coat. However, other coat colors, such as black, beige, and brindle exist.\nThe withers height of the female Kintamani dog is 40\u201350 cm, 45\u201355 cm for the male, about the same as the stature of the Bali street dog. The desired physical traits of the Kintamani dog include erect ears, forwardly curved tail held at the midline, medium to longhaired coat, almond-shaped brown eyes, and black skin pigment.\nBali street dogs come in many colors and coat patterns, and they are almost always shorthaired and straight- to curve- tailed. Both still whelp in burrows dug into the earth, a feral dog trait.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nA fiercely independent breed, Kintamanis can be aggressively territorial while at the same time tender and affectionate with their own families. While most dog breeds are disinclined to climbing and heights, Kintamanis will climb across roofs and spend parts of the day happily installed sitting or sleeping atop a garden wall. They are light-footed and move freely, smoothly and lithely, and will bark when confronted with an unfamiliar sound or sight.\n\n\n== History ==\nGenetic studies of the breed have shown that has probably evolved from local Balinese feral dogs, and is distantly related to other Asian breeds.It is also possible that the Kintamani Dog came with the Javanese invaders from the kingdom of Majapahit in 1343 or with the Javanese refugees of the civil war in the 15th century. But of all the hypotheses, about the origins of the Kintamani Dog, only one is really plausible: that sometime between the 12th and the 16th century a Chinese trader named Lee landed in Singaraja in Northern Bali, bringing with him a Chow Chow dog which bred with the local Balinese feral dogs. Lee later in settled in the Kintamani region and raised his family there. Evidence that the Lee family lived in Kintamani exists in the form of a Chinese temple in which people of the Confucian faith still worship.\n\n\n== Accreditation ==\nIn order to get international accreditation for the breed the Bangli Regency authority facilitates the Kintamani Dog Exhibition and Contest every year to promote the Kintamani Dog. The authority also guides Kintamani Dog breeders, makes rules about Kintamani Dog purification areas and has made a demonstration pilot project in some villages.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Indonesia-related topics\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKintamani"}, {"id": 283, "name": "Kishu", "country": "Japan", "type": "Northern Breed", "picture": "dog283", "description": "The Kishu (\u7d00\u5dde\u72ac, Kish\u016b-Inu), sometimes called Kishu Ken or Kishu Inu, is a Japanese breed of dog, developed there for thousands of years. It is descended from ancient medium-sized breeds and named after the Kishu region, now Mie Prefecture and Wakayama Prefecture. This breed is similar to the Hokkaido, Shikoku and the Kai Ken. Sometimes it is mistaken for the white variant of Hokkaido because of very similar appearance. The Japanese originally used this breed of dog for boar and deer hunting. Like the Shiba, they are often quiet. Kishu will stalk prey quietly rather than bark.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Kishu stands 17-22 inches (43\u201355 cm) tall, averages 30\u201360 pounds and is considered a medium-sized dog. The standard only permits solid colored dogs to be shown. Accepted show colors are white, sesame, red, and black & tan (NIPPO only). White is the most common color in the breed. There is only one standard which illustrates white as the preferred coat color. The nose color is black, but with the white coats, flesh-colored noses are permitted. The bite is either scissor or a level bite. The tail is either carried in a sickle or curled over the back. The coat is short, straight, and coarse with a thick undercoat. There is fringe on the cheeks and tail. The ears incline forward and are smaller rather than larger, but should maintain proportion with the head and dog overall.  This breed is tough, agile and friendly.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nKishu Ken are a one person/one family dog. They are courageous and brave as hunters, and will be loyal to their owners. They have a strong prey drive, and will hunt small animals. A few have been known to do well with cats if raised with them. They do well with other dogs if socialized well as puppies, however, Kishu may become combative with other dogs who do not respect their boundaries, or become combative with other dogs when frustrated. They are quite headstrong and willful, making training necessary, but they are devoted and loyal to family, getting along well with children, if raised with them. Kishu Ken like to keep an eye on whatever is going on, and sometimes find a high place to look out from. They can be aloof or shy around strangers. They are easily housebroken, intelligent, and strong willed.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Kishu Ken is a fairly healthy dog breed that does not suffer from health conditions common to more popular and refined breeds, but there is still very limited data on the breed in or out of its country of origin. Current data through the public Finnish health database KoiraNet suggests that the Kishu Ken may not be as prone to joint deformities as its sibling breeds, where the majority of tested Kishu Ken have been evaluated as having deformity-free hip joints. Elbows have, thus far, had the least favorable evaluations in the Kishu Ken, and elbow dysplasia may be something to screen for in Kishu Ken as more breed-specific data becomes available.Instead of physical deformities that cause health issues, Kishu Ken appear to be prone to allergies and autoimmune illnesses or skin conditions. These are not typically life-threatening, but can require lifelong treatment through regulated diet, environmental awareness, allergy medication, or even steroids depending on the individual. In an informal, owner-reported survey of purebred Kishu Ken, environmental allergies appear the most common health condition. Allergies to grass and dust mites have had particular mention. Autoimmune conditions vary, but a handful of individuals have an allergy-like immune response that causes sores and dermatitis which often responds to and is treated with common steroids. Addison's Disease is also noted in the breed, which is a autoimmune condition that causes an error in hormone production in the adrenal glands. Hypothyroidism is also sometimes observed. In dogs, the most common form of hypothyroidism in dogs is caused by an autoimmune condition, and the Kishu may be at particular risk due to the overall autoimmune condition in the breed.\nEyes are another moderate concern in Kishu Ken. The most common deformity of the eye is known as Persistent Pupillary Membranes according to the Finnish health database. This may or may not cause vision impairment, and each dog must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by a simple eye test. This is not a life-threatening disease and typically requires no treatment. The other known issue is entropion, a genetic defect affecting the eye in which the eyelid turns inward and the lashes scratch the eyeball.  This is likely connected in part to the triangular shape of the eye in the Kishu Ken.  Entropion requires surgery to prevent the loss of vision in the eye and continual pain to the dog.\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\nThe Kishu may be brushed to keep their fur clean and free from impacted undercoat, but their stiff topcoat should shed dirt very easily, even when wet and muddy. Bathe them as necessary, depending on owner preference. Their ears should be checked routinely for wax build up, infection or dirt. Their nails should also be trimmed regularly. Kishu Kens shed once or twice a year, making grooming at these times needed.\n\n\n=== Exercise ===\nThe Kishu needs adequate space to roam and exercise, meaning a house with a yard or urban environment with a fence. They need regular exercise on a leash, taking walks or runs. They can also be given a job to do such as hunting to satisfy their exercise.\n\n\n=== Competition ===\nKishu Ken do well in any venue that requires a strong bond with their owner and utilizes their natural drive to work and hunt. These venues may include lure coursing, barn hunt, obedience, rally, and agility competitions due to their intelligence and strong athleticism.   \n\n\n== History ==\nThe Kishu is a Foundation Stock breed with the American Kennel Club. The American Kishu Registry is the listed club contact in the United States by the AKC, though no official AKC breed club may be listed until the breed moves from FSS into Miscellaneous class.  Other registries include Japan Kennel Club (JKC) and Nihonken Hozonkai (NIPPO), both in Japan. The Nihon Ken Hozonkai is considered the main registry of the breed in its parent country and is responsible for the original breed standard. The Kishu has been recognized as a natural monument of Japan since 1934. Since the breed is so rare in North America and Europe, one might only ever see it in its native homeland, Japan. Even in Japan, the Kishu's numbers are in rapid decline, and without dedicated enthusiasts, the breed may soon disappear.Kishu Ken are a primitive dog that was selectively bred for the hunting of wild boar and deer in the mountainous Mie prefecture and Wakayama prefecture. The Kishu Ken were identified in a study in the 1930s carried out by a Japanese breeder, Haruo Isogai, which classified all native Japanese dog breeds into three categories: large-, medium-, and small-sized. The Kishu Ken belongs the medium-sized dog group.. The breed was not standardized until 1934 and was composed of the dogs collected from that area. When the breed first started, approximately 70% of individuals were said to be non-white. However, white is now the predominant color. The popularity of a primarily white line of Kishu Ken spread the gene responsible for white through the genepool and turned the Kishu Ken into the mostly-white breed it is today.. \nThe Kishu has, historically, had a strong association with the Honshu Wolf. One legend from the Kii peninsula states that the first boar dog, and the progenitor to the Kishu breed, was a wolf pup gifted to a hunter when he showed compassion for an injured she-wolf. This tale varies based on the telling, but the impact of this story on the Kishu breed persists today: many dogs are still named for the wolf from whence they came.\n\n\n== Manga ==\nThe works of manga artist Yoshihiro Takahashi feature many Kishu, characterizing them as skilled fighters.\n\nAkame of Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin\nKy\u014dshir\u014d of Ginga Legend Weed.

The Komondor was brought to Europe by the Cumans and the oldest known mention of it is in a Hungarian codex from 1544. The Komondor breed has been declared one of Hungary\u2019s national treasures, to be preserved and protected from modification.\n\n\n== Etymology and history ==\nKomondorok were brought to Hungary by Cumans, the Turkic speaking, nomadic people who settled in Hungary during the 12th and 13th century. The name Komondor derives from Koman-dor, meaning \"Cuman dog\".  The breed descends from Tibetan dogs and came from Asia with the Cumans, whose homeland might have been near the Yellow River. In the late 10th century, Mongols began to expand their territories at the expense of the Cumans, forcing them to move westwards. Fleeing from the Mongols, they reached the borders of Hungary in the 12th centuries. Cumans were granted asylum and settled in Hungary in 1239 under K\u00f6ten Khan. Komondor remains have been found in Cuman gravesites.\nThe name \"quman-dur\" means \"belonging to the Cumans\" or \"the dog of the Cumans\", thus distinguishing it from a similar Hungarian sheepdog breed which later merged with the Komondor. The name Komondor is found for the first time written in 1544 in the History of King Astiagis by K\u00e1konyi P\u00e9ter, in Hungarian. Later, in 1673, Amos Comenius mentions the Komondor in one of his works. \nToday, the Komondor is a fairly common breed in Hungary, its country of origin. Many Komondors were killed during World War II and local stories say that this was because when the Germans (and then the Russians) invaded, they had to kill the dog before they could capture a farm or house that it guarded.\n\nThe Komondor is related to the South Russian Ovcharka, the Puli and, by extension, the Pumi, the Mudi, the Polish Lowland Sheepdog, the Schapendoes, the Bearded collie, and the Old English sheepdog. In 1947, the Komondor was used to acquire fresh blood in the rare South Russian Ovcharka. In the 1970s, another Komondor cross was made. It is also believed to be related to the Briard, the Catalonian Sheepdog, the C\u00e3o da Serra de Aires, the Pyrenean Shepherd and the Bergamasco shepherd, but the Bergamasco has flocks unlike the Komondor.The two Hungarian breeds of livestock guardian dogs have evolved independently. This is because the Komondor was developed by a race of people who called it the Kuman-dor, the dog of the Cumans, and the Kuvasz was bred by a different people - the Magyars. For much of Hungary's early history, these two peoples lived in separate areas in Hungary, spoke different languages and so did not mix. As a result, their dogs have little, if any at all, admixture.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Komondor is a large molosser dog\u2014many are over 30 inches tall\u2014one of the larger breeds of dog. The body is covered with a heavy, matted, corded coat. They have robust bodies, strongly muscled with long legs and a short back. The tail is carried with a slight curl. The body when seen sideways, forms a prone rectangle. The length of body is slightly longer than the height at the withers, approximately 104% of the height at withers. The Komondor has a broad head with the muzzle slightly shorter than half of the length of the head with an even and complete scissor bite. Nose and lips are always black.The minimum height of female Komondors is 25.5 inches (65 cm) at the withers, with an average height of 27.5 inches (70 cm). The minimum height of male Komondors is 27.5 inches (70 cm) with an average height of 31.5 inches (80 cm). No upper height limit is given. Komondor females on average weigh between 88\u2013110 lb (40\u201350 kg) and Komondor males weigh on average between 110\u2013132 lb (50\u201360 kg).\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Komondor's coat is long, thick, and strikingly corded white coat, about 20 \u2013 27 cm long (the heaviest amount of fur in the canine world), which resembles dreadlocks or a mop. The puppy coat is soft and fluffy. However, the coat is wavy and tends to curl as the puppy matures. A fully mature coat is formed naturally from the soft undercoat and the coarser outer coat combining to form tassels or cords and will take about two years to form. Some help is needed in separating the cords so the dog does not turn into one large matted mess. The length of the cords increases with time as the coat grows. Moulting is minimal with this breed, contrary to what one might think (once cords are fully formed). The only substantial shedding occurs as a puppy before the dreadlocks fully form. The Komondor is born with only a white coat, unlike the similar-looking Puli, which can be white, black, or sometimes grayish. However, a working Komondor's coat may be discolored by the elements and may appear off-white if not washed regularly. Traditionally, the coat protects the Komondor from possible wolves' bites as the bites would not penetrate the thick coat.  The coat of the Komondor takes about two and a half days to dry after a bath.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Komondor is built for livestock guarding. Its temperament is like that of most livestock guarding dogs; it is calm and steady when things are normal, but, in case of trouble, the dog will fearlessly defend its charges. It was bred to think and act independently and make decisions on its own.The Komondor is affectionate with its family, and gentle with the children and friends of the family. Although wary of strangers, they can accept them when it is clear that no harm is imminent, being instinctively very protective of its family, home, and possessions. The Komondor is very good with other family pets, often very protective over them, but is intolerant to trespassing animals and is not a good dog for an apartment. The dog is vigilant and will rest in the daytime, keeping an eye on its surroundings, but at night is constantly moving, patrolling the place, moving up and down around its whole territory. The dogs will usually knock down intruders and keep them down until its owner arrives. Hungarian Komondor breeders used to say that an intruder may be allowed to enter the property guarded by a Komondor, but he will not be allowed to leave or escape.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nThe breed has a natural guardian instinct and an inherent ability to guard livestock. An athletic dog, the Komondor is fast and powerful and will leap at a predator to drive it off or knock it down. It can be used successfully to guard sheep against wolves or bears. It is a big, strong dog breed, armored with a thick coat. The coat provides protection against wild animals, weather and vegetation.  The coat looks similar to that of a sheep so it can easily blend into a flock and camouflage itself giving it an advantage when predators such as wolves attack. The Komondor is one breed of livestock guardian dog which has seen a vast increase in use as a guardian of sheep and goats in the United States to protect against predators such as coyotes, cougars, bears, and other predators.\n\n\n== Training ==\nDue to the Komondor's size, power, speed and temperament, a lack of obedience training can result in danger to others.  Komondors generally take well to training if started early (ideally between 4\u20138 months). A Komondor can become obstinate when bored, so it is imperative that training sessions be upbeat and happy. Praise is a must, as are consistent and humane corrections. Once a Komondor gets away with unfriendly or hostile behavior, it will always think such behavior is appropriate. Therefore, consistent corrections even with a young puppy are necessary to ensure a well-adjusted adult. Socialization is also extremely important. The Komondor should be exposed to new situations, people and other dogs while still a puppy. Because it is a natural guard dog, a Komondor that is not properly socialized may react in an excessively aggressive manner when confronted with a new situation or person.\nGiven the proper environment and care, a Komondor is a responsible, loving dog. It is devoted and calm without being sluggish. As in any breed, there is quite a range of personalities, so your needs should be outlined clearly to your breeder. An experienced breeder can try to identify that personality which would be happiest as an independent livestock dog, or that which wants more to please and would make a good obedience dog or family pet. Adolescence can be marked by changes in a Komondor's temperament, eating habits, trainability, and general attitude.\nBreed-specific legislation requires some breeds to be muzzled in public places. Romania is the only country that requires Komondors to be muzzled.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKomondor at Curlie"}, {"id": 285, "name": "Kooikerhondje", "country": "Netherlands", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog285", "description": "The Kooikerhondje (Old Dutch for \"small cager dog\" or \"small caging dog\") is a small spaniel-type breed of dog of Dutch ancestry that was originally used as a working dog, particularly in an eendenkooi (duck cage) to lure ducks.    Kooikers were popular in the 17th and 18th century and appeared in the paintings of Rembrandt and Jan Steen. The breed is rapidly gaining popularity in the United States, Canada and Scandinavia, where it is still relatively unknown.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Kooikerhondje is a small, flashy, orange and white spaniel-like sporting dog.  Originally bred in The Netherlands as a duck decoy dog, its heavily white plumed tail waves jauntily to entice and lure ducks to follow it into Eendenkooi (elaborate manmade pond trapping systems).  When not working the traps, Kooikers were expected to work on the farm to catch vermin.\nThe preferred height at the withers is 14.5 to 17.5 inches for males and 13.5 to 16.5 inches for females.  The proportion of the Kooiker is off-square.  The bone and substance of the Kooiker is moderate.  The head should be in proportion to the dog.  The expression is gentle and alert.  Ears should be orange-red in color and well feathered and ideally adorned with earrings.  The color for the Kooiker should preferably be distinct patches of clear orange-red on pure white although a few small spots on the legs are acceptable.  Color should be predominate on the back with the chest, belly, blaze and the majority of the legs and tail white. Black ear   A black tail ring where the color changes from orange-red to white is permitted.  A dog who is solid red on the back is acceptable but not preferred.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nCheerful, good natured, friendly, quiet, well-behaved, and alert; those are terms that are used to describe the Kooikerhondje. Depending on its domestic environment, it is kind, happy and lively. They are also intelligent, attentive and more than willing to please their owner. The Kooikerhondje adapts to situations rather quickly, changing his behavior from quiet to lively when the situation allows him to be. He will not always immediately like strangers, instead choosing to retreat. But once he warms up to someone, the trust will be there for the rest of his life.\nThe Kooikerhondje can make a fine apartment dog if exercised regularly, but a fenced yard will be more ideal. He has a medium energy level, yet is usually quiet when indoors.  Kooikerhondje can be reactive with strange dogs and are wary of boisterous children, in general.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nKooikers have good appetites and a tendency to put on weight easily. Their life span is 12\u201314 years. As Kooikerhondjes have a small genetic base, hereditary diseases were somewhat prevalent earlier. These include:\n\nvon Willebrand's disease, a blood clotting disorder\nCataract and other eye diseases\nPatellar luxation\nHereditary Necrotising Myelopathy (ENM) a fatal neurologic disease\nPolymyositis\nKidney disordersToday (due to a lot of hard work in the national clubs) most Kooikers used for breeding are free from von Willebrands disease (most national clubs require both male and female dogs to be free from this disease to be allowed to breed).\nPatellar luxation is not a major problem in most countries at the moment, but is kept under a close watch to prevent it from becoming a problem again. In the Netherlands, eye tests are available and all breeders breeding according to the breed club's rules have to test their dogs. Only dogs that are free of eye diseases are allowed to be used for breeding. Testing for ENM became available in  2012. In the Netherlands, only dogs who are tested may be used for breeding. Only allowed breedings are Free x Free or Free X Carrier. Carrier to Carrier should never be done as the risk of this fatal disease is high. Puppy purchasers should inquire about the ENM status of the parents.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Kooikerhondje was developed in the Netherlands sometime prior to the sixteenth century to be a breed to lure ducks into traps - a technique also called tolling. They were used to lure  'kooien' (cages in the form of canals with traps at the ends), where the hunter (the so-called Kooiker) could easily catch the fowl. The dogs that were used by the Kooiker for this kind of hunting technique, were referred to as the 'Kooiker's hondjes' (literally: Kooiker's dogs). Eventually this led to this dog being called Kooikerhondje.\nThe breed almost became extinct during World War II until Baroness van Hardenbroek van Ammerstol rescued it. The breed was only officially recognized by the Raad van Beheer, the Dutch Kennel Club, in 1971 and has since been imported into other countries and recognised officially. The breed is still relatively unknown in North America and not yet recognized as a breed in Canada, although it was accepted into the AKC's FSS program, in 2004.  The breed was moved to the AKC Miscellaneous class on July 1, 2015 in preparation to moving to the Sporting Group upon full recognition. As of Jan 1, 2018, the Nederlnadse Kooikerhondje has been fully recognized by the American Kennel Club and is now competing in the Sporting Group.  In the United States, both the UKC and ARBA recognize the breed.\nIn the UK, the breed has been removed from the import list and is now eligible to enter Crufts for the Best in Show award, despite there being only 76 of the breed in the UK.\nIn January 2013, the Kennel Club announced it was re-classifying the Kooikerhondje from the gundog group to the utility group effective from January 2014. The decision was reached after discussions with the UK breed clubs and unanimous agreement was achieved.Some historians believe the Kooikerhondje may have possibly played a part in the development of the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKooikerhondje at Curlie"}, {"id": 286, "name": "Koolie", "country": "Australia", "type": "", "picture": "dog286", "description": "The Koolie (also known as the Australian Koolie or by the misnomer German Coolie) is an Australian dog breed. The Koolie is a working or herding dog which has existed in Australia since the early 19th century when it was bred from imported British working dogs. Robert Kaleski, in an article on Cattle Dogs in the August 1903 issue of the Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales, describes the \"Welsh heeler or merle, erroneously known as the German collie,\" as a \"blue-gray dog about the size and build of a smooth-haired collie, generally with wall eyes.\"  The British background predominated in the dogs that came to be associated with the \"German collie\" name.\nThere is substantial variation in the Koolie population, as Koolies were bred to exhibit different characteristics in different regions. The Koolie Club of Australia defines the breed based on its ability to work rather than on its conformation. However, most Koolie breeders refer to the Koolie as a breed rather than as a type, and assert that it \"breeds true\", with various types or strains.\nThe Koolie is a 'heading dog', one which has a natural instinct to cast out (i.e., circle widely), round sheep and bring them back to their owner. Koolies are known as silent, upright, working dogs. They are used for \"heading\" sheep and also for quiet careful work at close quarters at lambing time or for \"shedding\" (cutting out) sheep.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Koolie is as diverse as the country it originates from, Australia. In the north of Queensland and New South Wales they are tall, medium boned and agile, bred for mustering Simmental cattle and Brahma over many miles.\nIn The Hunter Valley region and Snowy Mountains of New South Wales, they're thicker set and shorter to flush low lying cattle from the dense bush and gullies. In Victoria, one finds the smallest variety of the Koolie. Koolies are bred to meet the needs of the stockman, grazier and farmer, all agile, all with the same ability to adapt to any situation, all with a strong willingness drive. The Koolie vary from 40 to 60 centimetres (16 to 24 in) in size and are a contrast of coat, colour and body type, although they are merled coat pattern. The solid red or black Koolie are often mistaken for Kelpies, and some bi coloured Koolie have been taken for Border Collies by the general public, rarely if ever by breeders. As all of these breeds share Collie ancestry, they resemble each other.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\n\nThe Koolie coat ranges from short/smooth (like that of the original blue merle Collies from Scotland), short (like a working Kelpie), medium and, not common, long (like the show Border Collie). Koolies are typically slightly longer than tall. The majority of owners prefer the short/smooth coats as they do not pick up grass seed, and are very easy to maintain, with the occasional swim to keep the coat glossy and free of parasites.\n\n\n=== Colouring ===\nKoolie colours can be solid (all one colour black or red/chocolate (this includes Koolie who are cryptic merle: carry the merle gene but do not display it obviously)) \"bi\" (black & white or red & white) \"tri\" (solid red or black, with white markings, normally with brown points), or \"tri merle\" (same description but merle) \"merle\" (grey, black, red/chocolate or white undercoat with large splashes of darker colourings of red/chocolate for red merles or black/grey for blue merles). Black Koolies will commonly have a black nose with black eyes, or tones of black including blue. Red or chocolate Koolies will commonly have a red or chocolate nose with brown eyes, or tones of brown, including yellow, and there can be combinations of both black or brown with the added blue eye/s.\nThere are also dilute colours of slate or gun metal grey for black Koolies and fawn for Red Koolies.\nAlso there is a yellow or cream colour created by the E,loci which is a masking gene and covers a red/chocolate Koolie to make it appear yellow/cream, this gene will also cover any merle, so it is advised that great care be taken and DNA testing done to discover if the E,loci is present before breeding.\nThe same advice is given with relations to the dilute gene.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nGraziers, stockmen and dairy farmers across Australia since days long past have typically selected breeds which display the abilities required to meet their working needs. The temperament found in a Koolie is a culmination of these much sought-after abilities. The optimal worker possesses a combination of working skills and bonding temperament.\nThere are times when an uninitiated dog owner or a new enthusiast mistakes the Koolie as a shy, reserved or even a timid animal. The Koolie's temperament needs to be understood in proper context when one seeks an optimal match of skills and demeanour. Koolies are intelligent animals, and the most experienced handlers know well that they need guidance in training. A steady and supportive approach will be productive, proving the Koolie's adaptability in diverse situations when given time.\nOwners will be rewarded through the Koolie's diligence in varied roles such as in work situations, sporting activities, loyal service or the time honoured role of companionship. Known to be patient, temperate, dedicated, with a strong sense of willingness and devotion; the Koolie is not naturally aggressive but can demonstrate dominance. They show an untiring enthusiasm for work and an admirable hardiness when the job or circumstance requires.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThe median longevity of Koolies is about 18 years, which is a typical lifespan for this breed. Koolies have a diverse gene pool and so do not suffer from the many genetic problems found in recognised breeds, but the merle for which the Koolie is most recognised by can, and does, produce blind and/or deaf white pups. It is highly recommended that, when considering breeding, matings of merle to solid are the safest option.\n\n\n=== Medical research ===\nIn 2003 DNA testing carried out on 56 individual Koolie bloodlines from Australia by Dr. Mark Neff of the University of California at Davis in the USA cleared those bloodlines tested for the presence of the mutant gene mdr1-1, which causes malfunction in the canine multidrug resistance gene; Collie bloodlines were chosen to be tested because they showed a reaction, even death, to chemicals, such as Ivermectin, used in the treatment of intestinal parasites.\nIn 2004, the Koolie Club of Australia in conjunction with Genetic Science Service of Australia launched the collection and processing of Koolie DNA, which continues to test for all current Collie diseases and family relationships. To date, the Koolie Club of Australia's database records show that their registered Koolie breed is relatively free of common genetic disorders that are found in recognised pure breeds, thanks to DNA testing. It is generally accepted that this is due to the natural breeding selection, which has continued unhindered for over 160 years.\nIn 2007, the Koolie Club of Australia through Genetic Science Service of Australia gained access to the Merle test, discovered in 2006 by Dr. Keith Murphy's laboratory of the Department of Pathobiology at the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences of Texas A&M University more info\nIn 2008, Koolies registered with the Koolie Club of Australia have undertaken a breed specificity test to identify the Koolie genetically, the results will help discover and create stronger bloodlines.\nIn 2010, the Australian Koolie's own unique signature gene is discovered through ASAP laboratories in Victoria, Australia, by Dr. George Sofronidis, making them the first Australian breed recognised by their DNA before the controlling canine body of their home country.\nIn 2012, the Australian Koolie breed became a recognised member of the Veterinaries Genetics Assurance program.\n\n\n== Herding technique ==\n\nKoolies are much sought-after in rural Australia, and interest is now being shown in America, Canada, Germany, Finland, New Zealand, Switzerland and Holland. According to Geoff Broughton, past president of the Koolie Club of Australia for 7 years, the Koolie will head (move to the front or head of the stock to push them back towards you), heel or drive, (push the stock from behind), cast (move out and around the stock), block (hold the stock or block them from in front, in three sheep trials this action is called the pick up) and back (literally jump onto the backs of their charges to herd them if necessary). Koolies have a reputation for being upright workers with a good eye, who can easily shift their focus from holding the group to casting around a flock or gathering breakaways. They are not known for having \"sticky eyes\" (focusing on the sheep in front only). Unlike other working breeds, which are noted for their crouched form or style and preference for either yard or field work, Koolies are at ease working in closed surroundings such as yards or trucks and being out in paddocks and droving. As well as working anything from ducks to bulls, like all dogs of their kind they will herd family members and children in the absence of other charges.\nHerding instincts and trainability can be measured at non-competitive herding tests. Koolies exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in stock dog trials.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Koolie's ancestors were the smooth coated blue merle Collie (imported from Britain in the 19th century) and the Black and Tan Collie from the Highlands of Scotland; these were the same type imported by Thomas Hall for the creation of his Heelers. The Koolie is believed to be descended from the same Collie types that were brought to Australia for the kennels of Thomas S. Hall (an originator of the Australian Cattle Dog breed); some believe that they could be direct descendants of Hall's dogs. While some believe the 'German Coolie' to be descended from the 'German Tiger', a European herding dog, there is no genetic or even anecdotal evidence to support this claim. A more plausible theory is that these dogs were used by German immigrants in South Australia who, unable to correctly pronounce 'collie', referred to the dogs as 'coolies'. Others have noted strong similarities with the Australian Koolie and the Welsh Collie, another British herding subtype.\nAccording to older Koolie breeders personal records, from diaries and photo albums the Koolie has been around for over 160 years. During the industrial era some bloodlines were influenced by Kelpie and Border Collie, as explained by one grazier in Western Australia, \"You bred from the good workers which were around and Koolies were not always to be found, so you bred to the next best worker that was and this was either the Kelpie or Border depending on the region you lived and the stock you worked\".\nIn 2000, the Koolie Club of Australia was formed to preserve, protect and ethically promote the Koolie breed. The Koolie Club does not actively work towards bench standard recognition, feeling this would only be detrimental to the breeds working future. As of (2013), no bench standard exists.\nIn 2004, the Koolie breed was recognised by the Australian Sporting Registrar, judges from the Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) may judge Koolies in all ANKC sanctioned sporting trials. In the states of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, registered Koolies may compete in, herding, obedience, tracking, jumping, gambles and dog agility events through registration on their State's Sporting Register as members of the Koolie Club of Australia.\n\nIn May 2006, the Stockdog Committee of the Australian Shepherd Club of America voted to accept the \"Koolie/German Coolie\" into their list of recognised and accepted herding breeds, admission was granted June 2006.\nIn 2006, The American Herding Breed Association accepted the Australian Koolie onto their list of recognised and accepted breeds.\n\n\n=== Exports ===\nIn 2002, the first exportation to America of a registered DNA tested Koolie were orchestrated by members of the Koolie Club of Australia, for Ms Torry Lynn Revels of North Carolina, USA.\nIn 2003, at the Koolie Club of Australia's Annual General meeting a unanimous vote was returned to appoint Ms Revels the clubs official representative in America, Ms Revels was instrumental in gaining acceptance of the Australian Koolie to the recognised breeds lists of the American Herding Breed Association and the Australian Shepherd Club of America in order to gain qualifying scores in herding trials.\nIn 2008, the first exportation to New Zealand of a registered DNA tested Koolie were orchestrated by members of the Koolie Club of Australia, for Ms Penny Nalders of Wellington, New Zealand.\nIn 2008, the first exportation to Finland of registered DNA tested Koolies were orchestrated by members of the Koolie Club of Australia, for Ms Sinikka Kumpusalmi of Vehmersalmi, and Mrs Satu Tasanen of Honkilahti, Finland.\nIn 2011, the first exportation to Switzerland of registered DNA tested Koolies were orchestrated by members of the Koolie Club of Australia, for Ms Brigitt Stirnimann of Aarwangen, Switzerland.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBob the Railway Dog\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nAleta Curry (2003). \"The All-Australian Dog: The Koolie\", one of a series of articles appearing in The Southern Village View Magazine, \u00a9 2003.\nKoolie Club of Australia (2003). \" The Reemerging Breed\", one of a series of articles appearing in Dogs Life Magazine, \u00a9 2003\nChris Howe (1996) \"The Origin of the German Koolie\" one of a series of articles appearing in The Working Stock Dog Magazine of Australia \u00a9 1996\nAustralian Shepherd Club of America: Admissions of Koolie/German Coolie breed of Australia effective 1 June (2006) located on page 37 of ASCA Rules and regulations\nLinda Rorem, (1997) \"Collie Family Tree\" first published 1997 \u00a9 Linda Rorem\nCarol Ann & Ernest Hartnagle \"The Total Australian Shepherd: Beyond the Beginning\" \u00a9 2007\nJeanne Joy Hartnagle \"All About Aussies\" \u00a9 1985, 1996, 2005\nThe Merle Gene (2006)- Department of Pathobiology at the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences of Texas A&M University \u00a9 2006\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHartnagle-Taylor, Jeanne Joy; Taylor, Ty (2010).

Koyun dogs are present in Ordu Province to the west of Rize in Turkey. This breed is also called Bayburt Kelpi locally.\nThe dog appears in various colours but dark grey is the most common. Bi-coloured animals occur. Rize Koyun dogs have a solid body structure and strong legs which make for easy traveling of the hilly areas of the Canik Mountains where they are found. The tail is normally in a downward position but is raised when the dog is alert. Shoulder heights of males are about 70 centimetres (28 in) and those of females about 1\u20132 cm lower.\nThe Rize Koyun is not a pet. In addition to guardian duties, it assists its human owners in giving vociferous or physical warning of intruding people or animals.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 288, "name": "Korean Jindo", "country": "South Korea", "type": "Northern Breed", "picture": "dog288", "description": "The Korean Jindo (\uc9c4\ub3d7\uac1c) is a breed of hunting dog that originated on Jindo Island in South Korea. Brought to the United States with South Korean immigrants, it is celebrated in its native land for its fierce loyalty and brave nature. The Jindo breed became recognized by the United Kennel Club on January 1, 1998 and by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 2005.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nJindos are double-coated spitz-type dogs. The Jindo Gae is the National Breed of Korea. Distinguishing the Jindo breed from mixes and other breeds is often done by close examination of cranial and facial features and by analyzing the proportion of the head to the body. In addition, the breed exhibits sexual dimorphism with females having more angular heads than males. The keen and alert appearance of the Jindo gives the impression of intelligence, strength, and agility. Other features include forward-pointing upright ears and a double coat.\n\n\n==== Body ====\nKorean Jindo owners have traditionally divided Jindos into two body types:\n\nTonggol or Gyupgae: This type is more muscular and stocky with the Korean National Dog Association (KNDA) recognizing an equal proportion of height at the withers to length (10:10). The depth of chest is approximately equal to one-half the height at the withers. The loin is also typically shorter.\nHudu or Heutgae: This type is more slender with a somewhat less depth of chest and a slightly longer loin. Moreover, other physical features tend to have an increased length, such as the ears, muzzle, and head. This results in an appearance that is longer than tall with the KNDA recommending a height at the withers to length ratio of 10:11.The KNDA also recognizes a third body type called Gakgol which is a gradually emerging combination of the two traditional types, retaining the length of body of the Hudu and the depth of chest of the Tonggol.\nIn regards to the Jindo's body appearance, the United Kennel Club currently states, \"The squarely built Jindo has a chest that is moderately deep but not too broad. At its deepest point the chest reaches to, or just above, the elbow. The brisket is well developed and the ribs are well sprung. The back is strong and straight and the loin is well muscled, taut, lean and narrower than the ribcage. There is considerable tuck up.\"\n\n\n==== Color ====\nJindos come in five colors:\n\nWhite (baekgu)-This color is actually an off-white or ivory shade with tan or light brown around the tips of the ears, the back of the hind legs, and the tip of the tail. Some whites may have a subtle tan stripe running from the head, down the top line, to the tail.\nFawn (hwanggu)-The color of well-ripened wheat.\nGrey-This coat looks gray from a distance but is actually made up of individual white, black, and fawn colored hairs.\nBlack and tan (heukgu)-Black head and upper body with tan on the muzzle, belly, and paws, and an eye-shaped tan spot over each eye.\nBrindle-Also known as \"Tiger\" pattern. Thin, dark brown or black stripes like a tiger's on a fawn base. These stripes appear at an early age.Some Jindo Island residents value black, black/red, and red/white Jindos as good hunters. The United Kennel Club recognizes six different coat colors: white, red fawn, wolf grey, black, black and tan, and brindle (tiger pattern).\n\n\n=== Feet ===\nThe feet are of medium size, round in shape, with thick, strong tan pads. Nails are hard and may be black, cream or gray.\n\n\n=== Gait ===\nThe Jindo moves with strides of moderate length.\nIt is a quick, light, elastic trot which enables the Jindo to travel quickly over any terrain.\nThe forelegs and hind legs are carried straight forward, with neither elbows nor stifles turned in or out.\nAt a normal walking speed, the Jindo tends to lower its head.\n\n\n==== Head ====\nThe top skull of an adult dog should be broad and rounded between the ears and free from wrinkles.\nThe under jaw is well-developed and helps give a round or octagonal shape to the head when viewed from the front.  Coarse hairs stand away from the cheeks.\nThe ears are triangular and upright (leaning forward past vertical). The inside of the ears should be well-furred.  Ears on puppies normally lie flat until they are past 5\u20136 months.\nThe eyes are almond/round.  They should be a shade of brown (a dark reddish-brown being preferred).  Some dogs have light brown eyes but this color is not desirable.  Jindos should not have blue eyes.\nThe nose should be black on non-white dogs.  White dogs may have mottled portions of tan or pink in the center of the nose.\nThe muzzle is well proportioned without being bulky.  The lips should be taut and black.  The preferred color for the tongue is solid pink.\nThe Jindo has a complete set of evenly spaced, white teeth with a scissors bite.\nTypically, males have larger heads and females have more fox-like features.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe Korean Jindo Dog is well known for its unwavering loyalty and gentle nature. They are of medium to high energy. They make great house dogs as long as they are given good mental and physical stimulation (i.e. plenty of on-leash walks), however they are not typically suited to dog park environments. Jindo dogs need reasonable space to roam and run but this can be accommodated through consistent walks. Jindos require a lot of care and attention. If kept in a yard, the fencing must be at least 6 feet high due to their strong hind legs that enable them to jump high.\nBecause the Jindo is an active and intelligent dog, it requires frequent interaction with people or another dog in the family.  For some the Jindo may even be too intelligent, for it will commonly think for itself.  The same intelligence that allows the dog to learn commands and tricks very quickly can be a bit too much to handle. If left alone for a long stretch, it finds its own entertainment.  A young Jindo may attempt to climb over a fence or wall, even by way of a tree or digging under, or remodel the house if confined indoors.\n\nJindos serve as excellent watchdogs, able to distinguish family from foe, friends from strangers. The Korean Army is known to use Jindos as guard dogs at major bases.  Because Jindos rarely bark aggressively, especially in familiar environments, an owner may lend special credence to the warning of his/her pet. Many Jindos do not take any food from anyone other than their owners. Many Koreans consider Jindo Dogs as 'gatekeepers', loosely tied up near the front gate of the house in rural areas.\nSome Jindos display a curious aversion from running water and avoid situations that might get them wet. They let themselves be washed, although with great reluctance. Some may even be afraid of going out in the rain. Many Jindos would not want to cross a bridge over running water.\nPeople adopt Jindo dogs because of their beautiful appearance, high intelligence, loyalty, and sometimes for their fighting spirit, then quickly realize that raising a Jindo dog to be a well-behaved member of the family takes a lot of effort and time. This characteristic may come from the background that Koreans traditionally kept their pet dogs outside their houses.\n\n\n=== Height and weight ===\nDesirable height at maturity, measured at the withers, ranges from 19\u00bd to 21 inches (or 48 to 53 cm) for males and 18\u00bd to 20 inches (or 45 to 50 cm) for females.Weight should be in proportion to the height, giving a well-muscled, lean appearance without being too light or too heavy. The typical weight range for a male Jindo in good condition is 40 to 60 pounds (18 to 27 kg); for a female, 35 to 55 pounds (16 to 25 kg).\n\n\n=== Tail ===\nThe tail is thick and strong and set on at the end of the top line. The tail should be at least long enough to reach to the hock joint. The tail may be loosely curled over the back or carried over the back in a sickle position. The hair on the underside of the tail is thick, stiff, abundant, and twice as long as the coat on the shoulders, which causes the hair to fan outward when the tail is up.\n\n\n== History ==\nThere is no written record of the origin of the Korean Jindo Dog. Authorities agree that the Jindos originated and existed on Jindo Island for a long time.   There have been many theories regarding the origin of Jindo Dog. One of the theories describes Jindo as cross-breeds with Mongolian dogs when Mongol forces invaded Korea around the 13th century.They are now protected under the Cultural Properties Protection Act.In 1962, the Government of South Korea designated the Jindo as the 53rd 'Natural Treasure' (or translated as 'Natural Monument') (\ucc9c\uc5f0\uae30\ub150\ubb3c; \u5929\u7136\u8a18\u5ff5\u7269) and passed the Jindo Preservation Ordinance. Because of the special status of the Jindo, it is very difficult to export purebred Jindo outside of Korea. Jindos marched in the opening ceremonies of the 1988 Summer Olympic Games in Seoul, Korea. The United Kennel Club recognized the Jindo on January 1, 1998.\nThe Jindo Dogs Guild of Korea (Korean: \ud55c\uad6d \uc9c4\ub3d7\uac1c \uc870\ud569), as of 2008, issues certificates of pure Korean Jindo Dog, which specifies the registered number of the mother, sex, and birth date of the dog, as well as breeder's address and whether the dog is of purebred.The breed first appeared in the West in France and has since made its way over to the U.S. There are only two Jindos registered in the U.S., one in the Los Angeles area and one in Seattle. There are 25 registered in the United Kingdom. Also, the Korean government and Samsung have contributed to efforts to gain international recognition for the Jindo.\n\n\n=== Hunting ===\nThe Jindo are renowned for their outstanding hunting ability, due to their courage, cunning, and pack sensibility. Besides the usual prey of medium to large game, their hunting prowess is displayed in a legend of three Jindos that killed a Siberian tiger.\nThey have mainly been used as deer and boar hunters. There have been anecdotal reports of Korean owners being awakened by their Jindo one morning to be led deep into the forest to a deer the dog had taken down alone. There have also been reported cases in America of intruding coyotes being killed by Jindos defending their territory.In traditional Korean hunting without guns, a pack of well trained Jindos was extremely valuable. A master with a loyal pack could hunt without much trouble at all, for when the pack brings down a deer, boar or other target, one of them returns to the master to lead him to the prey, while the others stand guard against scavengers.\n\n\n=== As police and military dogs ===\nIn a 2009 interview with Korea Economic Daily (\ud55c\uad6d\uacbd\uc81c), Park Nam-sun (\ubc15\ub0a8\uc21c), an expert search dog handler in South Korea, testified that Jindo dogs are not fit as rescue dogs and search dogs. It is because Jindo dogs' hunting instincts are too strong (they can forget their mission because of their hunting instincts), and they usually give their loyalty only to the first owner, while handlers of search dogs and rescue dogs can frequently change.In 2010, Son Min-suk (\uc190\ubbfc\uc11d), a member of Korean Security Forum, wrote that most of Korean military dogs were German Shepherds, and that Jindo dogs were not fit for military dogs as they were highly likely to escape their duties to find their first handlers who might be discharged from military services, or to come back to their original home.However, efforts to train Jindo dogs as search and rescue dogs continue. In October 2010, the Los Angeles Police Department announced their intent to evaluate the Jindo dog breed for law enforcement service, specifically for patrol and detection service. Four selected Jindo puppies would be distributed to LAPD and Glendale California Police Department to be trained as K9 units. After a year of trying, the trainers found that the dogs did not have the right disposition for police work because they were too easily distracted and too eager to please their masters.\n\n\n=== Anecdotes on loyalty of Jindos ===\nIn 1993, a 7-year-old female Jindo named Baekgu (\ubc31\uad6c; \u767d\u72d7; translated as a White Dog), raised by Park Bok-dan (\ubc15\ubcf5\ub2e8), an 83-year-old woman on Jindo Island, was sold to a new owner in the city of Daejeon which is located about 300 km (180 mi) away from the island. The dog escaped her new home and returned to her original owner, Bak, after 7 months, haggard and exhausted.  Baekgu remained with her original owner, who decided to keep the loyal dog, until the dog died of natural causes 7 years later. The story was a national sensation in Korea and was made into cartoons, a TV documentary, and a children's storybook. In 2004, Jindo County erected a statue of Baekgu in her hometown to honor the dog.Another Jindo, also named Baekgu, a 4-year-old male at the time who lived alone with his owner Park Wan-suh (\ubc15\uc644\uc11c) residing on Jindo Island, did not eat anything and mourned for his dead owner for seven days after the owner died from a liver disease in June 2000. According to Chosun Ilbo, the dog accompanied his dead owner for three days until other people came to find the body, followed the owner to his funeral, and came back home, not eating anything for four days. The Korean Jindo Dog Research Institute (\uc9c4\ub3d7\uac1c \uc2dc\ud5d8\uc5f0\uad6c\uc18c) brought him under its care, but a person related to the Institute announced that the dog would not interact with anyone except for his feeder as of 2005.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of dogs noted for being faithful after their master's death\nDonggyeongi\nNureongi\nPungsan Dog\nSapsali\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKorean Jindo at Curlie"}, {"id": 289, "name": "Kromfohrl\u00e4nder", "country": "Germany", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog289", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 290, "name": "Kumaon Mastiff", "country": "India", "type": "", "picture": "dog290", "description": "The Kumaon Mastiff (Kumauni:  \u0938\u093f\u092a\u094d\u0930\u094b \u0915\u0941\u0915\u0941\u0930), also known as the Indian Mastiff and Bulli, is a rare Molosser-type working breed of dog originating in Uttarakhand state of India.

They have been trained as military assistant dogs to perform a variety of tasks such as detecting mines. Some are also trained to be fire dogs and rescue dogs. Today they are commonly kept as family companions by many pet owners in China.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nKunming wolfdogs are typically medium-sized dog who fall under the spitz type category. Their height is 25\u201327 inches (64\u201368 cm) and weight is 66\u201384 pounds (30\u201338 kg). The head and body of the Kunming wolfdogs are similar in appearance to the German Shepherd except they stand taller in the back. They have seasonal coats that grow into a double layered coat during the late fall to the early winter but will later on shed into a shorter coat during the late spring. The tail is long like their German Shepherd cousins. Kunming wolfdogs occasionally lift their tails curled high when excited but they often carry it lower behind their back like their wolf ancestors do. Coats are marked with a black saddle and muzzle, with other colors ranging from light straw to deep rust.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nKunming wolfdogs share similar behavioural traits to their German Shepherd ancestors. They are extremely intelligent, normally self-assured and are marked by their curiosity and willingness to learn which allows them to excel in task training. However, they are also highly active and require a lot of activities and ideally one long walk per day in order to keep them occupied. Like German Shepherds, Kunming wolfdogs are suitable to have around children when properly trained and supervised.\n\n\n== Breed history ==\nMost of the exact dog breeds used in the gene pool for the Kunming wolfdogs is ambiguous due to the lack of proper pedigrees and the fact that a majority of them were crossbreeds although the German Shepherd and some wolfdog crosses are known to play a huge part in the breed's origin. The Kunming wolfdog was created in the early 1950s to meet the need for military dogs in Yunnan. A group of ten shepherd type dogs mixed with unknown breeds were brought to Kunming from a military K9 training program in Beijing in 1953. These ten dogs were insufficient for the immediate need, and so fifty suitable household dogs from Kunming were recruited as well as forty similar dogs from the city of Guiyang in Guizhou province (like the first ten, the exact breeds of these dogs are unknown other than that they were crossbreeds). After training, the best twenty of these ninety dogs were then selected. Ten wolfdogs bred in Beijing, twenty 'civil dogs' plus an additional ten 'shepherd dogs' imported from East Germany were added to the pool from which the Kunming Dog was developed. The Chinese Public Security Bureau officially recognized the Kunming Dog as a breed in 1988. Kunming Dogs are used by the Chinese military and police, and have also found their way into use as civilian watchdogs and guard dogs.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWolf\nGerman Shepherd\nGuard dogs\nCanadian Eskimo Dog\nEstablished wolfdog breeds\nTamaskan dog\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 292, "name": "Kur\u012b", "country": "New Zealand", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog292", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 293, "name": "Kuvasz", "country": "Hungary", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog293", "description": "The Kuvasz (Hungarian pronunciation: [\u02c8kuv\u0252s]), is an ancient breed of livestock dog of  Hungarian origin.  Mention of the breed can be found in old Hungarian texts. It has historically been used as a royal guard dog, or to guard livestock, but has been increasingly found in homes as a pet over the last seventy years.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Kuvasz is a large dog with a dense, double, odorless coat which is white in color and can range from wavy to straight in texture. Although the fur is white, the Kuvasz\u2019s skin pigmentation should be dark and the nose should be black. The eyes should have an almond shape. Females usually weigh between 32\u201341 kg (70\u201390 pounds) while males weigh between 45\u201352 kg (100\u2013115 pounds) with a medium bone structure. The head should be half as wide as it is long with the eyes set slightly below the plane of the muzzle.  The stop (where the muzzle raises to the crown of the head) should be defined but not abrupt. The precise standard varies by country. (See the Breed Standards for a more precise description.) To a casual observer, the Kuvasz may appear similar to a Great Pyrenees, Akbash, a Maremma Sheepdog, Slovak Cuvac and the Polish Tatra Sheepdog, all of which are similar in size, coat color, and general appearance.\n\nAs with many livestock guardian dogs, the color of the Kuvasz's coat serves a functional purpose and is an essential breed criterion. Shepherds purposefully bred the Kuvasz to have a light colored coat so that it would be easier for the shepherds to distinguish the Kuvasz from wolves that would prey on the livestock during the night. The Komondor, a cousin of the Kuvasz, has a white coat for the same reason. Traditionally, the Hungarian Kuvasz's coat could be either white or cream colored with a wavy texture.  However, there is some debate, particularly in the United States, concerning the appropriateness of \"cream\" colored coats in show-quality dogs and whether the coat should be straight or wavy in texture. Since washing and brushing out a coat, as done for shows in the US also causes the coat to appear straight, the debate may be circular. Straighter coats may also have appeared as the result of breeding programs that developed after World War II, when the breeding lines in Hungary were isolated from the rest of the world as a result of Soviet & German occupation (see History, below). By Hungarian standard the straight coat is not acceptable. There must be special twirls in the coat.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Kuvasz is an intelligent dog and is often described as having a clownish sense of humor which can last throughout their adolescence and into adulthood. They are intensely loyal and patient pets who appreciate attention but may also be somewhat aloof or independent, as well as thoroughly cunning, particularly with strangers. They rank a low 42nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, but keep in mind that Coren's criteria focus on how fast a dog can learn obedience \"tricks\"\u2014a limited test of intelligence. \nThe Kuvasz breed is for experienced handlers only. The combination of intelligence, independence, and protectiveness make obedience training and socialization absolute necessities. They are strictly working dogs, bred for centuries to think independently and act without instruction, scanning and evaluating the environment and taking protective or deterrent action as needed. This was a vital trait in their solitary duties protecting livestock. That independence can make training a difficult task, wearing on the patience of even experienced owners. Kuvasz quickly understand what is being asked of them, but they have to respect a person as a trusted leader before they'll obey commands. They're also not usually interested in meaningless activity, such as doing entertaining tricks. As a result, they are not recommended for novices and those who do not have time to train and socialize them properly. An adolescent Kuvasz should be able to learn basic obedience commands and consistently respond to them; however the instinctive need to investigate strangers and protect its owner may cause the Kuvasz to act independently when off leash and ignore the calls of a handler. \nInteractions with other dogs, especially first meetings, should be managed carefully. One of the tasks of a livestock guardian is to kill wolves, coyotes, and other predators, and this instinct remains intact in the modern dog. Handlers should be alert to signs of tension, and intervene before a dangerous situation develops. However, a well socialized, well trained Kuvasz will usually ignore, play with, or go exploring with other dogs once a successful introduction has been made.\nA potential owner should refrain from purchasing a Kuvasz if barking will be a problem at the home. While not every Kuvasz is prone to barking (socializing them will define what is a threat), many of them fulfill their guardian role by vocally warning off potential threats, both real and imagined. On the other hand, many of these qualities make the Kuvasz excellent guardians for sheep or large estates. \nThe Kuvasz has a very special, close connection to his owner or family, as well as anyone in their circle, human or animal, that the dog considers part of the flock. He will protect all of them. He may also police interactions among them, such as discouraging rough play by herding rowdy individuals away from the group. The owner has the responsibility for setting clear, consistent limits on this behavior. \nThat connection can easily be lost if the dog is humiliated, confused by contradictory commands, or otherwise abused.\nThe only country is Romania, where a Breed-specific legislation specifies that Kuvasz must be muzzled when in public places.\n\n\n== History ==\nAround 2000 BC, the Magyar tribes moved along the recently established trade routes of the steppes, gradually leading them to the Carpathian Basin in Hungary which they conquered in 896 A.D. With them came Kuvasz-type dogs, which primarily served as livestock guardians. In 1978, the fossilized skeleton of a 9th Century Kuvasz-type dog was discovered in Fen\u00e9kpuszta near Keszthely, a discovery which was remarkable in that the morphology of the skeleton was almost identical to a modern Kuvasz. If accurate, such a discovery would mark the Kuvasz as among the oldest identifiable dog breeds as only a few breeds can be dated beyond the 9th Century.\nAfter the Magyar settlement of the Carpathian Basin, the tribes converted to a more agrarian lifestyle and began to devote more resources towards animal husbandry. Whereas the Komondor was used in the lower elevations with drier climates, the Kuvasz was used in the wet pastures of the higher mountains and both were an integral part of the economy. Later, during the 15th Century, the Kuvasz became a highly prized animal and could be found in the royal court of King Matthias Corvinus. Kuvasz puppies were given to visiting dignitaries as a royal gift, and the King was said to have trusted his dogs more than his own councilors. After the king's death, the popularity of the breed among the nobles waned but it was still frequently found in its traditional role of protecting livestock.\nBy the end of World War II, nearly all the Kuvasz dogs in Hungary had been killed. The dogs had such a reputation for protecting their families that they were actively sought and killed by German and Soviet soldiers, while at the same time some German officers used to take Kuvasz dogs home with them.  After the Soviet invasion and the end of the war, the breed was nearly extinct in Hungary. After the war, it was revealed that fewer than thirty Kuvasz were left in Hungary and some sources indicate the number may have been as few as twelve. Since then, due to many dedicated breeders, Kuvasz breed have repopulated Hungary.  However, as a result of this near extinction, the genetic pool available to breeders was severely restricted and there is conjecture that some may have used other breeds, such as the Great Pyrenees, to continue their programs. The issue is further clouded by the need to use an open stud book system at the time to rebuild the breed.\n\n\n=== Possible origins of the breed name ===\nThe word most likely comes from the Turkic word kavas meaning guard or soldier or kuwasz meaning protector. A related theory posits that the word may have originated from the ancient farmers of Russia, the Chuvash, who nurtured the breed for generations and contributed many words to the Hungarian language.\n\n\n== Grooming ==\nThe Kuvasz's stiff, dense coat, growing up to 15 cm (6 inches) in length, does not require any special grooming. It needs to be brushed once a week or, better still, every two or three days. For standard grooming purposes, use of a grooming rake or a pin-brush with rounded pins is recommended. To remove stubborn knots, use a curry comb or a large-toothed comb. During the spring and autumn the Kuvasz moults (also known as shedding), and he will lose copious amounts of hair very quickly. Frequent brushing is therefore needed to keep his coat tidy. A Kuvasz should not smell or have an odor; such is usually a sign of illness or a poor diet.\n\n\n== Health ==\nAlthough generally a healthy and robust breed which can be expected to live approximately 12\u201314 years, the Kuvasz are prone to developmental bone problems. Accordingly, owners should take care to provide proper nutrition to their Kuvasz puppy and avoid subjecting the puppy to rough play. As with many large breeds, hip dysplasia, a painful and potentially debilitating condition, is not uncommon. Good genetics and proper nutrition as a puppy are key to avoiding these complications.\nThe belief that a large breed puppies including Kuvasz puppy should not be fed a diet high in calories or protein has largely been dispelled by studies. Bone and joint disorders are thought to be genetic. However, weight can be an influencing factor. Puppies should be fed a balanced diet.  The Kuvasz has a very efficient metabolism and is predisposed to rapid growth\u2014vitamin supplements are not necessary and, in fact, should be avoided. Cooked bones should never be given to a Kuvasz or any other dog because the cooking process renders the bone brittle and prone to splintering, which can cause serious injury to the dog's mouth and digestive tract.\nIt is important breeders screen their breeding stock for common inherited disease for Kuvasz as recommended by the Canine Health Information Center.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Similar Breeds ==\nItalian Abruzzese Sheepdog\nFrench Great Pyrenees\nSlovak Cuvac\nTurkish Akbash Dog\nPolish Tatra Sheepdog\nLabrador Retriever\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notations ===\nH\u00f3dosi, J\u00f3zsef, ed.

It is also known as a Maltese Lion dog, and is often confused with the lhasa-maltese hybrids or Lhatese. While the Kyi-Leo is officially classified as a particular breed or brand, the Lhatese remains a hybrid to cover mixes of the two other breeds.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was first introduced in the 1950s in the San Francisco Bay area by the accidental crossing of a Maltese and a Lhasa Apso, which caught the attention of several individuals.  The most notable was Mrs. Harriet Linn, who acquired several of these dogs in 1965 and later acquired several more from the San Jose kennel in 1969; from then on she began to seriously breed them.  In 1972 there was enough interest among owners and breeders to come together and formally recognize this breed. It was at this meeting that they formally decided on calling it a Kyi-Leo.  The name comes from the Tibetan and Latin languages.  \u201cKyi\u201d is the Tibetan word for dog; this acknowledges the Lhasa Apso breed which first came from Tibet.  \u201cLeo\u201d is the Latin word for Lion; this acknowledges the Maltese which is also known as the \u201cMaltese Lion dog\u201d.  Since then the Kyi-Leo breed has slowly spread throughout the United States, and has recently become accepted by the American Rare Breed Association as a legitimate breed.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Kyi-Leo reaches 8-12 inches in height and 9-14 pounds in weight.  It has a long silky coat, most commonly black and white but sometimes gold and white, which tends to grow to long lengths (never quite reaching past the floor) if tended properly.  Its hair also grows on its face and tail.  It has small yet delicate legs that are prone to damage if dropped, but the Kyi-Leo can be very agile and quick. The Kyi-Leo has notable similarities, in body size, shape, and hair, to the Shih Tzu dog breed though the eyes are more human set rather than bulging and they do not have the short-snout face.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Kyi-Leo is generally calm, obedient, quiet, and difficult to provoke.  It is usually very playful and active around trusted humans or animals, but tends to stay cautious and alert around strangers.  Its acute hearing makes it a decent watchdog. It ideally lives in indoor settings and can be very patient when left alone for long hours at a time.\n\n\n== Health ==\nBecause of its small size, the Kyi-Leo has delicate legs and a delicate spine.  A slipped patella or back pains, due to a lot of jumping or aggressive handling, are notable among Kyi-Leos.\nBecause of its thick hair and Tibetan ancestry, the Kyi-Leo adapts best to colder climates.\nFood intake is also an issue, as the Kyi-Leo can easily become overweight due to its small frame.\nThe intake of human food, especially meat, is generally discouraged for the Kyi-Leo since its stomach cannot easily handle it.  Kyi-Leos have been prone to pancreatitis, noticeable by excessive vomiting and a tender abdomen, which greatly limits the types of food they can eat.  Most generic dog-food with a good source of protein is the best choice for Kyi-Leos.\nThe average lifespan of a Kyi-Leo is 13 to 15 years.\n\n\n== Notable dogs ==\nAmerican singer Mariah Carey owns two Kyi-Leo dogs that were given to her as puppies in Tokyo, Japan, during her Butterfly World Tour. They currently reside in Brooklyn, New York City.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLap dog\nRare breeds\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Other sources ==\n\"Dog Day Afternoon Helps Poor Pooches.\" Times - Picayune.

It is commonly mistaken for a Husky-Lab mix but in fact, it is its own breed. The Labrador Husky was originally brought to what is currently known as Labrador, Canada, in the 1300s by the Inuit. Its main purpose was to help the Inuit people survive in a highly demanding environment. The Labrador Husky was trained to pull sleds that transported goods. Labrador Huskies are known to be large but gentle dogs. The breed can grow to be bigger than the more commonly known Siberian Husky weighing in at 60-100 pounds. The dogs were later domesticated to serve as a family pets. Labrador Huskies are good with children when trained properly and require a committed owner to maintain their needs. Some of these needs include proper grooming which involves regular brushing of its thick double coat. This breed does tend to have some serious health problems, including hip dysplasia, but in general, Labrador Huskies live anywhere between 10 to 13 years.\n\n\n== Origin and history ==\nThe Labrador Husky originated in Labrador, the northern mainland region of what is currently called the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The breed was brought to the area by the Thule Inuit people in 1300 AD. Although Labrador Huskies were once very closely related to other Northern husky breeds, like the Siberian Husky, they became isolated in Labrador thus develop independently of the other breeds.\nTheir history of being bred with wolves does not mean that they are wolf-dogs, nor do they have any recent wolf ancestry. However, they still retain some of their wolf-like physical features. Although they have been isolated, some Labradorian people have introduced the blood of the Alaskan Malamute in order to improve its sledding skills and later for trainability purposes, the German Shepherd Dog. This has created another sled dog that looks strikingly similar to the Siberian Husky, but is much larger and more wolf-like.\n\nThis breed had helped people to lead sleds until snowmobiles were invented. From then on, it got much less common for the dog to be used as a sled dog to lead heavy loads. These days, it is often the case that the breed is seen in dog races or help to find and save lost people. However, most people have the dogs as their house pets now.\n\n\n== Health issues ==\nLabrador Huskies have several health problems that can impair their bodies. These issues are similar to those that are commonly found in the Siberian Husky. One of the most prominent health issues is musculoskeletal issues, including hip dysplasia. Hip dysplasia is common, and its effects on dogs' quality of life is immense. If left untreated the dog will lose mobility of their leg and be in great discomfort. The labrador husky can also be in danger of gastric dilation volvulus, simply known as bloat. Common health problems that associate with this breed are arthritis, degenerative myelopathy, eye and skin disease. Cataracts can affect this breed so, severe the victim can go blind. Heart disease, laryngeal paralysis and epilepsy can affect the Labrador Husky. These health concerns can end the life of the breed early. Despite all these dangers, the lifespan is from 10\u201313 years.\n\n\n== Domestication ==\nThe Labrador Husky had its first contact with humans was when it was used primarily as a working dog. This dog was not thought of as a pet but rather as an animal used for the benefit of the people who put it to work. It was commonly thought that this type of dog was not a friendly breed and would not be good in a family setting primary because of its past. This notion has since been disproven, as the Labrador Husky has become a fairly common family pet. There are still groups of people like the Labrador Inuit and Metis who use the Labrador Husky in its undomesticated form for recreational dog sledding and, some even prefer to use a dog team instead of a snowmobile. Sled dog racing continues to be a winter pastime in Labrador, with long races similar to the Iditarod still happening today.The process of domesticating a Labrador Husky does not stray far from what you would do in order to train a more commonly known family dog like a Golden Retriever. Because of its extremely high level of intelligence, the Labrador Husky must be very well trained. This breed of dog is known to respond well to training by an owner or professional who uses positive reinforcement. It is best to start training while these dogs are still puppies so that no bad habits develop. Lack of training and an owner who is not committed to the dog's overall needs will prove to be detrimental to the dogs behavior. The Labrador Husky loves to be surrounded by other dogs for companionship. Contact with other dogs and humans is vital for the dogs overall mental health and ability to be able to function in an urban setting. They are now often kept as a house pet.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Labrador Husky has a similar temperament to other Northern breeds such as Siberian Husky, Alaskan Husky, Alaskan Malamute, Canadian Eskimo Dog and so forth. It rarely barks but does tend to howl. The breed can be friendly and not aggressive with strangers and is well behaved if socialized properly. They are also good at getting along with family members and are intelligent and loyal animals. These dogs often do well with children as well, especially if reared with them together.Being with other dogs makes them happier because they are bred to work well in a pack. However, its strong prey drive might make it dangerous for owners to have smaller pets with it, but if they meet each other in their early ages, it should be safe.Owners need plenty of time to take care of the dogs because they require a good deal of exercise and owners' attention as well as mental stimulation.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Labrador Husky is a fairly large dog that can weigh between 60 and 100 pounds and can grow to 20 - 28 inches.  Thick, double coated fur protects these dogs from the bitterly cold temperatures that come with Labrador's long winters.\nThe husky's head is broad and has a long, narrow muzzle. The chest is wide and heavy boned. The husky's muscular and stout body is a unique physical trait, especially when compared to a Siberian Husky. Coat colors include solid white, solid black, black and white, red and white, and grey and white. There are two rare coat colors that can also be found in this breed: wolf grey and solid grey. Any coat color can appear in any litter; the most common colors are black and white, gray and white, and solid black.This breed has existed for hundreds of years and has become a unique breed due to its isolation from other northern dog breeds over this time. Labrador Huskies were used for transportation for many years until the advent of the snowmobile.\nToday, in isolated communities in northern Labrador, spaying and neutering is extremely expensive and logistically difficult. Dog breeding is therefore largely unmonitored and uncontrolled. This has resulted in a great variety of Labrador Husky mixes. It is unclear how many \"purebred\" Labrador Huskies are left in their region of origin, but many of the mixes retain that distinctive wolf-like facial shape.\nOf all the northern dog breeds, the Labrador Husky is one of the rarest, with less than an estimated 50-60 purebred Labrador Huskies currently identified in Labrador. As a result, the breed is not well understood by many dog breeders.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nSimilar to that of a Siberian Husky.\nBoth dogs have a specific type of coat known as a double coat to help them bare the cold weather.\nThe Labrador Husky is normally black, red, white, grey or, a combination of these colors.\n\n\n=== Eyes ===\nWhen a litter of puppies is born, eye color can differentiate between them.\nLabrador Huskies can have blue eyes or brown eyes.\nSome have one brown eye and one blue eye.\n\n\n=== Nose ===\nThe nose of the Labrador Husky is long and narrow and can differ in color.\nThese colors may include black, brown and a flesh color.\n\n\n=== Size and body ===\nThis large breed is sized between the Siberian Husky and the Alaskan Malamute.\nThis breed ranges from 20 to 28 inches between the shoulder blades.\nThe weight can be massive, up to 100 lbs, and can be as low as 60 lbs.\nThe body was bred for sledding, which makes the breed have strong swiftness that allows for aerodynamic conformation.\nThe Labrador Husky was bred for a strong body and legs.\nTheir paws are webbed for better grip on the snow.\n\n\n== Grooming ==\nLabrador Huskies require extensive grooming during all parts of the year. Its extremely thick and durable coat, also known as a double coat.  was made to be able to withstand harsh winters in Labrador Canada. Daily brushing is required to maintain the coat. A bath is sometimes the best way to fully groom and clean the dog. Bathing the dog does not have to be done on a regular basis, but is important in order to ensure a clean and well-groomed dog. It is also vital that the owner of a Labrador Husky checks for fleas and ticks during the warmer months. Because this dog has such a thick coat, it is the perfect place for a tick or flea to nestle in. Not checking for these things can lead to serious problems such as Lyme disease, which can be life-threatening to the dog. The Labrador Husky sheds constantly throughout the year, so it is important to keep up with its grooming.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGray wolf\nSled dog\nGreenland dog\nTamaskan dog\nWolf hybrid\nSiberian Husky\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works cited ==\nBurke, A.

The Labrador is one of the most popular breeds of dog in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.A favourite disability assistance breed in many countries, Labradors are frequently trained to aid the blind, those who have autism, to act as a therapy dog, or to perform screening and detection work for law enforcement and other official agencies. Additionally, they are prized as sporting and hunting dogs.A few kennels breeding their ancestors, the St. John's water dog, were in England. At the same time, a combination of the sheep protection policy in Newfoundland and the rabies quarantine in the United Kingdom led to the gradual demise of the St. John's water dog in Canada.In the 1830s, the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord John Scott, had imported progenitors of the breed from Newfoundland to Europe for use as gundogs. Another early advocate of these Newfoundland dogs, or Labrador Retrievers as they later became known, was the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury who bred them for their expertise in waterfowling.During the 1880s, the 3rd Earl of Malmesbury, the 6th Duke of Buccleuch and the 12th Earl of Home collaborated to develop and establish the modern Labrador breed. The dogs Buccleuch Avon and Buccleuch Ned, given by Malmesbury to Buccleuch, were mated with female dogs carrying blood from those originally imported by the 5th Duke and the 10th Earl of Home. The offspring are considered to be the ancestors of modern Labradors.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe modern Labrador's ancestors originated on the island of Newfoundland, now part of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The founding breed of the Labrador was the St. John's water dog, a breed that emerged through ad-hoc breedings by early settlers of the island in the 16th century. The forebears of the St. John's Dog are not known, but were likely a random-bred mix of English, Irish, and Portuguese working breeds. The Newfoundland (known then as the Greater Newfoundland) is likely a result of the St. John's Dog breeding with mastiffs brought to the island by the generations of Portuguese fishermen who had been fishing offshore since the 16th century. The smaller short-coated St. John's Dog (also known then as the Lesser Newfoundland) was used for retrieval and pulling in nets from the water. These smaller dogs were the forebears of the Labrador Retriever. The white chest, feet, chin, and muzzle \u2013 known as tuxedo markings \u2013 characteristic of the St. John's Dog often appear in modern Lab mixes, and will occasionally manifest in Labradors as a small white spot on the chest (known as a medallion) or stray white hairs on the feet or muzzle.\n\n\n== Early descriptions ==\n\nSeveral early descriptions of the St. John's water dog exist. In 1822, explorer W.E. Cormack crossed the island of Newfoundland by foot. In his journal he wrote \"The dogs are admirably trained as retrievers in fowling, and are otherwise useful.....The smooth or short haired dog is preferred because in frosty weather the long haired kind become encumbered with ice on coming out of the water.\"An early report by a Colonel Hawker described the dog as \"by far the best for any kind of shooting. He is generally black and no bigger than a Pointer, very fine in legs, with short, smooth hair and does not carry his tail so much curled as the other; is extremely quick, running, swimming and fighting....and their sense of smell is hardly to be credited....\"The first St. John's dog was said to be brought to England in or around 1820, but the breed's reputation had already spread to England; there is a story that the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury saw a St. John's dog on a fishing boat and immediately made arrangements with traders to have some of these dogs imported to England. These ancestors of the first labradors so impressed the Earl with their skill and ability for retrieving anything within the water and on shore that he devoted his entire kennel to developing and stabilising the breed.In his book Excursions in and About Newfoundland During the Years 1839 and 1840, the geologist Joseph Beete Jukes describes the St. John's water dog. \"A thin, short-haired, black dog came off-shore to us to-day. The animal was of a breed very different from what we understand by the term Newfoundland dog in England. He had a thin, tapering snout, a long thin tail, and rather thin, but powerful legs, with a lank body, \u2013 the hair short and smooth.\" wrote Jukes. \"These are the most abundant dogs in the country...They are no means handsome, but are generally more intelligent and useful than the others...I observed he once or twice put his foot in the water and paddled it about. This foot was white, and Harvey said he did it to \"toil\" or entice the fish. The whole proceeding struck me as remarkable, more especially as they said he had never been taught anything of the kind.\"\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe foundational breed of what is now the Labrador Retriever was known as the St. John's water dog, St. John's dog, or Lesser Newfoundland. When the dogs were later brought to England, they were named after the geographic area known as \"the Labrador\" (they were known as Labrador Retrievers because they \"retrieved\" in the Labrador Sea) or simply Labrador to distinguish them from the larger Newfoundland breed, even though the breed was from the more southern Avalon Peninsula.\nThe progenitors of the Labrador retriever were actually from Newfoundland and Labrador exceptionally, the breed known as the Newfoundland was created near the same time in Labrador. The two breeds' names and origins were mixed once moved into England and both North and South America. The dog from Labrador became the large, long-furred dog we see and know today, and the dog from Newfoundland became the Labrador.\n\n\n== Historical landmarks ==\nThe first written reference to the breed was in 1814 (\"Instructions to Young Sportsmen\" by Colonel Peter Hawker), the first painting in 1823 (\"Cora. A Labrador Bitch\" by Edwin Landseer), and the first photograph in 1856 (the Earl of Home's dog \"Nell\", described both as a Labrador and a St. Johns dog). By 1870 the name Labrador Retriever became common in England. The first yellow Labrador on record was born in 1899 (Ben of Hyde, kennels of Major C.J. Radclyffe), and the breed was recognised by The Kennel Club in 1903. The first American Kennel Club (AKC) registration was in 1917. The chocolate Labrador emerged in the 1930s, although liver spotted pups were documented being born at the Buccleuch kennels in 1892. The first dog to appear on the cover of Life Magazine was a black Labrador Retriever called \"Blind of Arden\" in the December, 12th, 1938 issue. The St. John's dog survived until the early 1980s, the last two individuals being photographed in old age around 1981.\n\n\n== History of subtypes ==\n\nLabrador Retrievers are often categorised in one of two ways: English Labs or American Labs.  The differences are principally behavioural, though there are differences in appearance as well.  Behaviorally, English Labs tend to be more easily trainable, and are often considered better for non-professional owners to keep as pets or hunting companions. American Labs tend to be more energetic and, having been bred to compete in field trials, are better suited for professional owners with more experience and time to devote to training.  In terms of appearance, English Labs tend to more prominently exhibit the 'blocky' heads for which Labrador Retrievers are known, whereas American Labs tend to be leaner and longer-legged.\n\n\n=== Yellow (and similar shades) ===\nIn the early years of the breed through to the mid-20th century, Labradors of a shade we would now call \"yellow\" were in fact a dark, almost butterscotch, colour (visible in early yellow Labrador photographs). The shade was known as \"Golden\" until required to be changed by the UK Kennel Club, on the grounds that \"Gold\" was not actually a colour. Over the 20th century a preference for far lighter shades of yellow through to cream prevailed; until today most yellow Labradors are of this shade. Also fawn has been a common colour in the yellow lab variety.Interest in the darker shades of gold and fox red were re-established by English breeders in the 1980s, and three dogs were instrumental in this change: Balrion King Frost (black, born c. 1976) who consistently sired \"very dark yellow\" offspring and is credited as having \"the biggest influence in the re-development of the fox red shade\", and his great-grandson, the likewise famous Wynfaul Tabasco (b. 1986), described as \"the father of the modern fox red Labrador\", and the only modern fox red Show Champion in the UK. Other dogs, such as Red Alert and Scrimshaw Placido Flamingo, are also credited with passing on the genes into more than one renowned bloodline.\nYellow Labradors\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Chocolate Labradors ===\nJack Vanderwyk traces the origins of all Chocolate Labradors listed on the LabradorNet database (some 34,000 Labrador dogs of all shades) to eight original bloodlines. However, the shade was not seen as a distinct colour until the 20th century; before then, according to Vanderwyk, such dogs can be traced but were not registered. A degree of crossbreeding with Flatcoat or Chesapeake Bay retrievers was also documented in the early 20th century, prior to recognition. Chocolate Labradors were also well established in the early 20th century at the kennels of the Earl of Feversham, and Lady Ward of Chiltonfoliat.The bloodlines as traced by Vanderwyk each lead back to three black Labradors in the 1880s\u2014Buccleuch Avon (m), and his sire and dam, Malmesbury Tramp (m), and Malmesbury June (f). Morningtown Tobla is also named as an important intermediary, and according to the studbook of Buccleuch Kennels, the chocolates in this kennel came through FTW Peter of Faskally (1908).\nChocolate Labradors\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nLabradors are medium-large, with males typically weighing 65\u201380 lb (29\u201336 kg) and females 55\u201370 lb (25\u201332 kg). The majority of the characteristics of this breed, with the exception of colour, are the result of breeding to produce a working retriever.\nAs with some other breeds, the Conformation (typically \"Show\", \"English\" or \"bench\") and the Field (typically \"Working\" or \"American\") lines differ, although both lines are bred in both countries. In general, however, Conformation Labradors tend to be bred as medium-sized dogs, shorter and stockier with fuller faces and a slightly calmer nature than their Field counterparts, which are often bred as taller, lighter-framed dogs, with slightly less broad faces and a slightly longer nose. However, Field Labradors should still be proportional and fit within American Kennel Club standards. With Field Labradors, excessively long noses, thin heads, long legs, and lanky frames are not considered standard. These two types are informal and not codified or standardised; no distinction is made by the AKC or other kennel clubs, but the two types come from different breeding lines. Australian stock also exists; though not seen in the West, they are common in Asia. These dogs are also very good with children.\nThe breed tends to shed hair twice annually or regularly throughout the year in temperate climates. Some Labradors shed considerably; however, individual Labradors vary. Labrador hair is usually short and straight, and the tail is quite broad and strong. The webbed toes of the Labrador Retriever make them excellent swimmers. The webbing between their toes can also serve as a \"snowshoe\" in colder climates and keep snow from balling up between their toes\u2014a condition that can be painful to other breeds with hair between the toes. Their interwoven coat is also relatively waterproof, providing more assistance for swimming.\n\n\n==== Official breed standards ====\nThere is a great deal of variety among Labradors. The following characteristics are typical of the conformation show bred (bench-bred) lines of this breed in the United States and are based on the American Kennel Club standard. Significant differences between UK and US standards are noted.\n\nSize: Labradors are a medium-large breed. They should be as long from the withers to the base of the tail as they are from the floor to the withers. The AKC standard includes an ideal weight for males of 65\u201380 lb (29\u201336 kg) and for females as 55\u201370 lb (25\u201332 kg). The guidelines for height vary between the AKC, which gives 22.5 to 24.5 inches (57 to 62 cm) for males and 21.5 to 23.5 inches (55 to 60 cm) for females, The Kennel Club which advises that males should be 56 to 57 centimetres (22 to 22 in) with females between 55 to 56 centimetres (22 to 22 in), and the FCI which quotes a range of 56 to 57 centimetres (22 to 22 in) for males with females ideal at 54 to 56 centimetres (21 to 22 in).\nCoat: The Labrador Retriever's coat should be short and dense, but not wiry. The coat is water-resistant, so the dog does not get cold when taking to water in the winter. That means that the dog naturally has a slightly dry, oily coat. Acceptable colours are black, yellow, and chocolate.\nHead: The head should be broad with slightly pronounced eyebrows. The eyes should be kind and expressive. Appropriate eye colours are brown and hazel. The lining around the eyes should be black. The ears should hang close to the head and set slightly above the eyes.\nJaws: The jaws should be strong and powerful. The muzzle should be of medium length and should not be too tapered. The jaws should hang slightly and curve gracefully back.\nBody: The body should have a powerful and muscular build.The tail and coat are designated \"distinctive [or distinguishing] features\" of the Labrador by both the Kennel Club and AKC. The AKC adds that \"true Labrador Retriever temperament is as much a hallmark of the breed as the 'otter' tail.\"\n\n\n==== Colour ====\n\nLabrador Retrievers are registered in three colours: black (a solid black colour), yellow (considered from cream to fox-red), and chocolate (medium to dark brown). Some dogs are sold as silver pure-bred Labradors, but purity of those bloodlines is currently disputed by breed experts including breed clubs and breed councils. Some major kennel clubs around the world allow silver Labradors to be registered, but not as silver. The Kennel Club (England) requires that they be registered as \"Non-recognised.\"\nOccasionally, Labradors will exhibit small amounts of white fur on their chest, paws, or tail, and rarely a purebred Lab will exhibit brindling stripes or tan points similar to a Rottweiler. These markings are a disqualification for show dogs but do not have any bearing on the dog's temperament or ability to be a good working or pet dog.\n\nPuppies of all colours can potentially occur in the same litter. Colour is determined primarily by three genes. The first gene (the B locus) determines the density of the coat's eumelanin pigment granules, if that pigment is allowed: dense granules result in a black coat, sparse ones give a chocolate coat. The second (E) locus determines whether the eumelanin is produced at all. A dog with the recessive e allele will produce only phaeomelanin pigment and will be yellow regardless of its genotype at the B locus. The genes known about previously have had their number increased by the introduction of the K locus, where the dominant \"black\" allele KB is now known to reside. Black or chocolate Labradors therefore must have the KB allele. Yellow Labradors are determined at the E locus, so the K locus is irrelevant in determining their colour. Variations in numerous other genes control the subtler details of the coat's colouration, which in yellow Labradors varies from white to light gold to a fox red. Chocolate and black Labradors' noses will match the coat colour.\nAccording to a 2011 study, 13 out of 245 Labradors studied were heterozygous for the M264V mutation responsible for the melanistic mask, and one was homozygous. Within the breed, this trait is not visible.\n\n\n===== Nose and skin pigmentation =====\nLabrador colouration is controlled by multiple genes. It is possible for recessive genes to re-emerge in later generations. Also, there can sometimes be unexpected pigmentation effects to different parts of the body. Pigmentation effects appear in regard to yellow Labradors, and sometimes chocolate, and hence the majority of this section covers pigmentation within the yellow Labrador. The most common places where pigmentation is visible are the nose, lips, gums, feet, tail, and the rims of the eyes, which may be black, brown, light yellow-brown (\"liver\", caused by having two genes for chocolate), or several other colours. A Labrador can carry genes for a different colour, for example a black Labrador can carry recessive chocolate and yellow genes, and a yellow Labrador can carry recessive genes for the other two colours. DNA testing can reveal some aspects of these. Less common pigmentations (other than pink) are a fault, not a disqualification, and hence such dogs are still permitted to be shown.The intensity of black pigment on yellow Labradors is controlled by a separate gene independent of the fur colouring. Yellow Labradors usually have black noses, which may gradually turn pink with age (called \"snow nose\" or \"winter nose\"). This is due to a reduction in the enzyme tyrosinase which indirectly controls the production of melanin, a dark colouring. Tyrosinase is temperature dependent\u2014hence light colouration can be seasonal, due to cold weather\u2014and is less produced with increasing age two years old onwards. As a result, the nose colour of most yellow Labradors becomes a somewhat pink shade as they grow older.A colouration known as \"Dudley\" is also possible. Dudleys are variously defined as yellow Labradors which have unpigmented (pink) noses (LRC), yellow with liver/chocolate pigmentation (AKC), or \"flesh coloured\" in addition to having the same colour around the rims of the eye, rather than having black or dark brown pigmentation. A yellow Labrador with brown or chocolate pigmentation, for example, a brown or chocolate nose, is not necessarily a Dudley, though according to the AKC's current standard it would be if it has chocolate rims around the eyes (or more accurately of the genotype eebb). Breed standards for Labradors considers a true Dudley to be a disqualifying feature in a conformation show Lab, such as one with a thoroughly pink nose or one lacking in any pigment along with flesh coloured rims around the eyes. True Dudleys are extremely rare.\nBreeding in order to correct pigmentation often lacks dependability. Because colour is determined by many genes, some of which are recessive, crossbreeding a pigmentation non-standard yellow Labrador to a black Labrador may not correct the matter or prevent future generations carrying the same recessive genes. For similar reasons, crossbreeding chocolate to yellow Labradors is also often avoided.\n\n\n==== Show and field lines ====\n\nAs a result of specialised breeding there are significant differences between field and trial-bred and show-bred lines of Labradors. In the United States the former are sometimes mistakenly referred to as \"American\" and the latter as \"English\" although both field and show types are bred in both countries. In the United Kingdom they are called \"Field\" and \"Show\". Dogs bred for hunting and field-trial work are selected first for working ability, where dogs bred to compete in conformation shows are selected for their conformation to the standards and characteristics sought by judges in the show ring.\nWhile individual dogs may vary, in general show-bred Labradors are heavier built, slightly shorter-bodied, and have a thicker coat and tail. Field Labradors are generally longer-legged, lighter, and more lithe in build, making them agile. In the head, show Labradors tend to have broader heads, better defined stops, and more powerful necks, while field Labradors have lighter and slightly narrower heads with longer muzzles.\nField-bred Labradors are commonly higher energy and more high-strung compared to the Labrador bred for conformation showing while conformation breeds are calmer in energy, and as a consequence may be more suited to working relationships than being a \"family pet\". Some breeders, especially those specialising in the field type, feel that breed shows do not adequately recognise their type of dog, leading to occasional debate regarding officially splitting the breed into subtypes.In the United States, the American Kennel Club (AKC) and the Labrador's breed club have set the breed standard to accommodate the field-bred Labrador somewhat. For instance, the AKC withers-height standards allow conformation dogs to be slightly taller than the equivalent British standard. However, dual champions, or dogs that excel in both the field and the show ring, are becoming more unusual.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe AKC describes the Labrador's temperament as a kind, pleasant, outgoing and tractable nature. Labradors' sense of smell allows them to home in on almost any scent and follow the path of its origin. They generally stay on the scent until they find it. Navies, military forces and police forces use them as detection dogs to track down smugglers, thieves, terrorists and black marketers.  They are known to have a very soft feel to the mouth, as a result of being bred to retrieve game such as waterfowl. They are prone to chewing objects (though they can be trained to abandon this behaviour).\n\nLabradors have a reputation as a very even-tempered breed and an excellent family dog. This includes a good reputation with children of all ages and other animals. Some lines, particularly those that have continued to be bred specifically for their skills at working in the field (rather than for their appearance), are particularly fast and athletic. Their fun-loving boisterousness and lack of fear may require training and firm handling at times to ensure it does not get out of hand\u2014an uncontrolled adult can be quite problematic. Females may be slightly more independent than males. Labradors mature at around three years of age; before this time they can have a significant degree of puppy-like energy, often mislabelled as being hyperactive. Because of their enthusiasm, leash-training early on is suggested to prevent pulling when full-grown. Labradors often enjoy retrieving a ball endlessly (often obsessively) and other forms of activity (such as agility, frisbee, or flyball).Although they will sometimes bark at noise, especially noise from an unseen source (\"alarm barking\"), Labradors are usually not noisy or territorial. They are often very easygoing and trusting with strangers and therefore are not usually suitable as guard dogs.Labradors as a breed are curious and exploratory and love company, following both people and interesting scents for food, attention, and novelty value. In this way, they can often \"vanish\" or otherwise become separated from their owners with little fanfare. As a breed they are highly intelligent and capable of intense single-mindedness and focus if motivated or their interest is caught. Therefore, with the right conditions and stimuli, a bored Labrador could \"turn into an escape artist par excellence\". Many dogs are also stolen. Because of their curious nature and ability to \"vanish,\" along with the risk of being stolen, a number of dog clubs and rescue organisations (including the UK's Kennel Club) consider it good practice that Labradors be microchipped, with the owner's name and address also on their collar and tags.The steady temperament of Labradors and their ability to learn make them an ideal breed for search and rescue, detection, and therapy work. They are a very intelligent breed. They are ranked No. 7 in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs. The AKC describes the breed as an ideal family and sporting dog. Their primary working role in the field continues to be that of a hunting retriever.\n\n\n=== Use as working dogs ===\n\nLabradors are an intelligent breed with a good work ethic and generally good temperaments.  Common working roles for Labradors include: hunting, tracking and detection (they have a great sense of smell which helps when working in these areas), disabled-assistance, carting, and therapy work. Approximately 60\u201370% of all guide dogs in Canada are Labradors; other common breeds are Golden Retrievers and German Shepherds.\nLabrador Retrievers have proven to have a high success rate at becoming guide dogs. A study was recently done on how well four different breeds (Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix, and German Shepherds) trained to become guide dogs. In this experiment, German Shepherds had the highest chance of not completing it. Labrador Retrievers and Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix had the highest success rate. However, German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers had a higher success rate after going through longer training than the training required for Labrador Retrievers.Labradors are powerful and indefatigable swimmers noted for their ability to tolerate the coldest of water for extended periods of time. Their ability to work quietly alongside hunters while watching for birds to fall from the sky, marking where they land, and then using their outstanding nose to find and retrieve dead or wounded birds has made them the king of waterfowl retrievers.\nThey are also used for pointing and flushing and make excellent upland game hunting partners.The high intelligence, initiative and self-direction of Labradors in working roles is exemplified by dogs such as Endal, who is trained to, if need be, put his wheelchair-bound human in the recovery position, cover him with a blanket, and activate an emergency phone. A number of Labradors have also been taught to assist their owner in removing money and credit cards from ATMs with prior training.The breed is used in water rescue/lifesaving. It continues in that role today, along with the Leonberger, Newfoundland and Golden Retriever dogs; they are used at the Italian School of Canine Lifeguard.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIn 2014, the UK breed survey reported an average lifespan for the Labrador Retriever of 12 years and 3 months, with some living up to 19 years of age. Labrador pups generally are not brought to the home before they are 8 weeks old.It is a healthy breed with relatively few major problems. Notable issues related to health and well-being include inherited disorders and obesity.\n\n\n=== Inherited disorders ===\nLabradors are somewhat prone to hip and elbow dysplasia, especially the larger dogs, though not as much as some other breeds. Hip scores are recommended before breeding and often joint supplements are recommended.\nLabradors also suffer from the risk of knee problems. A luxating patella is a common occurrence in the knee where the knee dislocates and goes back into place.\nEye problems are also possible in some Labradors, particularly progressive retinal atrophy, cataracts, corneal dystrophy and retinal dysplasia. Dogs which are intended to be bred should be examined by a veterinary ophthalmologist for an eye score.\nHereditary myopathy, a rare inherited disorder that causes a deficiency in type II muscle fibre. Symptoms include a short stilted gait or \"bunny hopping,\" and in rare cases ventroflexion of the neck accompanied by a kyphotic posture.\nThere is a small incidence of other conditions, such as autoimmune diseases and deafness in Labradors, either congenitally or later in life.\nLabradors often suffer from exercise induced collapse, a syndrome that causes hyperthermia, weakness, collapse, and disorientation after short bouts of exercise.\nOut of all dog breeds it is the Labrador Retriever that is most likely to become obese. This obesity has been attributed to a specific gene mutation. See the Obesity subsection below.\n\n\n=== Obesity ===\n\nLabradors like to eat, and without proper exercise can become obese. Laziness is a contribution to this. Obesity is a serious condition and can be considered the number one nutritional problem with dogs. A study shows that at least 25% of dogs in the United States are overweight. Therefore, Labradors must be properly exercised and stimulated. A healthy Labrador can do swimming wind sprints for two hours, and should keep a very slight hourglass waist and be fit and light, rather than fat or heavy-set. Obesity can exacerbate conditions such as hip dysplasia and joint problems, and can lead to secondary diseases, including diabetes. Osteoarthritis is very common in older, especially overweight, Labradors. A 14-year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean body shape outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding. Labradors should be walked twice a day for at least half an hour.It has been shown that out of all dog breeds, it is the Labrador Retriever that is most likely to be obese. In a 2016 published study it was shown that out of 310 Labradors, most were missing all or parts of the POMC gene. This gene plays a part in appetite regulation as well as indication of the amount of one's stored fat. The study concluded that the absence of that gene had a significant impact on Labrador weight and appetite. The POMC gene mutation is present in only one other breed \u2013 the Flat-Coated Retriever.\n\n\n== Appearance around the world ==\nIn the United States, the breed gained wider recognition following a 1928 American Kennel Gazette article, \"Meet the Labrador Retriever\". Before this time, the AKC had only registered 23 Labradors in the country, in part because US and UK hunting styles had different requirements. Labradors acquired popularity as hunting dogs during the 1920s and especially after World War II, as they gained recognition as combining some of the best traits of the two favourite United States breeds as both game finders and water dogs.Outside North America and Western Europe, the Labrador arrived later. For example, the Russian Retriever Club traces the arrival of Labradors to the late 1960s, as household pets of diplomats and others in the foreign ministry. The establishment of the breed in the Commonwealth of Independent States (former USSR) was initially hindered by the relatively small numbers of Labradors and great distances involved, leading to difficulty establishing breedings and bloodlines; at the start of the 1980s, home-born dogs were still regularly supplemented by further imports from overseas. Difficulties such as these initially led to Labradors being tacitly cross-bred to other types of retriever. In the 1990s, improved access to overseas shows and bloodlines is said to have helped this situation become regularised.\n\n\n=== Demography ===\n\nThe Labrador is an exceptionally popular dog. For example, as of  2006:\n\n \nWidely considered the most popular breed in the world.\nMost popular dog by ownership in Australia, Canada, Israel, New Zealand United Kingdom, and United States (since 1991),\nIn both the United Kingdom and the United States, there are well over twice as many Labradors registered as the next most popular breed. If the comparison is limited to dog breeds of a similar size, then there are around 3\u20135 times as many Labradors registered in both countries as the next most popular breeds, the German Shepherd Dog and Golden Retriever.\nMost popular breed of assistance dog in the United States, Australia and many other countries, as well as being widely used by police and other official bodies for their detection and working abilities. Approximately 60\u201370% of all guide dogs in the United States are Labradors (see below).\nSeven out of 13 of the Australian National Kennel Council \"Outstanding Gundogs\" Hall of Fame appointees are Labradors (list covers 2000\u20132005).There is no global registry of Labradors, nor is there detailed information on numbers of Labradors living in each country. The countries with the five largest numbers of Labrador registrations as of 2005 are: 1: United Kingdom 2: France and United States (approximately equal), 4: Sweden, 5: Finland. Sweden and Finland have far lower populations than the other three countries, suggesting that as of  2005 these two countries have the highest proportion of Labradors per million people: As there is no global registry for Labradors, it is difficult to ascertain whether there is simply a smaller percentage of people formally registering their animals in countries like the United States, or whether the number of animals per capita is actually smaller.\n\nOFA statistics suggest that yellow and black Labradors are registered in very similar numbers (yellow slightly more than black); chocolate in lesser numbers.Note: The number of registrations is not necessarily the same as the number of living dogs at any given time.\n\n\n=== US military working dogs (war dogs): Labrador Retrievers in the Vietnam war ===\n\nThe Vietnam War is the only war in American history in which US war dogs, which were officially classified by the military as \"military working dogs,\" were not allowed to officially return home after the war. Classified as expendable equipment, of the approximate 4,000 US K-9s deployed to the Vietnam War, it is estimated that only about 200 US war dogs survived Vietnam to be put into service at other outposts stationed overseas. Aside from these 200 or so, the remaining canines who were not killed in action were either euthanised or left behind.The predominate canine selected by the US Military during the Vietnam War was the German Shepherd Dog, which was used in the roles of Scout Dogs, Sentry Dogs, Mine Detection Dogs, and the US Navy used Water Dogs  to detect enemy under water divers in South Vietnam.  The Labrador Retriever was the military's choice for their Combat Tracker Teams (CTTs).  Combat Tracker Teams consisted of one Labrador and four or five men: the handler, an observer, one or two cover men, and the team leader. Labradors were selected by the military for tracking because of their distinct smelling qualities, and were used to locate wounded US servicemen, enemy patrols, and downed allied airmen in Vietnam.  The US Army Labrador Retrievers received their combat training at the British Army's Jungle Warfare School in Malaysia.Of the over 4,000 US war dogs serving in the Vietnam War, 232 were killed in action, and 295 US servicemen deployed as \"dog handlers\" were killed in action. Dog handler Robert W. Hartsock was awarded the Medal of Honor.  Six Labrador Retrievers were killed in action while assigned to the 62nd and 63rd US Army Combat Tracking Teams. During the course of the war the US Army lost 204 dogs, while the US Marine Corps and US Air Force lost 13 and 15 dogs, respectively.\nIn November 2000, President Bill Clinton signed into law an amendment that allowed retired US military working dogs (war dogs) to be adopted by personnel outside of the military, leaving the Vietnam War as the only war in US history in which American war dogs never returned home.\n\n\n== Famous Labradors ==\n\nAs both the most popular breed by registered ownership and also the most popular breed for assistance dogs in several countries, there have been many notable and famous Labradors since the breed was recognised.\nA selection of a few of the most famous labradors within various categories includes:\n\n\n=== Assistance dogs ===\nEndal, a service dog in Britain. Among other distinctions, \"the most decorated dog in the world\" (including \"Dog of the Millennium\" and the PDSA's Gold Medal for Animal Gallantry and Devotion to Duty), the first dog to ride on the London Eye and the first dog known to work a 'chip and pin' ATM card. By Endal's death in March 2009, he and his owner/handler Allen Parton had been filmed almost 350 times by crews from several countries, and a film of a year in Endal's life was in production.\n\n\n=== Police, military, rescue and detection dogs ===\n\nZanjeer (\"Chain\", or \"Shackles\"), a detection dog who detected arms and ammunition used in the 1993 Mumbai (Bombay) serial explosions. During his service, he helped recover 57 country-made bombs, 175 petrol bombs, 11 military grade armaments, 242 grenades and 600 detonators. His biggest contribution to the police force and the city was the detection of 3,329 kg of RDX. He also helped detect 18 Type 56 rifles and five 9mm pistols.\nLucky and Flo, twin Black Labrador counterfeit-detection dogs who became famous in 2007 for \"sniffing out nearly 2 million counterfeit DVDs\" on a six-month secondment to Malaysia in 2007. Following the multimillion-dollar, 6-arrest Malaysian detection, they became the first dogs to be awarded Malaysia's \"outstanding service award\" and software pirates were stated to have put a \u00a330,000 contract out for their lives.\nSarbi, an Australian special forces explosives detection dog that spent almost 14 months missing in action (MIA) in Afghanistan before being recovered safe and well in 2009.\nJake, a well-known American black labrador who served as a search and rescue dog following the September 11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina.\nSalty and Roselle, awarded the Dickin Medal for conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving in military conflict. Guide dogs, led their blind owners down more than 70 flights of stairs to escape from the damaged World Trade Center in September 2001\nSadie, awarded the Dickin Medal for conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving in military conflict. Detected explosive devices, which were subsequently disarmed, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, in November 2005; served with the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment\nSasha, awarded the Dickin Medal for conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving in military conflict. Located 15 improvised explosive devices, mortars, mines, and weapons while serving in Afghanistan, with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps. In July 2008 Sasha and her handler were killed in a Taliban ambush by a rocket-propelled grenade.\n\n\n=== Pets ===\nFormer President of the United States Bill Clinton's Labradors Buddy and Seamus.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin's Labrador 'Koni'.\n\n\n=== Fiction and media ===\nBrian Griffin from the animated TV sitcom Family Guy is a white Labrador Retriever.\nBouncer in Neighbours, and Luath in The Incredible Journey, are also famous Labradors on TV.\nMarley is an American Labrador featured in Marley & Me, a best-selling book by John Grogan, and a subsequent film based on Grogan's life and times with Marley.\nOn the BBC children's television series Big Barn Farm, Digger is a yellow Labrador puppy.\nRowdy on Scrubs is a taxidermy golden Labrador Retriever involved in various gags on the show.\nVincent on Lost is a white Labrador Retriever.\nZuma on PAW Patrol is a chocolate Labrador Retriever.\nPharaoh, Isis, and Tiaa are yellow Labrador Retrievers in the television series Downton Abbey.\nBrandeis, a yellow Labrador Retriever, is a minor character on Sesame Street who finds employment as a Mobility assistance dog.\nMr. Peanutbutter, an anthropomorphized Labrador Retriever, from the animated TV show BoJack Horseman.\n\n\n=== Mascots and advertising ===\nSince 1972, a yellow Labrador pup known as the Andrex Puppy has been an advertising symbol for Andrex (Cottonelle) toilet tissue.\nMichigan State University has an ongoing tradition of Zeke the Wonder Dog.

The name means \"lake dog from Romagna,\" originating from the Italian word lago, meaning lake. Its traditional function is a gundog, specifically a water retriever; however, it is often used to hunt for truffles.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Lagotto Romagnolo is a curly coated dog with an appearance of being robust and hardy. All colors are allowed except black, the coat is dense and wooly in texture. The body is square and classified as medium in size. \n\nMales\nHeight: 43\u201348 cm (17\u201319 in)\nWeight: 13\u201316 kg  (29-35 lb)\nFemales\nHeight: 41\u201346 cm (16\u201318 in).\nWeight: 11\u201314 kg (24-32 lb).\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe Lagotto is a Sporting breed. They generally have sharp senses, although their eyesight is more sensitive to motion than to detail. The breed is very loyal and loving, making them the perfect family companion. Some are easy to train, and many get along with other animals quite easily if they are socialized as puppies. Lagotti vary in their need for exercise, but should always be given stimulation to keep their minds occupied. It is worth noting that the first pair (Reno and Rosetta) bought to pioneer the Lagotto in the UK in 1996, came from the Mandriole kennels on the edge of the Comacchio where the dogs were still worked from the traditional flat-bottomed punts as duck retrievers. These Lagotti, through subsequent exports from the UK which provided the foundation stock for Canada, USA and Australia, can be found behind many Lagotti worldwide. Visitors to the Lagotto Romagnolo Club of Great Britain breed, which stand at the world-famous Crufts Dog Show in the UK, will have seen photographs of British Lagotti (including Rosetta) retrieving hare, rabbit and various types of wildfowl. It is also worth noting that the photograph on the back of the first official video produced in Italy circa 1996, showed a group of Lagotti working - not truffling, but duck-shooting from a punt. In that punt were the parents and grandparents of Rosetta and Reno. The instinct to hunt, swim and retrieve is inborn and does not have to be encouraged. Lagotti have to be trained from an early age to look for truffles.\nIn modern times, the Lagotto has been bred primarily as a truffle-searching dog, and not as a retriever or hunting dog. Its highly developed noses makes it a prime search dog.\nSome Lagotti are excellent swimmers, while some will only paddle. Some will retrieve from lakes, streams and other bodies of water without hesitation. They are lovable family pets and tend to like attention. Lagotti love to dig. Many owners give them a sandbox, or have a designated place to allow them satisfy their digging urges. They also love to play seeking games and have very active and clever minds.\n\n\n== Grooming ==\nThere are conflicting ideas on how to groom this breed. Some say they should be brushed regularly and others believe their coat should be allowed to grow to a naturally fluffy coat. The Lagotto coat gets matted easily, and the mats should be carefully pulled apart without tearing the coat. The Lagotto has a thick, waterproof double coat of hair rather than fur and should be groomed on a regular basis. It is recommended that the coat be cut down at least once every year.\nIf the coat is kept trimmed to approximately 1.5 inches all over the body and slightly longer on the head, it will be easier to maintain. Hair on the ears should be trimmed around the edges to the leather. If the ears show irritation or buildup of dirt and earwax, the hairs from the ear canal should be gently plucked out regularly. Some coats matt more easily than others. If left untended, Lagotti hair will grow to cover the eyes. The hair around their eyes should be clipped periodically to ensure that they can see.\n\n\n== Show grooming ==\nIn the United States, the coat should be shown in a rustic style with no fluffing or blowing out. The coat should match the lines of the dog and the curls should be evident. The dog should have the appearance of the working dog that it is. If clipped down, the coat will need about 3 months of growth to be ready to show. Otherwise, shaping can be performed before a competition.\n\n\n== Health ==\nLagotto live roughly 16 years. Some health issues, especially neurological disorders are associated with this breed; however, these are mostly attributable to poor breeding.  Genetically testing prior to breeding is necessary to avoid the most common diseases in the breed. \nIssues include:\n\nHip dysplasia OFA scores, Penn Hip, Breeder has GD Hip Lineage\nBenign Juvenile Epilepsy Look for BJE +/-. You do not want to breed two carriers  NO +/+\nCerebral Anomaly. Specifically Cerebral Ataxia.  Good Breeders breed clear.\nLagotto Storage Diseases (LSD) You do not want to breed two carriers.A new neurodegenerative disorder, called \"Neuroaxonal Dystrophy\", that was originally identified in Spanish Water Dogs has been identified in the breed in 2016. It is not known yet whether it is related to the disorders already associated with the Lagotto Romagnolo. https://os.genoscoper.com/crm/disorders/323_TECPR2_SWD/os/323_TECPR2_SWD.pdf\nLagotto puppies are crucial in research regarding epilepsy. In July 2011, researchers in Finland reported the discovery of a mutation in a gene called Lgi2 that may be a new candidate gene for human benign childhood epilepsy. Lgi2 is the first gene that can be linked directly to the remission that carriers experience after the age of ten. Lagotto breeders are now using genetic tests to screen for the mutation.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Lagotto is an ancient breed of water retriever from the lowlands of Comacchio and marshlands of Ravenna, Italy.  Modern water retrieving dog breeds are believed to have descended in part from the Lagotto Ramagnolo. \nAndrea Mantegna in the 1474 work titled \"The Meeting\" depicts a small dog in the lower left corner that is the perfect image of today's Lagotto.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLagotto Romagnolo Foundation\nLagotto Romagnolo of Canada\nAmerican Kennel Club (Lagotto page)\nThe Lagotto Romagnolo Club of Great Britain\nLagotto Romagnolo Club of America.\nLagotto Club of America\nLagotto Club of Canada\nLagotto Club of The Netherlands\nLagotto Club of Finland\nThe Meeting by Andrea Mantegna\nDatabase of health tested Lagotti worldwide\nElevage fran\u00e7ais de Chiens d'eau Romagnol\nFCI Standard n\u00b0298 2011.03.02 Romagna Water Dog - Lagotto Romagnolo\nGenetic testing in the U.S.\nGenetic testing in Europe"}, {"id": 298, "name": "Lakeland Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog298", "description": "The Lakeland Terrier is a dog breed, which takes its name from its place of origin, the Lake District  in England. The dog is a small to mid-size member of the Terrier family. While independent in personality, it interacts well with owners and all family members, and is mostly hypo-allergenic (non shedding). The breed is not widely owned in the United States.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nAt 15\u201317 lb (7\u20138 kg), it is the smallest of the long legged, black and tan terriers. The Lakeland is similar in appearance to the slightly larger Welsh Terrier and is finer-boned. The largest of the threesome in this similar group of Terriers is the Airedale. The Lakeland is a sturdy dog, compact, free moving and able to cover ground with little effort and much quickness. \nThe dog is relatively narrow in the chest and has a broad muzzle, yet slightly narrower than the Welsh Terrier, with small, V-shaped ears.\nThe Lakeland breed has a thick bushy wiry outer coat and a soft undercoat. It comes in a variety of colors though The Kennel Club lists the following as 'Acceptable colours for registration': Black, Black and Tan, Blue and Tan, Dark Grizzle, Grizzle, Grizzle and Tan, Liver and Tan, Red, Red Grizzle, Wheaten.  They have an upright tail which was previously customarily docked. Lakeland Terriers grow to between 33 and 38 cm (13 to 15 inches) in height measured to the withers. \nThe eyes are small and dark colored and of oval shape. The nose and pads of the feet are black except in liver colored dogs where the nose and pad coloring will be liver colored.  Liver colored dogs will have a slightly lighter colored eye. The dog will not shed if properly groomed. It is suggested that \"Regular stripping and trimming improves the texture and quality of the coat\" and is \"necessary to enhance the dog's utilitarian purposes\" as well as \"enhancing him for the show ring\".\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe dogs are friendly, bold, and confident. Shyness is very atypical, as is aggressiveness. Very intelligent and independent minded, they are quick to learn and easy to train though Lakelands often exhibit 'selective deafness' when their interest level is aroused. The Lakeland is quite receptive to crate training. As with most terriers, the Lakeland is energetic; daily exercise and playtimes are a must, lest this active dog seek other outlets for their energy, with undesirable results for the owner.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe UK Kennel Club claims to have recognised Lakeland Terriers in 1921, whereas the Lakeland Terrier Club suggests this was closer to 1928. The Lakeland Terrier Association (now defunct) was founded in 1921. In 1925 the breed attained homogeneity following a cross-breeding with the Fox Terrier and the Airedale Terrier. The Lakeland Terrier Club was founded in 1932 and promoted the breed nationally through Kennel-Club sanctioned shows.\nIn the Lake District of the UK, the mountainous, rocky terrain is unsuitable for hunting fox on horseback and foxes were hunted on foot. It has been suggested that the Lakeland Terrier's great stamina derives from running all day with the hounds, unlike his close cousin, the fox terrier, who would have been carried in a saddle bag to be released only when the fox had gone to earth.As one of the earliest Terriers (Latin derivation of earth), dating from the 1700s, this \"earth\" dog is a descendant of the old English Black and Tan and Fell Terriers. The Lakeland's original service was \"going to ground\" on the farm in hunt for vermin. Its size and energy make it popular as a hunter in hard to reach places; the breed is among those eligible for competition in sanctioned Earthdog trials. \nThe working dog version of the Lakeland is often known as the Fell Terrier or Patterdale Terrier. Whereas most terrier breeds have only to bolt their quarry, or to mark it by baying, the Lakeland must be able to kill the foxes in their lair.\n\n\n== Famous Lakelands ==\nStingray of Derryabah - the first dog to win Best in Show/Supreme Champion at both the top US and UK shows Westminster and Crufts (1967)\nZelda Van Gutters - Nickelodeon Magazine's Roving Reporter/Mascot\nChampion Revelry's Awesome Blossom - Top winning Lakeland Terrier owned by Jean L.

The Lancashire Heeler is listed by the Kennel Club (UK) as a vulnerable breed.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe coat is harsh and smooth with an undercoat which keeps the dog dry in all weathers. It may have a slight mane round the neck in winter. The dog is usually black and tan, but liver and tan is now recognised by the Kennel Club. They are slightly longer than height at withers, usually measures between 10\u201312 inches (25\u201330 cm) at the shoulder and weighs 13\u201318 pounds (5.9\u20138.2 kg). Ears can be tipped or erect.\n\n\n=== Personality ===\nIt is alert, friendly, energetic, intelligent, playful and a pleasant companion. Personality can range from lazy and playful to energetic and talkative. It is actually a very strong dog that likes to participate in all kinds of activities, and can carry a ball or object the size of itself. The Lancashire Heeler is friendly towards its owners and passers-by on the street but may be aggressive towards an unknown character on their territory.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Lancashire Heeler has a life expectancy of 12\u201315 years or more. The three most common serious conditions that can affect Heelers are Collie eye anomaly, Primary lens luxation and Persistent pupillary membranes. As well as these eye conditions, dogs of this breed may suffer from Patella luxation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPrecise details of the origin of breed are unknown. However, it is accepted that a type of Welsh Corgi was used to drive livestock to the north west of England from Wales. In the Ormskirk area, a type of black and tan terrier called the Manchester Terrier was introduced which resulted in what is now known as the Lancashire Heeler. The breed has been known in its home county for over a hundred and fifty years as a general purpose farm dog, capable of both ratting and herding cattle.Gwen Mackintosh began to breed Heelers in the early 1960s. Together with other enthusiasts, she established the Lancashire Heeler Club  in 1978, with the club setting a breed standard and register. Recognition by The Kennel Club followed in 1981. Mackintosh would continue to serve as the club's president until her death in 1992.The breed was recognised as a vulnerable native breed by The Kennel Club in 2006, which means that annual registration figures are 300 or less for the breed. In 2006, 173 Heelers were registered in the UK, in 2007 this had decreased further to 146. In 2016, the FCI added the breed to the list of provisionally accepted breeds.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nLancashire Heelers can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, Rally obedience, showmanship, flyball, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Lancashire Heelers exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLancashire Heeler at Curlie"}, {"id": 300, "name": "Landseer (dog)", "country": "Canada", "type": "", "picture": "dog300", "description": "The Landseer is a dog breed. The breed is not recognized by all kennel clubs. It is not to be confused with a white and black Newfoundland, which is also often called a \"landseer\". \nThe breed was named after the British painter Sir Edwin Henry Landseer, because in 1838 he created the painting A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society, which shows a dog of this breed.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Landseer Newfoundland dog is known for its sweet disposition, gentleness, and serenity. They enjoy swimming and tend to drool, though not as much as some other giant breeds. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nDuring colonial times, large white and black \"Newfoundland dogs\" were brought to England. Because of their good swimming skills, these dogs were utilized by fishermen to tow nets to the shore. They were also noted for their ability to help drowning people; therefore, these dogs were bought and sold mainly by European fishermen. It is believed that, by and large, the exportation of these dogs occurred during the late 18th century. However, paintings show us that these dogs must have already existed in England in the early 18th century.\nBecause of their impressive appearance, they were the subject of numerous books and paintings.\nThe most famous painting of a large white and black dog of this type is a portrait called \"A Distinguished Member of Humane Society\" done by the renowned English animal painter Sir Edwin Landseer in 1838. In fact, the subject matter of many of Sir Edwin's paintings focused on these dogs. The dog portrayed in one of the most famous paintings is believed to have saved more than 20 people from drowning. It, therefore, was adopted as a member of the humane society.\n\n\n== Body ==\nMales normally weigh 65\u201380 kg (143\u2013176 lb), and females 55\u201365 kg (121\u2013143 lb), placing them in the \"Giant\" weight range; but some Newfoundland dogs have been known to weigh over 90 kg (200 lb) \u2013 and the largest on record weighed 120 kg (260 lb) and measured over 1.8 m (6 ft) from nose to tail, ranking it among the biggest Molossers.

It is the result of a female wolf-male dog hybridization that occurred post-domestication. Subclade d1 originated 480-3,000 years ago and is found in all Sami-related breeds: Finnish Lapphund, Swedish Lapphund, Lapponian Herder, Jamthund, Norwegian Elkhound and H\u00e4llefors Elkhound.

Ears are pricked (standing up; drop ears are a disqualifying fault.) Colour is generally black or dark grey or brown, with a lighter shade on the head and lower parts of the body, often with white markings. Height should be 51 cm (20 in) at the withers for males, 46 cm (18 in) for females. Males and females should look distinctly different. Weight is between 55-65 pounds, males usually heavier than females.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe breed standard states that the dog should be calm, friendly, and docile, but also energetic. Most herding breeds need to be given regular exercise. The temperament of individual dogs may vary.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe Lapponian Herder can participate in dog agility trials, carting, mushing, obedience, Rally obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Lapponian Herders exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Sami people of northern Europe used Spitz type herding dogs in managing their herds of reindeer for a very long time. Such dogs were not of modern breeds of documented heritage, and did not have a fixed appearance, but rather were a landrace type of herding dog. Although Swedish and Finnish dog fanciers began collecting information about the type in the 1930s, most of the dogs were lost as a result of World War II.\nAfter the war various breeders in Sweden and Finland began to try to recreate the lost reindeer herding dogs in their various forms. In Finland, the first was recognised as the  Kukonharjulainen (a kennel name) by the Finnish Kennel Club. The breed was a few of the herding dogs crossed with black and white Karelian Bear Dogs, resulting in a short-coated dog. Other breeders with another kennel club in Finland created another breed, this one with a more heavy coat, called the Lapponian Herder. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, more dogs were collected, and assigned to one of the two varieties based on their appearance. Around the same time the two kennel clubs merged, and all the Finnish reindeer dogs were placed in the same registry. In 1966 they were separated again, based on coat length. One breed was renamed Lapphund at that time, and the other was named Lapinporokoira (translated into English as the Lapponian Herder.)The Lapinporokoira is recognised under Finnish sponsorship as F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale breed number 284, in Group 5  Spitz and primitive types Section 3 Nordic Watchdogs and Herders. The stud book for the breed remains open. Exported to North America, it is recognised there by the United Kennel Club in the Herding Group (the United Kennel Club places the Finnish Lapphund in the Northern Breed Group.) It is also recognised by various minor kennel clubs and internet based dog registry businesses, and promoted as a rare breed for those seeking a unique pet.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFinnish Lapphund\nSwedish Lapphund\nFinnish Spitz\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 302, "name": "Leonberger", "country": "Germany", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog302", "description": "The Leonberger is a giant dog breed. The breed's name derives from the city of Leonberg in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany. According to legend, the Leonberger was ostensibly bred as a \"symbolic dog\" that would mimic the lion in the town crest. It is in the Working Group for dog shows such as Crufts, but not at the World Dog Show.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThis mountain dog occurs with a generous double coat; the Leonberger is a large, muscular, and elegant dog with balanced body type, medium temperament, and dramatic presence. The head is adorned with a striking black mask and projects the breed's distinct expression of intelligence, pride, and kindliness. Remaining true to their early roots as a capable family and working dog and search and rescue dog (particularly water), the surprisingly agile Leonberger is sound and coordinated, with both strength in bearing and elegance in movement. A sexually dimorphic breed, the Leonberger possesses either a strongly masculine or elegantly feminine form, making gender immediately discernible.\n\n\n=== Size, proportion, and substance ===\nHeight at withers:\n\nMale: 71\u201380 cm (28\u201331 in): average 75 cm (30 in) \nFemale: 65\u201375 cm (26\u201330 in): average 70 cm (28 in) Weight:\n\nMales: 120\u2013170 lb (54\u201377 kg): average 140\u2013150 lb (64\u201368 kg)\nFemales: 100\u2013135 lb (45\u201361 kg): average 115 lb (52 kg)Capable of demanding work, the Leonberger is a dog of ample substance. Its frame is supported with well-muscled, medium to heavy bone in direct proportion to its size. A roomy chest is sufficiently broad and deep for the purpose of work. Seen in profile, the chest curves inward from the prosternum, tangenitally joins at the elbow to its underline at 50% of the withers' height and then continues slightly upward toward the stifle.\n\n\n=== Head ===\nThe head is well balanced in proportion to the size of the dog and is deeper than broad with the length of muzzle and the length of skull approximately equal. With close fitting eyelids, the eyes are set into the skull upon a slight oblique; the eyes are medium-sized, almond shaped, and colored dark brown. The ears are fleshy, moderately sized, and pendant shaped, with sufficient substance to hang close to the skull and drop the tip of the ears level with the inside corners of the mouth. The Leonberger's ears rise from halfway between the eye and the top of his skull to level with the top of his skull. Though level bites and slight anomalies not affecting the robustness of the lower jaw are common, the ideal Leonberger capably possesses a strong scissor bite with full dentition.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\n\nBoth a necessity for work and a defining attribute of the breed, the Leonberger has a water-resistant double coat on his body that is complemented by the shorter, fine hair on his muzzle and limbs. The long, profuse, outer coat is durable, relatively straight, lies flat, and fits close. A mature, masculine Leonberger exhibits a pronounced mane. Similarly, his tail is very well furnished from the tip to the base where it blends harmoniously with the breech's furnishings. Climate permitting, his undercoat is soft and dense. Apart from a neatening of the feet, the Leonberger is presented untrimmed.\n\n\n=== Color ===\nA variety of coat colors are acceptable, including all combinations of lion-yellow, red, red-brown, and sand. Nose leather, foot pads and lips should always be black. Faulty colors include brown with brown nose leather, black and tan, black, white or silver and eyes without any brown. A small patch of white on the chest or toes is permitted.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nFirst and foremost a family dog, the Leonberger's temperament is one of its most important and distinguishing characteristics. Well socialized and trained, the Leonberger is self-assured, insensitive to noise, submissive to family members, friendly toward children, well composed with passersby, and self-disciplined when obliging its family or property with protection. Robust, loyal, intelligent, playful, and kindly, they can thus be taken anywhere without difficulty and adjust easily to a variety of circumstances, including the introduction of other dogs. Proper control and early socialization and training are essential, as this is a giant breed.\n\n\n== Health ==\nLeonbergers are strong, generally healthy dogs. Hip dysplasia, which devastates many large breeds, is largely controlled because of the effort of many breeders who actively screen their Leonbergers using X-rays evaluated by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals and leave dysplastic specimens out of the gene pool, thereby reducing the risk of bone/joint problems. For over 20 years, breeders belonging to the Leonberger Club of America, which issued pedigrees for the Leonberger breed in America, adhered to many aspects of the German breeding program, whereby member kennels may only choose to breed dogs that were certified as three generation free of hip dysplasia. As a likely result, the incidence of hip dysplasia in the breed was reduced to almost 10% and the occurrence of OFA-rated \"Excellent\" hips increased by over 60% in just 20 years. Current incidence rates of hip dysplasia in Leonbergers are likely around 13%. After 2010, when the Leonberger Club of America joined the American Kennel Club, the formerly strict breeding rules are no longer mandatory for all Leonbergers.\nThough not common, Leonbergers do inherit and/or develop a number of diseases that range in their impact from mild to devastating. In addition to hip dysplasia, Leonbergers can inherit and/or develop heart problems, inherited Leonberger paralysis/polyneuropathy, osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, osteochondrosis dissecans, allergies, digestive disorders, cataracts, entropion/ectropion eyelids, progressive retinal atrophy, perianal fistulas, and thyroid disorders. Though rumors persist of Leonbergers being more sensitive to anesthesia than other breeds of dog, they are largely untrue. Leonbergers, like other large breed dogs, require less dosage per pound of sedative than smaller breeds to yield the same effect. The Leonberger Health Foundation, a private nonprofit foundation whose sole mission is to support major researchers who are seeking to identify genetic markers for serious diseases which affect the breed, is currently focusing on osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, and Leonberger polyneuropathy.\n\n\n=== Longevity ===\nLeonbergers in UK and USA/Canada surveys had a median lifespan around 7 years, which is about 4 years less than the average purebred dog, but typical of similarly sized breeds. About 20% of Leonbergers in the surveys lived to 10 years or more. The oldest dogs in both surveys died at about 13. In France, the breed has a median lifespan of 8.75 years.Serious diseases can affect the Leonberger\u2014certain types of cancers are very common in the breed. Gastric dilatation volvulus, commonly called bloat, is another serious condition that affects many of the large- and giant-breed dogs, particularly those with deep chests. It causes the stomach to twist and can be fatal quite quickly. Adult Leonbergers should always be fed twice a day rather than one large meal to reduce the likelihood of bloat. Leonbergers are not alone in inheriting serious diseases, and according to the University of Sydney's LIDA taskforce, Leonbergers have relatively few health issues compared to other dog breeds.In a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (45%), cardiac disease (11%), and \"unknown\" (8.5%). In a 2000 USA/Canada Leonberger Club of America survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (37%), old age (12%), cardiac disease (9%), and \"sudden death\" (8%).Studies have indicated problems with inherited polyneuropathy in certain populations of Leonbergers and cataracts in dogs in the United Kingdom. A study of \"Leonberger polyneuropathy\" was published in 2014. Genetic testing is to be done through a protocol administered in North America by the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. or Institute of Genetics, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 1830s, Heinrich Essig, a dog breeder and seller and mayor of the town of Leonberg near Stuttgart in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany, claimed to have created the Leonberger by crossing a female Landseer Newfoundland with a \"barry\" male from the Great St. Bernard Hospice and Monastery (which would later create the Saint Bernard breed). Later, according to Essig, a Pyrenean Mountain Dog was added, resulting in very large dogs with the long, white coats that were the fashion for the time, and pleasant temperament. The first dogs registered as Leonbergers were born in 1846 and had many of the prized qualities of the breeds from which they were derived. The popular legend is that it was bred to resemble the coat-of-arms animal of Leonberg, the lion. The Leonberger dog became popular with several European royal households, including Napoleon II, Empress Elisabeth of Austria, the Prince of Wales, Otto Von Bismarck, Emperor Napoleon III, and Umberto I of Italy. Essig's claim of breeding the dog as described is disputed. Records from as early as 1585 may indicate the existence of Leonberger-type dogs; documents dating from 1601 held by the Metternich family describe similar dogs used to deter the theft of livestock.  Either way,  no doubt exists that Essig named and registered the breed first. A black-and-white engraving of the Leonberger was included in The Illustrated Book of the Dog by Vero Shaw (at p. 488) in 1881.  At the time, Essig's Leonbergers were denounced as an indifferent knockoff of a St. Bernard\u2014not a stable and recognized breed\u2014and a product of a popular fad or fashion for large and strong dogs, fomented in part by Essig's prodigious marketing skills (he gave dogs to the rich and famous).The modern look of the Leonberger, with darker coats and a black masks, was developed during the latter part of the 20th century by reintroducing other breeds, such as the Newfoundland. This was necessary because breeding stocks of the Leonberger were seriously affected by the two world wars. During World War I, most Leonbergers were left to fend for themselves as breeders fled or were killed. Reportedly, only five Leonbergers survived World War I and were bred until World War II when, again, almost all Leonbergers were lost. During the two world wars, Leonbergers were used to pull the ammunition carts, a service to the breed's country that resulted in the Leonbergers' near-destruction. Leonbergers today can have their ancestry traced to the eight dogs that survived World War II.Traditionally, Leonbergers were kept as farm dogs and were much praised for their abilities in watch and draft work. They were frequently seen pulling carts around the villages of Bavaria and surrounding districts. Around the beginning of the 20th century, Leonbergers were imported by the government of Canada for use as water rescue/lifesaving dogs. The breed continues in that role today, along with the Newfoundland, Labrador Retriever, and Golden Retriever dogs; they are used at the Italian School of Canine Lifeguard.  They have been used successfully as flock guard dogs.The Leonberger received American Kennel Club recognition as a member of the Working Group on January 1, 2010, alongside the Icelandic Sheepdog and the Cane Corso. It was the 167th breed to be recognized by the AKC.\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nThree Leonberger dogs (one was a female, and two males) played the main character Buck in The Call of the Wild: Dog of the Yukon (1997), a Canadian rendition of Jack London's The Call of the Wild which stars Rutger Hauer as John Thornton and is narrated by Richard Dreyfuss. The breed chosen in this movie was not the one identified as Buck in the novel.\nIn The Equalizer, Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) visits his former CIA co-workers at their large Virginia home which has two Leonbergers.\nThe breed has been featured on stamps from many countries.The Lifetime TV movie Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever features a Leonberger that becomes a victim of a kidnapping.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"The Leonberger: A special supplement\".

It was bred as an interior sentinel in the Buddhist monasteries, to alert the monks to any intruders who entered. Lhasa is the capital city of Tibet, and apso is a word in the Tibetan language meaning \"bearded\", so, Lhasa Apso simply means \"long-haired Lhasa dog\". There are, however, some who claim that the word \"apso\" is a form of the Tibetan word \"rapso\", meaning \"goat-like\", which would make the equivalent translation \"woolly Lhasa dog\".\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nMale Lhasa Apsos should ideally be 10.75 inches (27.3 cm) at the withers and weigh about 14 to 18 pounds (6.4 to 8.2 kg). The females are slightly smaller, and weigh between 12 to 14 pounds (5.4 to 6.4 kg). The breed standard requires dark brown eyes and a black nose, although liver-colored Lhasas have a brown nose. The texture of the coat is heavy, straight, hard, neither woolly nor silky, and very dense. They come in a wide variety of colors including black, white, red and gold with various shadings.  Lhasas can be with or without dark tips at the ends of ears and beard. The tail should be carried well over the dog's back. The breed standard currently used by the American Kennel Club was approved on July 11, 1978.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nHaving been bred as an indoor monastery-sentinel dog by Tibetan Buddhist monks, Lhasa Apsos are alert with a keen sense of hearing. The ideal Lhasa temperament is to be wary of strangers while being loyal to those closest to them. Left untrained, they can be very aggressive to strangers. They rank 68th (out of 79) in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of fair working-obedience intelligence.Lhasa Apsos are independent as well as very loyal and eager-to-please dogs, yet they may be suspicious toward strangers.  While Lhasa Apsos show loyalty to their owners, they will let their masters know when they don't want to do something. They will lie flat without moving, \"put on the brakes\" and refuse to walk forward, or try to back away.  Time and patience will build the trust between the Lhasa and owner.A Lhasa Apso responds to exercise and discipline with a calm assertive energy. These dogs require early socialization with dogs and other people as puppies and throughout their lives. Because Lhasa Apsos are an independent and intelligent breed, house training puppies requires consistency. They require patience and may be slow to house train, but in return, they can be quite comical, entertaining and caring companions. They aim to please their owners and enjoy training. While their personality belies their size, they need a home that is mindful that there is a small dog in the house to prevent injury. They enjoy vantage points in the house where they can view all that is going on.\nThe Lhasa Apso is a long-lived breed, with many living in good health into their early 20s. The average age for these dogs is 12\u201314. There are few health problems specific to the breed. Their vision may deteriorate with age, but they are not sight-oriented dogs and they endure blindness with few noticeable changes in behavior.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Lhasa Apso originated on the Himalayan plateau in the area of Tibet. They were domesticated and actively bred perhaps as long ago as 800 BC, which makes the Lhasa Apso one of the oldest recognized breeds in the world. Recent research has shown the Lhasa as one of the breeds most closely related to the ancestral wolf. (Others are Akita, Shiba Inu, Shar-Pei, Chow, Basenji, Alaskan Malamute, Siberian Husky, Saluki, Afghan, Pekingese, Shih Tzu, and Samoyed.)Referred to in Tibet as Apso Seng Kyi, which can be translated as \"Bearded Lion Dog\", the Lhasa's primary function was that of a household sentinel, guarding the homes of Tibetan nobility and Buddhist monasteries, particularly in or near the sacred city of Lhasa. The large Tibetan Mastiffs guarded the monasteries' entrances, but the keen hearing and sharp bark of the Lhasa Apso served to warn residents by acting like a burglar alarm if an intruder happened to get past the exterior guards.\nIt was believed that the bodies of the Lhasa Apsos could be entered by souls of deceased lamas while they awaited rebirth into a new body. Lhasas in Tibet were never sold. The only way a person could get one was as a gift.\n\nIn the early 1900s, a few of the breed were brought by military men returning from the Indian subcontinent to England, where the breed was referred to as the \"Lhasa Terrier\".The original American pair of Lhasas was a gift from Thubten Gyatso, 13th Dalai Lama to C. Suydam Cutting, arriving in the United States in 1933. Mr. Cutting had traveled in Tibet and met the Dalai Lama there. At this time, there was only one Lhasa Apso registered in England. The breed was at first called the Lhasa Terrier, later the Lhasa Apso. The American Kennel Club officially accepted the breed in 1935 in the Terrier Group, and in 1959 transferred the breed to the Non-Sporting Group. In the UK, they are placed in the Utility Group.\nCertain characteristics which are part of the breed type evolved as a result of geographical and climatic environment \u2014 the high altitudes, the dry windy climate, the dusty terrain, the short hot summer and the long bitterly cold winter of the Himalaya region. Among these are head features, the coat, eye-fall, the musculation and body structure, the general hardiness and longevity of the breed.DNA Analysis has identified the Lhasa Apso as one of the 14 most ancient dog breeds, verifying that lap dogs and companion dogs were among the first dogs bred by humans.Today, in the USA, there exists a unique group of Lhasa Apsos known within the fancy as the Gompa dogs. (Gompa is the Tibetan word for a monastery\u2019s main meditation hall.) These Lhasa Apsos are direct descendants of the Lhasa Apsos from the Drepung monastery in Tibet, where, in 1941, Lama Gyen Yeshe was gifted Preserving the Future, Enlisting the Past his first Lhasa Apso by a High Reincarnate Lama. In the 1980s, nine Lhasa Apsos bred by the late Lama Gyen Yeshe or sired by one of his dogs were brought into Canada. Bred together for a number of years, descendants were eventually registered with the United Kennel Club (UKC). In 2000, the remaining descendants entered the United States as part of a successful rescue. Since then, organized efforts have been made to maintain the dogs and preserve the line. The Gompa Lhasa Apso Preservation Program (GLAPP), a 501(c)3 organization, is a small population genetics management program perpetuating the genetic lineage of the Gompa Lhasa Apso. Not having undergone selection to a written standard, this unique gene pool represents the Lhasa Apso as it developed as a landrace. GLAPP\u2019s internal database contains records of all dogs being used to perpetuate this genetic lineage and includes DNA Profiling, DNA Parentage Verification and microchip identification. Dogs born within the Preservation Program continue to be registered with UKC.  In August 2011, seventeen dogs from the Gompa Lhasa Apso Preservation Program entered the American Kennel Club (AKC) studbook. The goal of recording recently imported region-of-origin Lhasa Apsos is to increase genetic diversity while maintaining the integrity of the AKC studbook.\n\n\n== Shedding ==\n\nLike most mammals, all dogs slough off dander, or flake dead skin. Since dander and many other allergens become trapped in hair, the susceptibility of allergies acting up is dependent of the amount of hair shed and the weight of the hair.  As the amount of hair shed increases, and the weight of the hair decreases, the probability of airborne hair, dander and allergens increases.  This will, therefore, increase one's allergies to a particular animal.  Lhasas have long coarse hair, which causes the weight of the hair to be heavy.  Due to the long length of hair, Lhasa Apsos do not shed hair the same way as other breeds.  Instead, they shed hair like humans, slowly and continuously, as to keep their hygiene clean and risk of matting and tangling low.   The long, heavy hair prevents individual hair strands to become airborne, and decreases the amount of dander in the air as compared to other breeds. People with allergies may co-exist with the low-shedding breeds of dogs, like the Lhasa Apso.\nComing from the extremely cold weather of the Himalayas, the Lhasa has a double coat:  an under coat to keep them warm and an outer coat consisting of guard hairs for protection and aiding to keep their coat flat and smooth. The outer coat consisting of the guard hair should be similar to human hair; one should be able to feel individual hair strands when touched.  While the undercoat is softer and finer, it should lay flat and blend in with the outer coat.  \nRoutine brushing and bathing is necessary, not only to keep up on the slow continuous shedding, but also to remove any dirt and debris that may get caught within the hair strands.  A Lhasa with a thick coarse outer coat will likely require less grooming than a Lhasa with a lot of under coat and soft, less coarse, top coat.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThe Lhasa Apso is prone to a few health problems, but still a very healthy breed. For example, it is susceptible to sebaceous adenitis, a hereditary skin disease that occurs primarily in Standard Poodles, but has also been reported in a number of other breeds, including the Lhasa Apso. They are also prone to the genetic disease progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) which can render them blind.  Responsible breeders have their breeding dogs checked yearly by a canine ophthalmologist to check that they are not developing the disease, which is heritable in offspring. Lhasa Apsos are also prone to eye diseases, such as cherry eye and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS or dry eye syndrome). A 2004 Kennel Club survey puts the median lifespan of the breed at 14 years 4 months. UK vet clinic data puts the median at 13.0 years.While regarded by many as a \"lap dog\", Lhasa Apsos do require daily exercise, by play and walks, to maintain physical health and mental well being.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn the animated series Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends, Angelica Jones/Firestar owns a Lhasa Apso named Ms. Lion.\nIn the television series The L Word, Helena is assured by her wealthy mother that she was going to leave her inheritance to her, not to her Lhasa Apsos.\nLhasa Apsos are said to bring luck, hence the saying \"Lucky Lhasa\".\nSinger Arturo Paz owns a Lhasa Apso named Coco.\nActress/Singer-Songwriter Keke Palmer has a Lhasa Apso named Rust.\nA Lhasa Apso is both a major character and a plot device in the 1948 children's novel Daughter of the Mountains by Louise Rankin.\nIn the Flash animation series Princess,  a Lhasa Apso plays the titular character.\nGospel artist Gerald Wolfe has a Lhasa Apso named Wookie.\nDougal in The Magic Roundabout is a Lhasa Apso.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLhasa Apso at Curlie\n Media related to Lhasa Apso at Wikimedia Commons"}, {"id": 304, "name": "Lithuanian Hound", "country": "Lithuania", "type": "", "picture": "dog304", "description": "The Lithuanian Hound (Lithuanian: Lietuvi\u0173 skalikas) is a rare, medium-size hunting dog from Lithuania. It is sturdy and heavy-boned, but at the same time sleek and muscular. It has a short black coat with some brown on snout, chest, ears, forehead. The official standard allows for a small white spot on the chest, but not on toes. The dog's long tail is naturally low. The head is large, chest is broad, deep and low. Ears are long with rounded tips, and hang close to the cheeks. Neck is quite long and strong with no dewlap. The feet are strong and round, with compact toes, helping it be a fast, very agile, and determined pursuer.The Lithuanian Hound has been traditionally used to hunt hare, fox, and boar. The breed is mentioned in the Statutes of Lithuania (16th century). It is believed that it comes from the mixing of bloodhounds with several other hound breeds. Once a popular breed in Lithuania, the population decreased to 78 individuals after World War II. Thanks to several enthusiasts, the hound was revived, standardized, and the number of registered and documented dogs reached around 350 in 1987. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the breed decreased to around 150 individuals by 1998. The decrease in popularity is explained by changing hunting habits: the Lithuanian Hound is best suited for hunting large animals in large open areas, but modern hunting plots are decreasing in size. The Lithuanian Cynological Society plans to register the breed with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI).\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 305, "name": "L\u00f6wchen", "country": "Germany, France, Netherlands, Spain", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog305", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 306, "name": "Mackenzie River Husky", "country": "Canada, Alaska", "type": "", "picture": "dog306", "description": "The term Mackenzie River husky describes several overlapping local populations of arctic and subarctic sleddog type dogs, none of which constitutes a breed.

Whether the Mahratta is a descendant of the Saluki or a localization of other indigenous Indian sighthounds remains the essential question.

It is a medium-sized dog with black fur or black with white markings on its chest.  It comes in both shorthaired and longhaired varieties.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince ancient times it was used as shepherd dog for all cattle, even bird, and as a guard and defense in the houses of possession. While the timing of its arrival is unknown, some assumptions suggest that came either with the conquest of King James I of Aragon or shortly thereafter, and over the centuries the Majorcan shepherds and foravilers conferred it very own and distinct features not only from other islanders dogs, but also its neighbors around the Mediterranean.\nIn the 1970s was begun its selection and controlled breeding, and already in 1980 was drafted the standard to determine the characteristics and to have a valid reference to both the valuation and advice for reproduction, billboards carried out by the Club of \"Ca de Bestiar\" and that has been a cornerstone for its recovery. This racial prototype was accepted by the RSCPFRCE (Royal Central Society for the Promotion of Dog Breeds of Spain) and also recognized by the top world body: the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) on 13 September, 1982 with num. 321 classifying it as Group 1.

Most of the breed is short-haired, about 1.5 to 3 cm long on the back, with a very fine, thin undercoat. In the long haired variety, the hair is slightly wavy on the back and can reach  over 7 cm in length in the winter. In the long-haired variety the undercoat is well distributed and not thick, showing varying shades of black.  The ears, which are slightly bent from the side, are relatively small, triangular, thick and set high on the head.  The color of the fur is described by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale as follows: \"The only acceptable color is black in the shades jet, normal and pitch black.

Temperamentally they are protective, potentially aggressive, and courageous.  Although it is unusual for a black dog to tolerate heat well, the Majorca Shepherd Dog can tolerate the high temperatures of the Mediterranean climate, and they have been exported to Brazil where they have been successfully used to protect private property.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"The Story of the Modern Ca de Bestiar\""}, {"id": 311, "name": "Maltese (dog)", "country": "Italy", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog311", "description": "The Maltese (Italian: [mal\u02c8te\u02d0ze]), Canis familiaris Maelitacus, is a small breed of dog in the Toy Group. It descends from dogs originating in the Central Mediterranean Area. The breed name and origins are generally understood to derive from the Mediterranean island nation of Malta.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis ancient breed has been known by a variety of names throughout the centuries. It has also been known in English as the \"ancient dog of Malta,\" the \"Roman Ladies' Dog,\" the \"Maltese Sleeve Dog,\" and \"Melita\" (the former name of Malta). The origin of the common name \"Cokie\" is unknown, but is believed to have originated in the mid-1960s on the U.S. East Coast and spread in popular use. This breed has been referred to falsely as the \"Bichon\", a name that refers to the family (\"small long-haired dog\") and not the breed. The Kennel Club officially settled on the name \"Maltese\" for the breed in the 19th century.The Maltese is thought to have been descended from a Spitz-type dog found among the Swiss Lake Dwellers and was selectively bred to attain its small size. There is also some evidence that the breed originated in Asia and is related to the Tibetan Terrier; however, the exact origin is unknown. The dogs probably made their way to Europe through the Middle East with the migration of nomadic tribes. Some writers believe these proto-Maltese were used for rodent control before the appearance of the breed gained paramount importance.\nThe oldest record of this breed was found on a Greek amphora found in the Etruscan town of Vulci, in which a Maltese-like dog is portrayed along with the word \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03b5 (Melitaie). Archaeologists date this ancient Athenian product to the decades around 500 BC.  References to the dog can also be found in Ancient Greek and Roman literature.Aristotle was the first to mention its name Melitaei Catelli, when he compares the dog to a mustelid, around 370 BC. The first written document (supported by Stephanus of Byzantium) describing the small Canis Melitaeus was given by the Greek writer Callimachus, around 350 BC. Pliny suggests the dog as having taken its name from the Adriatic island M\u00e9l\u00e9da; however, Strabo, in the early first century AD, identifies the breed as originating from the Mediterranean island of Malta, and writes that they were favored by noble women.During the first century, the Roman poet Martial wrote descriptive verses to a small white dog named Issa owned by his friend Publius. It is commonly thought that Issa was a Maltese dog, and various sources link Martial's friend Publius with the Roman Governor Publius of Malta, though others do not identify him.John Caius, physician to Queen Elizabeth I, also claimed that Callimachus was referring to the island of Melita \"in the Sicilian strait\" (Malta). This claim is often repeated, especially by English writers. The dog's links to Malta are mentioned in the writings of Abb\u00e9 Jean Quintin d'Autun, Secretary to the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, in his work Insulae Melitae Descriptio.Around the 17th and 18th centuries, some breeders decided to \"improve\" the breed, by making it smaller still.  Linnaeus wrote in 1792 that these dogs were about the size of a squirrel. The breed nearly disappeared and was crossbred with other small dogs such as Poodles and miniature Spaniels. In the early 19th century, there were as many as nine different breeds of Maltese dog.Parti-colour and solid colour dogs were accepted in the show ring from 1902 until 1913 in England, and as late as 1950 in Victoria, Australia. However, white Maltese were required to be pure white. Coloured Maltese could be obtained from the south of France.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Maltese had been recognized as a FCI breed under the patronage of Italy in 1954, at the annual meeting in Interlaken, Switzerland. The current FCI standard is dated November 27, 1989, and the latest translation from Italian to English is dated April 6, 1998. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1888, its latest standard being from March 10, 1964.\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nCharacteristics include slightly rounded skulls, with a finger-wide dome, a black button nose and brown eyes. They usually grow up to be about 7-10 inches tall. The body is compact with the length equaling the height and the tail is almost always curled. The drop ears with (sometimes) long hair, and surrounded by darker skin pigmentation (called a \"halo\"), gives Maltese their expressive look. Lacking exposure to a lot sunlight, their noses can fade and become pink or light brown in color. This is often referred to as a \"winter nose\" and many times will become black again with increased exposure to the sun. The Maltese's paws are very sensitive to touch.\n\n\n==== Coat and color ====\nThe coat is long and silky and lacks an undercoat. Some Maltese can have curly hair (especially behind their ears), but this is considered a fault. The colour of the coat is pure white. A pale ivory tinge is permitted on the ears. In some standards, a pure white coat with slight lemon markings is tolerated.The Maltese does not shed, and is therefore a good choice for people with dog allergies. Some people prefer their dogs to have the coat short. The most common cut for the Maltese is called \"the puppy cut,\" which involves trimming or shaving the entire body (skirt, legs/paws, chest, and head fur) to one short length (typically less than an inch long).\n\n\n==== Size ====\nAdult Maltese range from roughly 3 to 10 lb (1.4 to 4.5 kg), though breed standards, as a whole, call for weights between 5-8 lbs. There are variations depending on which standard is being used. The American Kennel Club calls for a weight between 4 to 7 lb (1.8 to 3.2 kg), with 4 to 6 lb (1.8 to 2.7 kg) preferred, while the FCI standard popular in Europe prefers a heavier Maltese between 3 to 4 kg (6.6 to 8.8 lb). They stand normally 7 to 12 in (18 to 30 cm).\n\n\n=== Gait ===\nAs per the AKC standard: The Maltese moves with a jaunty, smooth, flowing gait. Viewed from the side, they give an impression of rapid movement, size considered. In the stride, the forelegs reach straight and free from the shoulders, with elbows close. Hind legs to move in a straight line. Cowhocks or any suggestion of hind leg toeing in or out are faults.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nMaltese are bred to be companion dogs. They are extremely lively and playful, and even as a Maltese ages, its energy level and playful demeanor remain fairly constant. Some Maltese may occasionally be snappish with smaller children and should be supervised when playing, although socializing them at a young age will reduce this habit. They also adore humans, and prefer to stay near them. The Maltese is very active within a house, and, preferring enclosed spaces, does very well with small yards. For this reason, the breed also fares well in apartments and townhouses, and is a prized pet of urban dwellers. Some Maltese may suffer from separation anxiety.An Australia-wide (not including Tasmania) research project carried out in conjunction with RSPCA found owners likely to dump their Maltese, citing the tendency of Maltese to bark constantly. This breed is Australia's most dumped dog. In addition, figures released in 2010 by the Korean National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service show that some 1,208 Maltese were abandoned between January and August 2010, making it the most abandoned breed in Seoul, South Korea.\n\n\n== Care ==\n\nMaltese have no undercoat, and have little to no shedding if cared for properly. Like their relatives, the Poodles and Bichon Fris\u00e9, they are considered to be largely hypoallergenic and many people who are allergic to dogs may not be allergic to the Maltese. Daily cleaning is required to prevent the risk of tear-staining. Many owners find that a weekly bath is sufficient for keeping the coat clean, although it is recommended to not wash a dog so often, so washing every three weeks is sufficient, although if the dog keeps clean even longer than that. They need to be professionally groomed about once every month and a half.Regular grooming is also required to prevent the coats of non-shedding dogs from matting. Many owners will keep their Maltese clipped in a \"puppy cut\", a 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135 cm) all over trim that makes the dog resemble a puppy. Some owners, especially those who show Maltese in the sport of conformation, prefer to wrap the long fur to keep it from matting and breaking off, and then to show the dog with the hair unwrapped combed out to its full length. Some Maltese need to be blow-dried in order to prevent mats because drying is ineffective to some dogs.\n\nMaltese dogs can exhibit signs of tear staining underneath the eyes. Dark staining in the hair around the eyes (\"tear staining\") can be a problem in this breed, and is mostly a function of how much the individual dog's eyes water and the size of the tear ducts. To get rid of tear staining, a solution or powder can be specially made for tear stains, which can often be found in local pet stores. A fine-toothed metal pet comb, moistened with hot water and applied perhaps twice weekly, also works extremely well. The antibiotic Cephalexin has been shown to completely clear up \"tear staining\" in some cases. Maltese are susceptible to \"reverse sneezing\", which sounds like a honking, snorting or gagging sound and results often from over-excitement, play, allergies, or upon waking up.  It is not life-threatening or dangerous\u2014it will go away after about a minute.\n\n\n=== Intellect ===\nThey are ranked 59th out of 79 in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, which indexes obedience and the ability of a dog breed to follow commands, with very light focus on skills seen outside of working breeds, such as emotional intelligence.\n\n\n=== Teething problems ===\nMaltese tend to have many or several tooth problems usually resulting in cavities, without proper care the infected teeth may fall out as the dog gets older. Maltese might need additional care and have their teeth brushed with a soft-bristled toothbrush and special dog toothpaste every week to avoid tooth problems.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCompanion dog\nCompanion Dog Group\nHavanese dog\nLap dog\nToy dog\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBusuttil, J.

It was first bred in the 19th century to control vermin, notably rats, at which it excelled. So efficient at the task was it that it often appeared in rat-baiting pits until that sport, which had effectively been illegal in the UK since 1835, finally died out at the beginning of the 20th century.\nThe breed is generally healthy, although dogs can be affected by several inheritable genetic disorders. A crash in the number of registered Manchester Terriers following the Second World War has resulted in the Kennel Club categorising it as a vulnerable native breed, in danger of extinction.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Manchester Terrier closely resembles the Black and Tan Terrier, the oldest known breed of terrier, from which it was developed. Writing in the early 16th century, John Caius describes a Manchester-terrier type of dog in De Banibus Britannicis, and at the beginning of the 19th century Sydenham Edwards described what he called a Manchester Terrier in his Cynographia Britannica.The Black and Tan Terrier had an almost legendary status as a rat killer, an ability that was much prized in overcrowded and rat-infested cities such as 19th-century Manchester. The sport of rat baiting, in which a terrier was thrown into an enclosure filled with rats, and timed to see how long it took the dog to kill them all, had become popular by the early 19th century along with rabbit coursing. In an effort to produce a dog that could excel at both sports, the breeder John Hulme decided to cross a Black and Tan Terrier with a Whippet. Similar dogs were bred in various other parts of England, but by 1860 Manchester had become the breed centre for these new terriers, and so they became known as Manchester Terriers. Other breeds, including the Italian Greyhound and the Dachshund, may also have been introduced into the bloodline.The Manchester Terrier gained the nickname of the Gentleman's Terrier in Victorian times, because of its dignified demeanour.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nBy the early 19th century a closer facsimile to the current Manchester terrier had evolved. In The Dog in Health and Disease by J. A. Walsh, a full chapter was devoted to the black and tan, for the first time recognising it as an established breed. The description given by Walsh is still relevant: Smooth haired, long tapering nose, narrow flat skull, eyes small and bright, chest rather deep than wide, only true colour black and tan.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nSome terrier breeds have a reputation for being \"stoic and dour\", but such terms do not apply to the intelligent and inquisitive Manchester Terrier, who is as \"feisty and affectionate\" as he is \"courageous and tough\", and makes a \"loyal, eager-to-please\" companion.  The American Temperament Test Society reports a test pass rate of 87.1 per cent for Manchester Terriers; the average pass rate for all breeds is 80.4 per cent.\n\n\n== Varieties ==\nThe Canadian and American Kennel Clubs recognise two varieties of Manchester Terrier, the original and a miniaturised variant, the Toy Manchester Terrier. The latter was recognised as a separate breed by the American Kennel Club in 1938, and is still considered to be a separate breed by the British Kennel Club, the English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan).  Where the Manchester Terrier may have button ears, erect ears, or cropped ears, the Toy Manchester Terrier only has erect years. Other than the size difference and ear type, the Manchester Terrier and the Toy Manchester Terrier have the same overall appearance. Since 1958 the American Kennel Club has considered both to be varieties of the same breed.\n\n\n== Health ==\nAccording to the Kennel Club's Purebred Health Survey, carried out in 2004, the Manchester Terrier has a median lifespan of around 12 years 10 months. Slightly more than 31 per cent of the animals whose deaths were reported in the survey died of old age. There are some recognised health problems in the breed associated with inheritable genetic mutations.\n\n\n=== Secondary glaucoma ===\nGlaucoma is a fairly common genetic condition in several breeds of terrier, including the Manchester Terrier. Secondary glaucoma, also known as lens luxation, is caused by excessive pressure within the eyeball forcing the lens of the eye out of alignment. The only effective treatment for this condition is surgical removal of the lens.\n\n\n=== Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome ===\nAlso known as cutaneous aesthenia, Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome is a group of connective tissue disorders caused by a mutation in one of a number of different genes. Signs of the condition include excessive elasticity of the skin, thinness of the skin and a corresponding propensity to be cut easily.\n\n\n=== Von Willebrands disease ===\nVon Willebrands disease is a blood-clotting disorder that affects humans and several breeds of dog, including the Manchester Terrier. The genetic mutation occurs in both the standard and toy varieties, but is seen more commonly in the toy. In the Manchester Terrier the gene is autosomal recessive, meaning that for any offspring to be affected the faulty gene must be carried by both parents. Affected dogs are prone to nose bleeds and bleeding from the gums. DNA tests are available to check for the condition, and the Kennel Club maintains a register of the results of those tests, allowing breeders to avoid breeding from affected dogs.\n\n\n== Extinction concerns ==\nAt the end of the Second World War in 1945 there were only eleven Manchester Terriers registered with the Kennel Club, but thanks to the efforts of the British Manchester Terrier Club, formed in 1937, and others, the breed was saved from extinction. The Kennel Club has nevertheless classified the Manchester Terrier as a vulnerable native breed. Between 2010 and 2016, the last year for which data is available, an average of 164 births per year were registered.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nAmerican Manchester Terrier Club\nManchester Terrier at Curlie"}, {"id": 313, "name": "Maremma Sheepdog", "country": "Italy", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog313", "description": "The  Maremma Sheepdog or Maremmano-Abruzzese Sheepdog (Italian: Cane da pastore Maremmano-Abruzzese), usually referred to simply as the Maremmano or Abruzzese Sheepdog, is a breed of livestock guardian dog indigenous to central Italy, particularly to Abruzzo and the Maremma region of Tuscany and Lazio. It has been used for centuries by Italian shepherds to guard sheep from wolves. The literal English translation of the name is \"The dog of the shepherds of the Maremma and Abruzzese region\". The English name of the breed derives from that of the Maremma marshlands, where, until recently, shepherds, dogs and hundreds of thousands of sheep over-wintered, and where the breed is today abundant although sheep-farming has decreased substantially.  The breed is widely employed in Abruzzo, where sheep herding remains vital to the rural economy and the wolf remains an active and protected predator. Similar breeds include the Pyrenean Mountain Dog, the Kuvasz of Hungary, the Tatra of Poland, the Cuvac of Slovakia and the \u0160arplaninac (although not white), with all of which it may share a common ancestor; and the Akbash Dog of Turkey.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient history and iconography ===\nDescriptions of white sheep defense dogs are found in ancient Roman literature, in works such as those of Columella, Varro and Palladius. Similar dogs are depicted in numerous sculptures and paintings from Roman times to the present. Among the earliest is the series of large statues (two in Rome, one in Florence, one \u2013 the Duncombe Dog \u2013 in England) copied from a Hellenistic bronze from Pergamon.\nIconographic sources that have been identified as relevant to the history of the Maremmano include:\nA Hellenistic bas-relief, of which a drawing was published by Max von Stephanitz in 1901\nA votive statuette in the Museo Archeologico of Capua\nA 14th-century mediaeval fresco in the church of San Francesco in Amatrice, at the foot of the Monti della Laga, in the comune of Rieti; the dog wears a roccale\nA 14th-century fresco in Santa Maria Novella, in Florence\nA 'Nativity' of Mariotto di Nardo (active 1394\u20131424); the dog wears a spiked collar\nAbraham and Lot on their way into Canaan by Bartolo Battiloro, in the Collegiata of San Gimignano\nA detail of the Journey of the Magi to Bethlehem by Benozzo Gozzoli, c.1460\nRough ink drawings on the maps of the pasture-lands of the Tavoliere di Foggia published in 1686 by Antonio and Nunzio Michele di Rovere\nA seventeenth-century engraving of the Roman campagna by Joannes van den Hecke\nAn eighteenth-century maiolica of a bear-hunt by Candeloro Cappelletti (1689\u20131772) of Castelli, Abruzzo\nHunting the Wolf by Jean-Baptiste Oudry, 1746, from the collection of Louis XV; the dogs to the left and right of the wolf are described in a catalogue of the museum as \"large dog[s] with long hair\".

They were used by Fran\u00e7ois Antoine, \"Antoine de Beauterne\", in his successful hunt for the Beast of G\u00e9vaudan in 1765; according to Gobin, under Louis XV (r.1715\u20131774) the Venerie Royale or Royal Hunt was composed in large part of Abruzzese wolf-dogs and Sicilian mastiffs.\nThe cane da lupo or wolf-dog used by Vincenzo Dandolo to defend Spanish sheep on the mountains above Varese\nAn illustration in the Penny Magazine of 1833\nAn engraving by Arthur John Strutt of a shepherd and his dog in the Roman campagna in 1843\nSeveral engravings by Charles Coleman in his collection A Series of Subjects peculiar to the Campagna of Rome and Pontine Marshes\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\n\nThe first registration of the Maremmano in the Libro delle Origini Italiano of the Kennel Club Italiano, as it was then called, was of four dogs in 1898. There were no further registrations for many years. In 1940 there were 17 dogs registered. The first standard for the breed was drawn up in 1924 by Luigi Groppi and Giuseppe Solaro.Until 1958 the Pastore Maremmano, or shepherd dog of the Maremma, and the Pastore Abruzzese, or shepherd dog of the Abruzzi, were regarded as separate breeds. A breeder's society for the Pastore Abruzzese was formed in 1950, and one for the Maremmano in 1953. On 1 January 1958 the breeds were unified by the ENCI, the Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia Italiano, the national dog association of Italy. The explanation given is that a \"natural fusion\" of the two types had occurred as a result of movement of the dogs due to transhumance of sheep flocks from one region to another, particularly after the unification of Italy. Until 1860, the mountains of the Abruzzo and the plains of the Maremma lay in different countries.\nAs sheep farming developed into an annual trek or transhumance from mountain grasslands of Abruzzo and Molise (and other parts of central Italy) south to lower pasture land in Puglia where sheep were over-wintered, the dogs came to play a central role in the centuries-old migration, an annual event vital to Abruzzese culture. Maremmano dogs continue to be widely used by Italian sheep farmers in areas where predation is common, such as the Apennines of central Italy and the open range land of national parks in Abruzzo. Besides their wide use in Italy, Maremma Sheepdogs are extensively used as livestock guardian dogs in Australia, Canada and the United States.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nThe Maremmano has a solid, muscular build, a thick white coat, a large head and a black nose. According to the breed standard, males should weigh 35 to 45 kilograms (77 to 99 lb) and stand 65 to 73 centimetres (26 to 29 in) at the shoulder, while females weigh 30 to 40 kilograms (66 to 88 lb) and stand 60 to 68 centimetres (24 to 27 in). Some dogs may be considerably larger. The coat is long and thick; it is rough to the touch, and forms a thick collar around the neck. It should be solid white; some minor yellowing may be tolerated.\nSome divide the breed into various subtypes, largely based on small differences in physical attributes and with subtype names based on village and provincial names where the dogs may be found, e.g. the Maremmano, the Marsicano, the Aquilano, the Pescocostanzo, the Maiella, and the Peligno. However, biologists dispute this division, as well as over reliance on minor physical differences, as the dogs were bred over the centuries for their behavioral characteristics as flock guardians.\n\n\n== Use ==\nThe traditional use of the Maremma sheepdog is as a guardian for the protection of sheep flocks against wolves. Columella, writing in the first century AD, recommends white dogs for this purpose, as the shepherd can easily distinguish them from the wolf, while Varro suggests that white dogs have a \"lion-like aspect\" in the dark. The dogs work in groups; three or four dogs are an adequate defense against wolves and stray dogs. Their function is mostly one of dissuasion, actual physical combat with the predator being relatively rare. Nevertheless, working dogs may be fitted with a roccale (or vreccale), a spiked iron collar which protects the neck in combat. The ears of working dogs are normally cropped.\n\n\n== Training ==\nMaremma used as livestock guardian dogs are introduced to sheep flocks as puppies so they bond to the sheep. Some ranchers place Maremma puppies as young as 3\u20134 weeks old with young lambs, but beginning this bonding process at 7\u20138 weeks is more typical. Although it is easiest to bond Maremma to sheep and goats, cattle ranchers have found that the dogs bond with cows and Maremma are increasingly used to protect range cattle. Some ranchers have successfully trained Maremmas to protect free-range fowl, such as chickens, from predation from both ground threats such as coyotes, stray dogs and foxes as well as aerial threats such as raptors (hawks, eagles, owls, etc.).In Warrnambool, Australia, the world's first trial using a Maremma to guard a dwindling little penguin population on Middle Island  against fox attack, commenced in 2006. This project won the 2010 Australian Government Coastcare Award. While using Maremma to guard an endangered species is rare, Maremma along with other breeds of livestock guarding dogs are appreciated by environmentalists because they make it possible for livestock to co-exist with predators such as wolves and coyotes, reducing their predation by 70% to 80% or more.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAbruzzese Mastiff\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 314, "name": "McNab (dog)", "country": "United States", "type": "", "picture": "dog314", "description": "The McNab Dog - commonly called McNab Shepherd or McNab Collie - is a herding dog that originated in the Mendocino region of Northern California.  The McNab was bred to withstand the tough conditions found in California such as heat, burrs, foxtails, and rugged terrain.  Until recently, the McNab was little known outside California, but the last three decades have seen a gain in popularity and geographic dispersal of the breed.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe appearance of the McNab can vary considerably.  The dog is medium-sized with females standing 16-21 inches at the shoulder and weighing 30-50 pounds and males standing 18-25 inches at the shoulder and weighing 35-65 pounds.  The dogs have a variety of ear sets from pricked ears to floppy ears and everything in between.  Most McNabs are black or red with white feet, white collars, white facial strips and white tipped tails, but tricolor McNabs are well known as well as mostly black McNabs.  Their eyes are set well apart, almond shaped, and brown, hazel, or copper colored.  The McNab coat is close, dense and weather resistant.  They can have a slick single short coat, a short double coat, or a medium length single coat, but their fur is never long.  One of the distinctive features of the McNab is their cat-like feet which contribute to their agility.\n\n\n== Breed status ==\nThe McNab is currently not recognized as a standardized breed by any major kennel club, including the American Kennel Club (AKC). This status may change in the future.\nIn 2014, a group of McNab Shepherd breeders and enthusiasts established the McNab Shepherd Registry (MSR). According to the MSR, their goal is to continue the betterment, advancement and welfare of the McNab Shepherd. The MSR is what is known as a \"founding registry\" because they exclusively utilize discovered genetic markers and DNA verification for registration.\nBeginning in 2014, the MSR worked with Mars Veterinary on a study in an attempt to establish a unique genetic signature for the McNab Shepherd.  Samples collected from McNabs across the United States were evaluated for their genetic signature and found to support the creation of a unique breed signature for the McNab. Additionally, the tested dogs were also evaluated for certain physical traits and over 100 disease-causing mutations to help establish a baseline for these in the McNab population.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nMcNab Shepherds require more daily physical exercise and mental stimulation than many other breeds. A working McNab frequently runs for miles a day, using its herding skills to control livestock, and they can become restless if isolated or neglected. Unlike some other herding breeds, McNabs are not hyperactive. Providing a McNab has plenty of exercise, it is content to nap at its owner\u2019s side with a watchful and protective eye.\nMcNabs often bond tightly to their family members, including other household pets.  They have a keen sense of territory and seldom wander away from home.  They are also more likely to defend their territory and family members than many of the more sensitive herding breeds.  \nMcNabs can be assertive and demanding, and they do best with guardians who are firm, consistent and skilled in positive dog training methods that don't trigger the McNabs instinct to push back against obstacles.  Highly intelligent and quick to learn, the McNab needs to exercise its brain as much as its body.  Families considering a McNab for a pet will need to set aside plenty of time to spend with their dog.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nMcNabs are hardy dogs with no breed specific health problems. Their average life span is 13\u201315 years.\nMcNab dogs may carry the MDR1 mutant gene and can be very sensitive to Ivermectin, which is a common ingredient in heartworm prevention medications. This drug and others can cause serious health problems or even death. A DNA test that demonstrates whether a dog has the mutation is available through the Washington State University College of Veterinary Medicine. The test can be completed by sending them a cheek swab through the mail.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nMcNabs have a loose-eyed herding style and tend to work more independently than many herding breeds.  They are skilled at both heading and heeling stock, meaning they can turn stock from the front or get behind stock and drive them forward.  Originally bred to herd sheep, stock handlers quickly discovered that the McNabs bold nature and working abilities made them ideal for herding cattle.  McNabs are also used for herding geese, goats, llamas and gathering horses in from the pasture.  Renowned for their incredible endurance, McNabs have been known to cover over a hundred miles a day driving their herds.McNabs are becoming increasingly popular in the world of dog sports.  Their outstanding athletic prowess and agility coupled with high intelligence make them ideal competitors.  McNabs are now competing successfully in agility trials, dock diving, disc dog competitions, and flyball.  They are also exceptional competitors in barn hunt and nose work.  Many ranchers are competing with McNabs in the relatively new sport of Ranch Dog Herding where dog and handler on horseback work as a team herding three head of cattle through five obstacles and then into a stock trailer.\nThe McNabs reputation as an indefatigable \"all-weather\" dog is also opening up a new avenue of work for the dog: Search and Rescue.  Currently McNabs are working as evidence search dogs, cadaver dogs, archaeology dogs, and area search dogs for missing persons.  Where many other breeds have to be pulled off the search because the dog is tiring, the only limitation for the McNab is the energy of its handler.\nIn addition to the above activities,  McNabs are now becoming more common as service dogs, demonstrating sensitivity to the medical and psychological needs of humans.\n\n\n== History ==\nAlexander McNab left his native Scotland in the late 19th Century homesteading his 10,000 acre sheep ranch located in the Sanel Rancho, which later became Hopland, California. Looking to develop a herding dog that could handle the rough conditions on his ranch, McNab crossed the Scottish Collies he brought with him with the tough dogs of the nomadic Basque sheepherders he met near his ranch. McNab aptly called his dogs \u201cMcNab Shepherds.\u201dIn the early 1900s, the elder McNab passed the ranch down to his youngest son, John McNab, an attorney and stockman who reinvigorated his father\u2019s breeding style. Refinement of the McNab Shepherd continued and additional dogs were imported from Scotland for breeding and ranching purposes.Over time, the McNab dogs proved to be supreme herding dogs which California ranchers came to depend on with confidence.  Now the breed is spreading across the United States and Canada with a few McNabs working as stock dogs in Germany and some sporting McNabs as far away as Japan.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links =="}, {"id": 315, "name": "Mexican Hairless Dog", "country": "Mexico", "type": "Sighthound and Pariah", "picture": "dog315", "description": "The Xoloitzcuintli (), or Xolo for short, is a hairless breed of dog, found in toy, miniature, and standard sizes. The Xolo also comes in a coated variety and coated and hairless can be born in the same litter. It is characterized by its sparse hair coat and a severe oligodontia. This phenotype is a consequence of Canine Ectodermal Dysplasia caused by a mutation on the Foxl3 autosomal gene. It is also known as Mexican hairless dog in English-speaking countries, and is one of several breeds of hairless dog. \nIn Nahuatl, from which its English name originates, its name is x\u014dl\u014ditzcuintli [\u0283o\u02d0lo\u02d0it\u0361s\u02c8k\u02b7int\u0361\u026ci] (singular) and x\u014dl\u014ditzcuintin [\u0283o\u02d0lo\u02d0it\u0361s\u02c8k\u02b7intin] (plural). The name x\u014dl\u014ditzcuintli comes from the god Xolotl and itzcu\u012bntli [it\u0361sk\u02b7i\u02d0nt\u0361\u026ci], meaning dog in Nahuatl.A genetic study was recently conducted in order to determine the origin of the Xoloitzcuintle breed. The study did not find a close genetic relationship between Xoloitzcuintle and the Chinese Crested Dog, another hairless breed that is cited by the American Kennel Club as an ancestor to the Xoloitzcuintle.  The modern Xoloitzcuintle appears to be a result of a mixture of the aboriginal, pre-Columbian Xoloitzcuintle, itself a descendant of a domesticated dog that came with the ancestors of indigenous Americans from Asia, with one or more southern European herding dog breeds during the Columbian Exchange.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nArchaeological evidence has been found in the tombs of the Colima, Mayan, Toltec, Zapotec, and Aztec Native Americans dating the breed to over 3500 years ago.  Long regarded as guardians and protectors, the indigenous peoples believed that the Xolo would safeguard the home from evil spirits as well as intruders.  In ancient times the Xolos were often sacrificed and then buried with their owners to act as guide to the soul on its journey to the underworld. These dogs were considered a great delicacy, and were consumed for sacrificial ceremonies\u2013including marriages and funerals. Most likely, early forerunners of the Xolo originated as spontaneous hairless mutations of indigenous American dogs. Hairlessness may have conferred a survival advantage in tropical regions. Indigenous peoples of Mexico had Xolo dogs as home and hunting companions, and today they are still very popular companion dogs. They are also the national dog of Mexico. Their value in ancient native cultures is evidenced by their frequent appearance in art and artifacts.\nXolos were considered sacred dogs by the Aztecs, Toltecs, Maya, and other groups. They were also useful companion animals. According to Aztec mythology, the god Xolotl made the Xoloitzcuintli from a sliver of the Bone of Life from which all mankind was made. Xolotl gave this gift to Man with the instruction to guard it with his life and in exchange it would guide Man through the dangers of Mictlan, the world of Death, toward the Evening Star in the Heavens. Some people in Mexico continue to believe this breed has healing qualities. The Aztecs also raised the breed for their meat. Sixteenth-century Spanish accounts tell of large numbers of dogs being served at banquets. Aztec Merchant feasts could have 80\u2013100 turkeys and 20\u201340 dogs served as food. When these two meats were served in the same dish, the dog meat was at the bottom of the dish, either because it was held in higher regard or because it was increasingly considered a step above cannibalism.\n\nThe Aztecs consumed few domesticated animals like Xolos or turkey. Over 90% of the bones found at archeological sites are of deer that were hunted.When Christopher Columbus arrived in the Caribbean in 1492, his journal entries noted the presence of strange hairless dogs. Subsequently, Xolos were transported back to Europe.The breed is not well known in the United States. As a result, the Xolo has been mistaken for the mythical Chupacabras of Mexico.The Xoloitzcuintle is the symbol of Club Tijuana, a Mexican professional football club.\n\n\n== Registry ==\n\n\n=== F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) ===\nDespite the Xolo's more than 3000-year history in Mexico, the breed did not receive any official notice in its homeland until the 1950s. The FCI, founded in 1940, was not prepared to declare the Xolo an official purebred at that time. According to breed historian Norman Pelham Wright, author of The Enigma of the Xoloitzcuintli, Xolos began to turn up at Mexican dog shows in the late 1940s. Although they were recognized as indigenous specimens of a native breed, interest in them was minimal at that time, because information was scarce and no standard existed by which to judge them. Within a decade the FCI realized that the breed would become extinct if drastic action were not taken to save it. This led to the widely publicized Xolo Expedition of 1954. With the official sanction of the FCI, Wright and a team of Mexican and British dog authorities set off to discover if any purebred Xolos still existed in remote areas of Mexico.\nEventually ten structurally strong Xolos were found and these dogs formed the foundation of Mexico's program to revive the breed. A committee headed by Wright authored the first official standard for the breed; on May 1, 1956, the Xolo was finally recognized in its native land and, as Mexico is a member of the FCI, worldwide.\n\n\n=== American Kennel Club (AKC) ===\n\nXolos were among the first breeds recorded by the American Kennel Club (AKC). A Mexican dog named 'Mee Too' made breed history as the first AKC-registered Xolo in 1887. 'Chinito Junior', bred and owned by Valetska Radtke of New York City, became the breed's only AKC champion to date. He earned his title on October 19, 1940.\nIn 1959, the Xolo was dropped from the AKC stud book due to the breed's scarcity and perceived extinction. The Xoloitzcuintli Club of America (XCA) was founded in October 1986 to regain AKC recognition for the breed. On May 13, 2008, AKC voted to readmit the breed to its Miscellaneous Class starting January 1, 2009. The XCA is the official parent club for the breed, founded on October 26, 1986, for the purpose of regaining AKC recognition for the Xoloitzcuintli. The founding members voted unanimously to recognize all three sizes (toy, miniature and standard) and both varieties (hairless and coated) at their initial meeting. Since then, the XCA has compiled a stud book modeled on requirements for eventual AKC acceptance, held an annual independent specialty show, published a quarterly newsletter, The Xolo News, and maintained an active national rescue network, National Xolo Rescue (known before 2009 as The Xolo Rescue League). Since January 1, 2007, FSS registered Xolos have been eligible to compete in AKC performance events.  The breed was moved into the AKC Studbook in December 2010 and has been eligible to be shown in the AKC Non-Sporting group since January 1, 2011.The first AKC Group Winning Xolo was Bayshore Mole who won a Group 4 placement February 2, 2011, and this was followed by his littermate Bayshore Georgio Armani receiving back to back group placement. On August 8, 2011, Bayshore Georgio Armani became the first Xolo to be named Best in Show in AKC competition. Bayshore Mole became the first Xolo to win back to back Best in Shows on September 3 and 4, 2011. Both dogs were bred by Bayshore Kennel in Virginia.In February 2012, the Xolo was one of 6 new breeds to make their first appearance at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe breed ranges in size from about 10 to 50 lb (4 to 20 kg). Similar in appearance to a Pharaoh Hound, with a sleek body, almond-shaped eyes, large bat-like ears, and a long neck, the Xolo is notable for its dominant trait of hairlessness. The dominant hairless trait originated in this breed as a spontaneous mutation thousands of years ago. The recessive expression of the trait will produce a coated variety, which is genetically inseparable from the hairless, as the homozygous appearance of the hairless mutation is fatal to the unborn pup. Most litters contain both hairless and coated puppies. The coated variety, covered with a short, flat dense coat represents the original form of the dog, prior to the occurrence of the spontaneous hairless mutation. The hairless variety is completely hairless on the body, with many dogs exhibiting a few short hairs on the top of the head, the toes, and the tip of the tail. Most hairless dogs are black or bluish-gray in color.\nThe allele responsible for the Xolo's hairlessness also affects the dog's dentition: Hairless Xolos typically have an incomplete set of teeth while the dogs of the coated variety have complete dentition.\nThe Xolo is moderate in all aspects of its appearance, conveying an impression of strength, agility, and elegance. Xolo body proportions are rectangular, slightly longer in total body length than the height measured at the highest point of the withers (top of the shoulders).  The breed occurs naturally in two varieties, hairless and coated. Hairless Xolos are the dominant expression of the heterozygous Hh hairless trait. Coated Xolos (hh) are the recessive expression, and breeding hairless to coated or hairless to hairless may produce pups of either or both varieties. Breeding coated to coated will only produce coated pups because they are recessive to the hairless trait and do not carry the dominant H gene.\nBoth varieties occur in all hair or skin colors, and often marked, splashed, or spotted. The most common colors are various shades termed black, blue, and red. The breed occurs in a range of sizes, which breeders have standardized into three designations.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe Xoloitzcuintli's 'primitive' temperament (very high intelligence, sensitivity, high energy, inquisitiveness, strong hunting, and social instincts) is apparent because the breed's temperament was not modified overall by selective breeding in their native history in Mexico. This has also ensured a sturdy physical nature and vigorous health generally innate in both coated and uncoated Xolos. Adult Xolos are frequently noted for their calm demeanor, although puppies can be extremely energetic, noisy, and very oral until they reach maturity (after 2 years old), after which they tend to settle down and become more calm. Inadequately supervised or exercised Xolos can become escape artists, climbing and jumping fences to chase. Many individuals of this breed can possess guard dog ability and will not back down from a fight. At the same time, adult dogs, when they are raised properly, can become steady, well-behaved, and affectionate companions.\nThough physically grown at one year, many dog breeds including Xolos, are not 'emotionally mature' until around two years. Like active breeds such as terriers, Xolos need calm, consistent, and loving obedience training and regular socialization during their growing years. Well-raised Xolos bond strongly with their owners, becoming highly devoted to their families while frequently choosing one specific family member as favorite.\n\nAnyone considering acquiring a Xolo should expect to spend time educating themselves in positive dog training techniques, and, ideally, should have prior experience with active and intelligent dog breeds. A spacious, well-fenced, and safe physical environment is desirable for this breed. Daily walks are ideal for exercising most toy-sized Xolos, however more stimulating physical and mental exercise is advised for larger and more active individuals. Behavior problems in Xolos are typically a result of a dog receiving inadequate or inconsistent supervision, as well as inadequate exercise and mental stimulation. The Xoloitzcuintli is a social dog that should not, in most cases, be an \"only dog\". It does not do well when kept as an outside-only dog. This is a breed that is at its best when it is made part of the family, receiving regular interaction and socialization with its humans (and other dogs, whether present in the home or as regular playmates).\n\n\n=== Health ===\nThe Xolo has been developed by natural selection for thousands of years, and is therefore generally not prone to health and structure problems as other dog breeds more modified by human selection efforts. Xolos came from tropical climates and are not suited for outdoor life in colder temperate and northern climates; they should be considered an indoor dog breed.  They need bathing, light grooming, and skin care as with other dogs of similar physical type, or acne can result. Most skin problems arise from poor breeding, neglect, or over-bathing and over-lotioning, stripping natural protections and clogging pores.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nXolos are a common subject in Mexican artist Frida Kahlo's paintings.\nXolo was featured in Royal de Luxe's street theater performances in Guadalajara, Mexico (November 2010), Nantes, France (May 2011), and Liverpool (April 2012). A huge puppet of the dog accompanied the company's famous Giants.\nClub Tijuana Xoloitzcuintles de Caliente is a Mexican football club named after the dog breed.\nThe Xolo was featured for the first time in the 2012 Westminster Dog Show.\nA Xolo photograph won 1st place in the \"Animal Kingdom\" Life Framer competition (2015).\nA Xolo named Dante is featured in the Disney/Pixar film Coco.\nIn one famous urban legend, a woman brings home what she believes to be a Mexican Hairless dog from a trip to Mexico, only for it to turn out to be a rabid sewer rat.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHairless dog\nPeruvian Hairless Dog\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nThe Xolo Handbook.

Their small size was looked upon with favor, as they could more easily double as a household pet. They became especially popular with equestrians traveling to horse shows, as their intelligence, loyalty, and size made them an excellent travel companion. In this way their popularity spread across the country. Today, the Miniature American Shepherd is established across the U.S. and internationally.

Body structure suggests strength, but not bulkiness, with a clean-cut head and neck proportional to the body. The topline is level from withers to hip joint. The tail may be a natural bobtail, or may be docked to a length not exceeding three inches.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nThe coat is of medium length and may be straight or wavy, with moderate feathering present on the backs of the legs. Both sexes have a moderate mane and frill, though it is generally more pronounced in males than in females. The undercoat varies according to the climate in which the dog dwells.\nRecognized coat colors in the breed are black, blue merle, red merle, and red (liver). There are no specified quantities of marbling, flecking, or blotching for merle coats. Tan markings are permissible anywhere around the eyes and face, as well as on the feet, legs, chest, muzzle, underside of the neck and body, under the tail, and on the undersides of the ears. White markings are permissible, but limited to the muzzle, cheeks, crown of the head, in a blaze on the head, in a partial or full collar on the neck, and on the belly, chest, front legs, and hind legs to the hock. White markings should not cover more than 25% of the ear, and white body markings outside of the above permitted areas may disqualify the dog from competition.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Miniature American Shepherd is described as an intelligent working breed with strong instincts for herding and flock guarding.

The first existence is documented 1872 in The Dogs of British Island.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nMiniature Bull Terriers have short, fine, and glossy coats that are very close to the skin, like Bull Terriers. They are accepted in the ring to be white, white with another colour, or fully coloured. However, like the Bull Terriers, any blue or liver coloured coats are undesirable. These dogs require minimal grooming.\nIn the early 1900s, the difference between the breeds was determined by the dog's weight. However, this led to Miniature Bull Terriers becoming so small and fine that they looked more like a Chihuahua than a Bull Terrier. So, in the 1970s, the weight limit was replaced with a height limit of under fourteen inches. They are usually no smaller than ten inches.  According to the AKC, miniature bull terriers' weight must be proportionate to its height. However, they tend to range anywhere from 20\u201335 lbs.\nThe Miniature Bull Terriers have a very bold build. They have very muscular shoulders and a full body. Like the Bull Terrier, they have a head described as \"egg-shaped\". It is flat on top with a Roman nose. The eyes are triangular and closely set. The ears are carried erect and are not cropped or otherwise altered. The tail is carried horizontally rather than vertically.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nLike Bull Terriers, Miniature Bull Terriers are loving and, like many terrier breeds, they can be stubborn at times; but despite this they make great dogs for people with limited space.\nMiniature Bull Terriers are known to be stubborn and courageous. Despite their dimuitive stature, they will readily challenge larger dogs. However, as with any dog, owners can reduce the likelihood of confrontations by providing appropriate training. They are very energetic and playful and love people, but care must be taken as they are variable around other dogs.\nMiniature Bull Terriers require little grooming. A quick brushing once a day or a few times a week is sufficient. Sunscreen must be used on any sparse white sections of fur around the face, ears, hindquarters or stomach when outdoors (especially in the summer between the hours of 10am and 2pm) to avoid sunburn and cancer.\n\n\n=== Training ===\nMiniatures are independent and stubborn and do require a lot of training, particularly early on. They must be heavily socialized at a young age and trained to obey early in their lives. They also are very energetic and seem to be able to play endlessly as puppies. However, as they grow older, they become less energetic. They must be carefully exercised and dieted to avoid obesity.\n\n\n== Health ==\nMiniature Bull Terriers are prone to many health problems (physiologic and psychologic) anyone considering adopting a bull terrier must be aware of these issues!\nDeafness occurs in both coloured and white Miniature Bull Terriers. Puppies can be born unilaterally deaf (deaf in one ear) or bilaterally deaf (deaf in both ears). Deaf dogs should not be bred due to deafness being hereditary. BEAP (or BAER) testing is done on puppies prior to sale to discover which puppies have hearing problems.\nLAD or LETHAL ACRODERMATITIS in bull terriers. Is a LETHAL genetic degenerative disease. It starts appearing in puppies around the age of 4 weeks. The usual black color of affected puppies will start to appear diluted and turn liverish, due to a zinc deficiency which result in terrible skin condition, dysfunction of their overall system and eventually premature death. A new DNA test was released to test breeding stock and ensure LAD CLEAR puppies. \nhttp://www.miniaturebullterrierclub.org/health/lethal-acrodermatitis\nMiniature Bull Terriers are also susceptible to having luxating patellas. This is a knee problem common in small dogs. It can be treated by surgery. \nPolycystic kidney disease (PKD) and Bull Terrier hereditary nephritis (BTHN) are autosomal dominant diseases. PKD is diagnosed by Ultrasonic scan by a specialist veterinarian. BTHN is diagnosed by a UPC test. Dogs with a score of .3 or below are considered clear of the disease. Clearing breeding stock prior to use ensures that progeny are not affected with the disease.\nMiniature Bull Terriers are also susceptible to eye problems such as primary lens luxation. PLL is a late onset disease which typically affects dogs between the ages of mid 2 and 7. Younger and older cases are known. During September 2009 a definitive DNA test was released by the Animal Health Trust. This test gives three results: Clear, Carrier, or Affected.\nAortic valve stenosis and mitral valve dysplasia are heart diseases. Diagnosis is made by colour doppler echocardiography scanning by a specialist veterinarian.\nDisorders of the skin of a Miniature Bull Terrier can occur. Pyotraumatic dermatitis (hot spots), allergic reactions, and hives can be problematic. \nU.K. and U.S. breed surveys shows an average lifespan of 10-14 years.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhen the Bull Terrier breed was first created in 19th century England, it was about the same size as the Miniature Bull Terrier.  Miniature Bull Terriers were granted membership in the American Kennel Club (AKC) on May 14, 1991 (effective January 1, 1992).\n\n\n== Interbreeding ==\nInterbreeding, the process of mating together a Miniature Bull Terrier and Bull Terrier, is allowed, but only for a short time, in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Interbreeding is undertaken to reduce the incidence of Primary Lens Luxation in the Miniature. The Bull Terrier does not carry the PLL gene, so all progeny are phenotypically normal for the disease.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBull Terrier\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMiniature Bull Terrier at Curlie"}, {"id": 319, "name": "Miniature Fox Terrier", "country": "Australia", "type": "", "picture": "dog319", "description": "The Miniature Fox Terrier is a small, fine, lightweight working terrier developed as a hunting dog and vermin router.  It is known colloquially in its native Australia as the \u201cMini Foxie\u201d.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nA balanced, smoothly-muscled dog breed, the Miniature Fox Terrier has a small sized, distinctive head with erectile ears that can stand straight up or fold at the tips. Another distinguishing feature is its articulate, oval-shaped foot - a feature found in very few small breeds of dog. The breed standard has always allowed for the dog's tail to be docked or undocked, however owners need to be aware of and obey local laws in this regard. Natural bobtails are known to occur. There are only three permitted colour combinations: black & white, tan & white, and black, tan & white. The coat of the Miniature Fox Terrier is always short and fine. Weight is 3.5 to 5.5 kilograms (8 to 12 lbs) and height at the withers is 9.5 to 12.0 inches  (24 cm to 30.5 cm).\nMiniature Fox Terriers are closely related to the Toy Fox Terrier, a breed that developed along similar lines in the United States. Some Toy Fox Terrier owners can trace their dogs\u2019 pedigrees to \"Foiler\", the first Fox Terrier registered by the Kennel Club in Britain, circa 1875-6. Other related breeds include the Jack Russell Terrier, the Rat Terrier, and the Tenterfield Terrier.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nBred for hunting rodents (rats, mice) and rabbits principally, these dogs are known for their speed and agility. With the ruthlessness of their attack on rodent pest species and their ability to squeeze into and out of tight spaces, they have made themselves an indispensable part of many Australian farms since the 19th Century.  Miniature Fox Terriers have proved well-suited to being domestic pets in more urban environments (according to the breed club). Their diminutive size, short clean hair and loyal acceptance of their place in the social hierarchy make them good pets, particularly in households with small children.  They thrive on positive socialisation and are happy to be rewarded with pats and being praised when being trained and trainers do not have to rely on treats to obtain a good result.\nMiniature Fox Terriers generally get along well with other animals but, like most working terriers, cannot distinguish between small pets\u2014such as reptiles and fancy rats\u2014and vermin, and so should not be left alone with such animals. They are confident and will generally interact with dogs and other animals many times their size.\n\n\n== Health ==\nMiniature Fox Terriers are generally healthy and hardy despite their size.  They need little maintenance; some individuals that do not run often on hard surfaces will need regular nail clipping. Luxating patellae, a common ailment among small breeds, occurs frequently among backyard bred dogs, bred by people who are not registered breeders; the Mini Foxie Club rules state that, before breeding occurs, a health declaration must be obtained from a veterinarian and that the dog must be classified and graded by the club.  This rule has greatly helped to reduce the incidence of luxating patellae in the breed.  Meals should always be small and nutritious; this is a small breed, with a small sized stomach. To avoid or minimise painful ailments such as arthritis, dogs need to be kept trim and athletic.\n\n\n=== Longevity ===\nMiniature Fox Terriers are renowned for their good health and longevity, often reaching an advanced age. With good care and a happy life, Miniature Fox Terriers can live as long as 18 to 20 years, and sometimes beyond. Factors influencing longevity include a healthy diet, a sense of belonging, sufficient exercise, room to run around and generally how happy the dog is.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe breed was most likely developed from crosses between smaller Fox Terriers and Fox Terrier types and Toy Manchester Terriers, and, later, some were crossed to other toy breeds such as the English Toy Terrier and Whippet. Hunters were seeking a smaller, speedy Fox Terrier that could be used for hunting smaller pests such as rats and rabbits.  Although the origins of the breed are English, the breed was developed in and is endemic to Australia.  By the late 19th century, the breed type was clearly identifiable and these small terriers proved their worth against rabbits, rats, and snakes on Australian farms, where they were often known simply as \"the little foxies\". The dogs demonstrated tenacity, endurance, and extreme loyalty to their owners; they were routinely taken on the hunt, were sometimes used in search parties, and were used at Sydney\u2019s North Head Quarantine Station, the Riverstone Meat Works, and the Brisbane City Council as vermin exterminators.\nThe dog\u2019s vigilance, size, affectionate temperament, and ease of care soon resulted in its becoming a popular choice in urban centers as well, and by the 1920s the Miniature Fox Terrier was iconic. So well known and popular was the \u201cLittle Foxie\u201d that very little thought was given to the need to preserve its lines.\n\n\n=== History of the breed club ===\nBy the 1980s, the interest in dog fancy, the looming spectre of proposed breed-specific legislation, and increasing concerns about the need to protect purebred dogs led a group of enthusiasts to begin meeting informally to consider the future of these little dogs. In July 1986, the Miniature Fox Terrier Club of Australia (MFCA) was formed. The founding members, in conjunction with members of the Royal NSW Canine Council, wrote a breed standard for the breed and laid out a Constitution for the Club. To comply with New South Wales government regulations for becoming an incorporated organization, the Miniature Fox Terrier Club became incorporated as the Mini Foxie Club of Australia, Inc. in 1992.\nIn 1991, fanciers in South Australia also formed a breed club.  For these members, official recognition of the dog by the Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) was the most important of their goals. At that time, challenges to the name \u201cMiniature Fox Terrier\u201d were being mounted, and threatened to preclude recognition by an All-Breed club.  These members joined with some owners in Western Australia and organised as the Tenterfield Terrier Club of Australia (1993), a name which was first used by a television personality of that era.\nThe ensuing breed standard for the Tenterfield Terrier differs in substance from that of the Miniature Fox Terrier, and though the two dogs are sometimes confused, they have been developing along divergent lines for over twenty years and are now different breeds.  Some years ago the ANKC placed a moratorium on the registration of any MFCA-registered Miniature Fox Terrier as a Tenterfield Terrier.  MFCA registered pedigrees are protected by Australian Copyright Law.\nThe breed is not recognized by the ANKC and the independent Mini Foxie Club of Australia Inc. holds the registry of pedigrees for this breed. The club also organises shows, prints a quarterly newsletter and promotes a lively and friendly atmosphere amongst members. The club's strict policies that were put in place to protect the health and soundness of this unique breed have paid dividends. Pups are in great demand and are not always available.  Anyone considering buying a puppy is wise to enquire about an MFCA registered puppy; MFCA registered breeders are listed on the club's website:  www.minifoxie.org\nIn 2005, the breed names Miniature Fox Terrier and Mini Foxie were added to the list of dog breeds recognized under the NSW Companion Animals Act. MFCA registered breeders can register their breeding dogs with their local council.\n\n\n=== The Miniature Fox Terrier today ===\nAlthough still relatively unknown outside of Australia and New Zealand, \"the little foxie\" is renowned in its native land. Parliamentarians have made reference to the breed during legislative hearings on canine issues. 'Pasqua' and \u2018Fergus\u2019 owned by Anthony Field of The Wiggles, are Miniature Fox Terriers now aged 17. Ian Thorpe, the Australian swimmer, has spoken fondly of Tiny, his Miniature Fox Terrier, in several interviews. Sean Carlow, Australian men's figure skating champion, owns a Miniature Fox Terrier.  Television and print media have also featured Toby Allen of Human Nature with his Miniature Fox Terriers.\nToday, the Miniature Fox Terrier is still very much a working terrier and is in demand on farms across Australia.  They remain popular as pets and enjoy playing the pampered pooch. As long as their active minds are kept stimulated with games or toys and they receive at least moderate exercise, they make excellent pets for anyone with kids, the elderly and are great companions.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFox Terrier\nToy Terrier\nRat Terrier\nTenterfield Terrier\n\n\n== References ==\nCurry, Aleta, et al.

The breed's earliest ancestors may have included the German Pinscher mixed with Italian greyhounds and dachshunds.Historical artifacts and paintings place the Min Pin as a very old breed, but factual documentation began less than 200 years ago, leaving their actual origins to debate. The Miniature Pinscher is reported to include the Dachshund and Italian Greyhound among its ancestors. Many historians and those who have researched the background of the breed agree that this heritage is most likely correct, adding the shorthaired German Pinscher to the family tree.\nThe international kennel club, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, lists the Miniature Pinscher in Group 2, Section 1.1 Pinscher, along with the Dobermann, the German Pinscher, the Austrian Pinscher, and the other Toy Pinscher, the Affenpinscher. Other kennel clubs list the Miniature Pinscher in the Toy Group or Companion Group.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe misconception that the Miniature Pinscher is a \"miniature Doberman\" occurred because the Doberman Pinscher (a breed developed by Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann around 1890) was introduced to the U.S. before the Miniature Pinscher. In 1919, the Miniature Pinscher was introduced to the AKC show ring. At the time, not knowing that it was referred to officially in Germany as the Zwergpinscher (little biter), the AKC referred to the breed as simply \"Pinscher\" and listed it in the miscellaneous category. When the Miniature Pinscher Club of America (MPCA) was created in 1929 (the year of the breed's official introduction into the AKC), they petitioned for Miniature Pinschers to be placed in the Toy group. The AKC's description, that the dog \"must appear as a Doberman in miniature,\" led to the misconception common today that this breed is a \"Miniature Doberman Pinscher.\"\nThe original name for this breed in the U.S. was \"Pinscher (Toy)\" until 1972 when the name was officially changed to Miniature Pinscher.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHistorical artifacts and paintings indicate that the \"Min Pin\" is a very old breed, but factual documentation begins less than 200 years ago, which leaves the breed's actual origins open to debate. There is a drawing by Jean Bungartz, published in 1888 comparing the Miniature Pinscher to the German Pinscher.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Miniature Pinscher is structurally a well balanced, sturdy, compact, short-coupled, smooth-coated dog. They are naturally well groomed, vigorous and alert. Characteristic traits are their hackney-like action, fearless animation, complete self-possession, and spirited presence. Legs should be straight with no bending in or out. The Miniature Pinscher frequently has a docked tail and cropped ears, though the AKC no longer requires ear cropping for shows.\n\n\n==== Size ====\nAccording to the American Kennel Club, the Miniature Pinscher should be 10\u201312 1\u20442 inches (25\u201332 cm) high with most desirable height 11\u201311 1\u20442 inches (28\u201329 cm) at the highest point of the shoulder blades. Length is equal to height, though females may be slightly longer. The ideal weight is 8\u201310 pounds (3.6\u20134.5 kg).\n\n\n==== Coat and color ====\n\nThe coat is short and smooth, with no undercoat. Available colors include solid red, stag red, blue stag red, chocolate stag red, fawn stag red, as well as black, chocolate, blue, and fawn with tan points or rust points. For showing in the United States, the AKC disqualifies all colors but the solid or stag red and the black or chocolate with rust points. The Pinscher-Schnauzer Club, which maintains the standard for showing in Germany, has the same restrictions. In the UK, blue with rust points is allowed in the show ring. White spots larger than half an inch or black spots on the points are disqualifications for showing in most countries. Merle is not an accepted coloring of the breed.\n\n\n=== Care ===\nGrooming is easy, as the smooth, short-haired coat requires little attention, needing only occasional brushing and shampooing. Care must be taken in cold weather.  Sweaters or baby blankets can help keep a Miniature Pinscher from getting too cold. Miniature Pinschers are an active breed and need access to a fenced yard, or be given a daily walk.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nMiniature Pinschers  are for experienced dog owners. Many people underestimate the care, time, and effort needed in order to raise a Miniature Pinscher. The Miniature Pinscher is an assertive, outgoing, active, and independent breed. Miniature pinschers are energetic and need a fenced yard to run in; they make great agility dogs. They are great escape artists and some recommend having a kennel with a lid on it for them to run around in. They are good watchdogs, as they are alert and wary of strangers.It is recommended that adults and teenagers, rather than young children, play with a Miniature Pinscher as younger children play rough.Miniature Pinschers are a stubborn breed when it comes to training, but once trained they will obey commands well. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links =="}, {"id": 321, "name": "Miniature Schnauzer", "country": "Germany", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog321", "description": "The Miniature Schnauzer is a breed of small dog of the Schnauzer type that originated in Germany in the mid-to-late 19th century. Miniature Schnauzers may have been developed from smallest specimens of the Standard Schnauzer, or crosses between the Standard and one or more smaller breeds such as the Affenpinscher, Miniature Pinscher, and Poodles, as farmers bred a small dog that was an efficient ratting dog. They are described as \"spunky\" but aloof dogs, with good guarding tendencies without some guard dogs' predisposition to bite. Miniature Schnauzers are recognized in three colors internationally: solid black, black and silver, and pepper and salt.  There is a controversial fourth color variant in Miniature Schnauzers, pure white, which is not recognized universally.\nIt is the most popular Schnauzer breed, and remains one of the most popular worldwide, primarily for its temperament and relatively small size. As of 2017 it is the 17th most popular breed in the U.S.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest records surrounding the development of the Standard Schnauzer in Germany come from the late 19th century. They were originally bred to be medium-sized farm dogs in Germany, equally suited to ratting, herding, and guarding property. As time passed, farmers bred the Standard Schnauzer into a smaller, more compact size for ratting by combining it, according to cynologists theorization, with one or more small breeds such as the Affenpinscher and Miniature Poodle, Miniature Pinscher, or Pomeranian, or by chance from smallest specimens of the Standard Schnauzer. The first recorded Miniature Schnauzer appeared in 1888, black female named Fidel, and the Pinscher-Schnauzer Klub (formed in 1895) in its first volume of the club's stud book mentioned Wirehaired Miniature Pinscher. The first exhibition was held in 1899.The AKC accepted registration of the new breed in 1926, two years after Miniature Schnauzers were introduced to the United States. The American Miniature Schnauzer Club was formed in 1933, from the older parent club Wire-Haired Pinscher Club of America which also included Standard Schnauzer, and initially both competed in the Working Group until 1927. International Kennel Club classifications vary; by the VDH and FCI it is placed in \"Group 2, Section 1: Pinschers and Schnauzers\", with \"Nr. 183\" in \"Section 1.2\" dedicated to the Miniature Schnauzer breed, the KC, ANKC and NZKC include it in the Utility Group, while by the AKC, UKC and CKC the Miniature Schnauzer is classed in the Terrier Group.The start of the modern Miniature Schnauzer in the United States is considered to have a beginning in 1924 when four dogs were imported from Germany. It is argued that almost all American-bred Miniatures partly descend from them, and between 1926-1936, 108 more dogs were imported. One of the most notable champions was Ch. Dorem Display, born in 1945 and lived to be nearly fourteen. It is claimed that many champion Miniature Schnauzers in America can trace its lineage back to Dorem Display.Miniature Schnauzers were the 11th most popular breed in the U.S. in 2008, falling to 17th most popular in 2016.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nMiniature Schnauzers have a very square-shaped build, measuring 11 to 14 inches (28 to 36 cm) tall and weighing 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 6.8 kg) for females and 11 to 18 pounds (5.0 to 8.2 kg) for males. They have a double coat, with wiry exterior fur and a soft undercoat. In show trim, the coat is kept short on the body, but the fur on the ears, legs, belly, and face is retained. Recognized coat colors are black, salt and pepper, black and silver, and pure white; salt and pepper coloration is where coat hairs have banded shades of black, gray and silver, fading to a gray or silver at the eyebrows, whiskers, underbody and legs.Miniature Schnauzers are often described as non-moulting dogs, and while this is not entirely true, their shedding is minimal and generally unnoticeable. They are characterized by a rectangular head with bushy beard, mustache, and eyebrows; teeth that meet in a \"scissor bite\"; oval and dark colored eyes; and v-shaped, natural forward-folding ears (when cropped, the ears point straight upward and come to a sharp point). Their tails are naturally thin and short, and may be docked (where permitted). They will also have very straight, rigid front legs, and feet that are short and round (so-called \"cat feet\") with thick, black pads.Docking of tails and cropping of ears has become a controversial practice, especially for non-working dogs, and is now illegal or restricted in a number of countries worldwide.\n\n\n==== North American white coat controversy ====\n\nWhite is one of four color varieties of the Miniature Schnauzer currently recognized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale. However, they are not accepted for conformation showing by the American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club. The controversy rests on the disputed origins of the white variation: whether it was contained within the genes of the originally recognized breed, or whether it was the result of subsequent modifications. Since the other two schnauzer types have never been available in a white variation, and the original German standard never included white as an acceptable color, the AMSC chooses not to recognize white.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe American Kennel Club breed standard describes temperament as \"alert and spirited, yet obedient to command ... friendly, intelligent and willing to please... never overaggressive or timid\". Usually easy to train, they tend to be excellent watchdogs with a good territorial instinct, but more inclined toward barking than biting. They are often aloof with strangers until the owners of the home welcome the guest, upon which they are typically very friendly to them. Although in North America is included in the Terrier Group (due to rat-catching background), it does not have common ancestry with Terriers from Great Britain, and compared to them has different personality, being more laidback, obedient, friendly, and less aggressive to other dogs.They are highly playful dogs, and, if not given the outlet required for their energy, they can become bored and invent their own \"fun\". Miniature Schnauzers can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, and tracking. Schnauzers have a high prey drive, which means they may chase other small animals hence should not be off leash when not in fenced area. Based on Stanley Coren's book The Intelligence of Dogs (2006) ranking methodology, the Miniature ranked 12th out of 140 breeds within 79 ranks on the ability to learn and obey new commands i.e. working and obedience intelligence, being grouped among \"excellent working dogs\". Additionally, experts ranked the Miniature as 5th among top 15 breeds at watchdog barking ability.\n\n\n== Health and grooming ==\n\n\n=== Health ===\nA UK Kennel Club survey puts the median lifespan of Miniature Schnauzers at a little over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, Miniature Schnauzers may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and unsweetened foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to comedone syndrome, a condition that produces pus-filled bumps, usually on their backs, which can be treated with a variety of methods. Miniature Schnauzers should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations should be part of the regular annual check up. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\nSchnauzers have a specific groom cut that is standard among the schnauzer breeds. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping (mostly seen in show dogs), or by clipping (a short-cut usually reserved for family pets). Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. Regular grooming of a Miniature Schnauzer is recommended approximately every six weeks. Clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDutch Smoushond\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMiniature Schnauzer at Curlie"}, {"id": 322, "name": "Miniature Shar Pei", "country": "China", "type": "", "picture": "dog322", "description": "The Miniature Shar Pei or Mini Pei is a breed of dog with slightly smaller proportions than the larger Standard Shar Pei. They have been bred to be smaller in size through a recessive gene carried in their DNA.  The reduced size of this breed creates a versatile dog that is unique yet small, making for a good family companion.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe \"miniature shar-pei\"  is not classified by any Kennel Club as a separate breed.   The mini shar-pei has been bred from a recessive gene of the shar-pei, i.e.,  the runt of the litter bred from the run of the litter,  to create a smaller specimen.\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe appearance and shape of the breed can be described as broad and square in proportion to height and body length.  Their physical attributes are much the same as their larger brethren having a large head, wide padded muzzle, highly set ears, blue black tongue, with wrinkled head, neck and shoulders.\n\n\n==== Size ====\nThe height of a Miniature Shar Pei does not exceed 17 inches high at the withers; over 17 inches is a disqualification and does not meet the breed standard.  In terms of weight, they range from 25 to 45lbs.\n\n\n==== Coat ====\nThe coat can be classified as one of three types. \"Horse Coat\" being not more than one quarter inch in length with a harsh feel, \"Brush Coat\" less than one inch in length with a velvety feel, or \"Bear Coat\" being longer than one inch in length with a wavy smooth feel.  Shedding in this breed is minimal and occurs through a process called \"blowing coat\".  This usually happens in the spring and fall over a short period of a few days.\n\n\n==== Color ====\n\nColoring can be any variety of White (very rare), Fawn, Cream, Chocolate, Apricot, Red, Lilac, Blue, or Black in Solid, Sable or Dilute variations; Dilute being a dog whose nose, nails, pads, anus and coat do not contain any black pigment.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Miniature Shar Pei is affectionate, adaptable, playful, confident, calm, independent, regal, and alert.  They are inherently clean and quiet.   Some can be a bit aloof and though they are wise, obedience training requires a confident, consistent authority figure to prevent them from becoming overly dominant.  This breed makes a delightful companion but is very independent with a temperament that will depend highly on how the owner treats the dog.  It is a dog that bonds well with its family and is very devoted.  Daily walks are needed to give the dog some exercise.  During times of increased temperature walks should be shortened as these dogs are somewhat sensitive to the heat.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nMany of this breeds health issues depend upon the lines that the dog comes from.  Dogs with few hereditary issues will tend to be healthier than ones whose parents or grand parents had problems.  One misconception about the health of the Miniature Shar Pei is that its wrinkles lead to skin problems. A healthy dog's wrinkles should not require any special care. The wrinkles can cause other issues, occasionally puppies have so many wrinkles that the excess skin covers the dogs eyes and puts pressure on the eyelids causing them to rub on the cornea.  This symptom is called entropion and can usually be corrected through a process called \"tacking\" where by using stitches to temporarily hold the wrinkles away from the eyes, the puppy is given time to grow into its skin.  In severe cases where tacking is unsuccessful, an operation may be needed to surgically remove the excess skin around the dogs eyes.  Like the larger Standard Shar Pei, Swollen Hocks Syndrome is sometimes seen in this breed and if not treated can lead to Amyloidosis resulting in Kidney Failure.  Other than these few issues the breed tends to be relatively healthy requiring only routine visits to the vet.\n\n\n== Development ==\nOver the past few years the Miniature Shar Pei breed has grown in popularity. The miniature size that has created this gain and which differentiates this breed from the larger standard Shar Pei, comes from a recessive gene found in its DNA.  According to the Miniature Shar Pei Club of America \"This breed is being developed to provide a small, unique, intelligent family companion. Its sturdy, compact size makes this a versatile pet suited to a wide variety of lifestyles.\"   Currently this breed is not classified as its own separate breed by the American Kennel Club.  Miniature Shar Pei can be registered as a Chinese Shar Pei with the American Kennel Club but must have the litter registered with the AKC by the breeder.\n\n\n== History ==\nThis breed goes back to around 200 BC in China where it was a cross of relatives to the chow chow, mastiff, terrier, and bulldog. Over the years this breed became larger as the mastiff influence began to come out. What many people do not know is that the Miniature actually represents a more accurate build of the breed's true dimensions. Until Shar Pei became AKC recognized, and the larger standard was adopted, those breeding what are now known as Miniature Shar Pei were actually breeding the more original size.  This was recently discovered through the finding of the gene responsible for the miniature size. Before this many thought that the smaller sized dogs were unhealthy or considered to be mistakes. Today Miniature Shar Pei breeders believe that this breed is special unto itself and worthy of approval by the American Kennel Club.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMiniature Shar-Pei Club Of America"}, {"id": 323, "name": "Romanian Mioritic Shepherd Dog", "country": "Romania", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog323", "description": "The Romanian Mioritic Shepherd Dog is a large breed of livestock guardian dog that originated in the Carpathian Mountains of Romania.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe male Mioritic stands about 70\u201375 centimetres (28\u201330 in) tall at the withers with the female slightly smaller at 65\u201370 centimetres (26\u201328 in).

It is a calm and well-mannered dog. As this dog was used as a herd protector, it is very attached to family and goes all the way when protecting those it is attached to.

It descends from crosses between the St. Bernard, Caucasian Shepherd, and Russian Spotted Hound breeds. It contains the physical size, attractiveness and intelligence of a St. Bernard and the awareness and assertive traits of a Caucasian Ovtcharka.The breed is very large and weight is between 45 and 68 kg (100 and 150 lbs). They are known to be a large powerful breed with a gentle temperament, therefore if it is raised properly with training with discipline, the Moscow Watchdog could fit into any environment and be the perfect protective family pet. Unlike its modern St. Bernard counterparts, the breed needs lots of vigorous exercise. They do not drool like many of the other molossers. Until recently, Moscow Watchdogs were very hard to find outside of Russia and former Soviet states, however are now becoming more popular in Europe and have recently reached the United States. The first litter of Moscow Watchdogs was born in US on June 6, 2015. There are currently 27 Moscow Watchdogs living in the United States. \n\n\n== Appearance ==\nRelated to mountain dogs, the Moscow Watchdog, one of the larger dog breeds, stands between 64 and 69 cm (25 and 27 inches) tall and weighs 45 to 68 kg (100 to 150 pounds). They are a muscular dog that has a bulky head and powerful legs. Their coat is thick in a moderate length with the color white and red. Their puffy tail is long enough that it could touch the floor. They are an average shedder and with a well-arched chest, they generally give an impression of firmness and confidence.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Moscow Watchdog is fine in temperament, but it requires training and an owner committed to achieving leader status. In nature, dogs have pack order.  Therefore, when humans live with dogs, it is a good idea for humans to establish themselves as a leader, a higher order than the dogs, so they can make directions and set rules. In this relationship, Moscow Watchdog is known to be a gentle giant, assertive and protective to his family when in danger.\n\n\n== Health concern ==\nMoscow Watchdog is generally a healthy breed but still has a risk to be prone to hip dysplasia and other large breeds\u2019 problems.  Moscow Watchdogs require a fairly large space to move and is not suitable to live in a small apartment. They need regular exercise, such as going for a long walk, jog or run freely at a safe area to stay unstressed and healthy.    Regular grooming with a bristle brush and Bathe or dry shampoo are also necessary.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the period after World War II, Russia needed thousands of guard dogs due to the rising crime . A breed of dog that could adapt to a very low temperature \u221230 \u2013 \u221240 \u00b0C (\u221222 \u2013 \u221240 \u00b0F), snowy environment during winter and to be able to guard nearly everything that was owned by the government, such as warehouses, railroads, labor camps and infrastructure. That was the reason why they started an immense project led by Gen Medvedev. It began in 1946 and lasted a year at the Central School Of Military Kynology, a department of USSR Ministry of Defense. After many years of experiments of crossbreeding purebred dogs, Moscow Watchdog was one of the most successful breeds from Caucasian Ovtcharka and St. Bernard. It provides the mental and physical aspect that they desired.In 1986, the first few Moscow watchdogs were brought to Hungary for breeders to help popularize the breed. Future growth was guaranteed by devoted breeders and also the breed owner, Club Karak\u00e1n. In addition, dozens of breeders from former Soviet states had also work with the breed to ensure their existence for the future. At the time, around 500 Moscow Watchdogs could be found in Hungary.The breed standard was first published in 1985 when it received \"official status\" in the Soviet Union.  In 1992, it was approved by the Federation of the Dog Breeders of Russia and in 1997 the Department of Animal Breeding and Pedigree of The Ministry of Agriculture of Russia. The standard was also approved by the Russian Kennel Club in 1997.\nThe Russian Kennel Club is working with the International Kennel Federation (FCI) to gain official recognition.  Currently, the Moscow Watchdog is considered by the FCI as part of the 2nd group Molosser.  In FCI sanctioned dog shows, they are shown in what is referred to as a \"Special Show.\"  Inside Russia, they are widely shown and a recognized breed.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRussian Cynologycal Federation\nwww.molosserdogs.com"}, {"id": 328, "name": "Moscow Water Dog", "country": "Russia", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog328", "description": "The Moscow Water Dog, also known as the Moscow Diver, Moscow Retriever or Moskovsky Vodolaz, is a little-known dog breed derived from the Newfoundland, Caucasian Shepherd Dog and East European Shepherd. It is now extinct, but was used in the development of the Black Russian Terrier. The Moscow Water Dog was produced only by the Red Star Kennels, the state-operated organization chartered to provide working dogs for the armed services of the Soviet Union.\nAfter World War II, there were very few working dogs in Soviet Union as many had been killed during the war. Some were imported but there were not enough to establish a dedicated breeding programme for a specific breed. The Central Military School of Working Dogs (the Red Star Kennels), under the command of Colonel G. P. Medvedev began working on developing a number of their own specialised breeds by crossing the available stock. A few breeds were established including the Moscow Newfoundland, a cross of German Shepherd Dog and Newfoundland; the Moscow Great Dane, using German Shepherd and Great Dane; the Brudasty Hound, which was an Airedale Terrier and Russian Hound mix; the Moscow Watchdog, a combination of St. Bernard and Caucasian Shepherd Dog; and the Moscow Water Dog.  The most successful breed to come out of the programme was the Black Russian Terrier, which gained international recognition in 1984; it derived from a combination of 14 different breeds including the Moscow Water Dog in the later stages of its development.\nMoscow Water Dogs were bred in Krasnaya Zvezda, Belarus, by interbreeding Newfoundland males with East European Shepherd and Caucasian Shepherd Dog females, and by mating the offspring with each other. They were developed as a water rescue/lifesaving dog, but according to O. Krasnovskaya, \"That was not a good idea as [they] were not willing to save drowning people, but mostly were looking to bite them so this breed was never developed\".\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 329, "name": "Mountain Cur", "country": "United States", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog329", "description": "The Mountain Cur is a type of working dog that is bred specifically for treeing and trailing small game, like squirrel and raccoons. They are also used for hunting and baying big game like bear and wild boar as well as being an all-purpose farm dog. Curs are a member of the Hound group, and the Mountain Cur is one of several varieties of cur. It can also be used as a water dog. Mainly bred in Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee, it has been registered with the United Kennel Club since 1998. The Mountain Cur Breeder's Association was formed in 1957.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Mountain Cur was brought to America nearly two hundred years ago from Europe by the settlers of the mountains in Ohio, Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee, then later Arkansas and Oklahoma, to guard family and property as well as chase and tree game. These dogs enabled the settlers to provide meat and pelts for personal use or trade, making them valuable in the frontier. With the advent of World War II, many of the families who had bred them left rural areas to work in factories in the war effort. By the end of the 1940s the breed was becoming rare.\nFour individuals, Hugh Stephens and Woody Huntsman of Kentucky, Carl McConnell of Virginia, and Dewey Ledbetter of Tennessee are given credit for saving the breed from dying out and setting the Mountain Cur breed standard. In 1956, these four founded the Original Mountain Cur Breeders' Association. Soon after, controversy over the breed standard caused Hugh Stephen and Carl McConnell to leave the OMCBA to found the Stephen Stock Mountain Cur Association.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the Mountain View Cur was developed from the Mountain Cur by Michael and Marie Bloodgood of Afton, New York.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nMountain Curs are short-coated dogs which come in blue, yellow, brown, or brindle coloration. Some individuals will also show white markings on the face or chest. The weight is usually between 30 and 60 pounds, and height is 18-26 inches for males and 16-24 inches for females.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Mountain Cur is intelligent, easily trained, and neither vicious nor shy. They are known to try to please their masters. They are not, however, dogs to be trifled with; historically many a cur died fighting to protect their family from attackers or dangerous predators.\nThese curs were bred to work, and if deprived of the opportunity to hunt, guard, or work around a farm they will grow anxious and bored. When they have a job to do, these dogs are generally happy and obedient, and are able to get along well with children and other pets.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nMountain Curs can live up to 14\u201316 years, and there are no reported breed-specific health issues.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMountain Cur Dog Photos\nOriginal Mountain Cur Breeders Association \nRare Breed Network\nUnited Kennel Club\nContinental Kennel Club\nMountain Cur Dog Breed Information"}, {"id": 330, "name": "Mucuchies", "country": "Venezuela", "type": "", "picture": "dog330", "description": "Mucuch\u00ed (Venezuelan Sheepdog) is a dog breed from Venezuela (specifically from Sierra Nevada de M\u00e9rida). The dogs have a short coat with feathering along their limbs. The coat color is either white or white with splashes of colors such as honey or tan, or shades of black and gray.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nA mucuch\u00ed is a relatively large (30\u201350 kg) dog, sturdily built, of pleasant appearance and a certain grandeur, brown eyes of kindly expression. It is an animal of great energy and despite having developed the instinct of monitoring, which always keeps it on alert, it is deliberate and safe.\n\nColor: pure white, white with patches in various shades of honey color and white with black spots. Red or reddish spots, gray spots, tan with white spots or black with white spots are considered defects.\nSize: are between 55.9 and 71.1 cm (22-28 inches).\nWeight: for the adult specimens the weight should be 33-50 kg for the male and 30\u201337 kg for the female.\nHead: Long, of wedge-shape (triangular), 20 to 23 cm from the external occipital protuberance to the tip of the nose; rounded forehead, slightly wrinkled brow furrows.\nEars: medium-sized, triangular in shape but rounded at the tips, placed slightly above the parallel line of the eyes, tight to the head and that only rises in reactions of attention and alert.\nEyes: oblique, brown, expressive with well pigmented eyelids.\nLips: thin and glued (not pendulous), lined black, like the nose, which is always black.\nGill and Ruff: well developed but not exaggerated.\nNeck: short, strong and muscular.\nBody: shoulders well placed obliquely, wide and straight back, prominent haunches with the rump declined slightly; ribs more flat than arched; deep chest. Spine arched up or down is considered a defect.\nTail: longer than the hocks, with abundant fur, palm or fan shaped. It remains low at rest; raised (never reaching full circle) when alert.\nCoat: rich and thick (woolly), strong hairs, can be straight or slightly wavy.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nMucuchies are believed to descend from dogs introduced by Spanish conquerors at the end of the 16th century as watchdogs and herders. It is possibly a descendant of the Spanish Mastiff, the Pyrenean Mastiff, Algerian Mastiff, the Atlas Shepherd Dog or Aidi, and the Great Pyrenees. Over the years these dog breeds mixed, ultimately creating a powerful and versatile working dog. Others suggest that Mucuchies were deliberately bred by veterinarian Dr. Wilender Ferrari.\nIts importance in Venezuelan history came after Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar reached the town of Mucuch\u00edes in Venezuelan Andes of M\u00e9rida state during his struggle for Venezuelan independence and subsequently adopted a dog of this breed.\nDuring 1926-27 Mucuchies were found throughout Venezuela. After the wide distribution of the breed, its purity and quality was in serious decline in the early part of the 20th century. In 1961 a club was created to preserve the breed, and by 1964 it was declared the Venezuelan \"National Dog\". The club then appears to have disbanded, which would mean an uncertain future for the breed.\nIn 2008, in order to preserve the national breed, MINTUR (el Ministerio del Poder Popular para el Turismo), led at the time by Titina Azuaje, approved the creation of the Fundaci\u00f3n Nevado (Funev), with six of these dogs transferred to the Waraira Repano Cable Car System in El \u00c1vila National Park, where similar environmental conditions to the Andes exist. The success of this effort led President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to encourage and amplify this program.\n\n\n== Qualities ==\n\nMucuch\u00edes were originally shepherd and a guard dogs. The first quality was lost due to a shortage of cattle in the Andean moors, but it retained its guardian aspects. It has a strong character, is very active, gentle and loving towards its family, but may react violently against strangers unless trained and socialized properly.\nIt should always have double spur on the hind legs and a single in the front.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Mucuch\u00edes are very emotional, intelligent and active dogs. Socialization and training are necessary. It can be aggressive with strangers.\n\n\n=== Care ===\nIt should be given daily walks, preferably taken at a trot. It requires a wide area where to run and play. Not much grooming is required.\n\n\n== Famous Mucuchies ==\n\nNevado was Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar's dog, and was with him during voyages and battles until his death.When arriving at a local mansion, the Hacienda Moconoque, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar was received by \"Nevado\", which despite being a puppy was not intimidated before the weapons and threats of the army men. De Mendoza explained that Bol\u00edvar was surprised at the dog's courage, who did not allow the group to enter the hacienda until its master came out. Nevado accompanied him throughout the campaign, fought in several countries and often saved his life. One popular story tells that Nevado was abducted by the royalist army, which did not kill him because they thought the dog would lead them to Bolivar. However, the dog escaped and reunited with Bolivar. Nevado was killed by a spear during the Battle of Carabobo on 24 June 1821, which sealed Venezuela's independence from the Spanish Crown. Nevado also appears in various historical paintings and a known statue which features him alongside the Indian Tinjac\u00e1 in Mucuch\u00edes.\n\nSim\u00f3n is Cristina Fernandez's dog, a gift to her from a brother of Hugo Chavez.\nProgreso and Esperanza, Henrique Capriles's dogs, donated during his 2012 presidential campaign in M\u00e9rida.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAkbash Dog\nGreat Pyrenees\nKuvasz\nMaremma Sheepdog\nPyrenean Mastiff\nPolish Tatra Sheepdog\nSlovak Cuvac\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links =="}, {"id": 331, "name": "Mudhol Hound", "country": "India", "type": "", "picture": "dog331", "description": "The Mudhol Hound, also known as Caravan Hound is an Indian breed of dog of the sight hound type. The feathered variety is commonly referred to as a Pashmi. It is also called Karwani. It is a common pet amongst villagers in India's Karnataka state, who use it for hunting and guarding.\nThe Kennel Club of India (KCI) and Indian National Kennel Club (INKC) recognize the breed under different breed names. The KCI registers it as a Caravan Hound while the INKC uses the name Mudhol Hound.The postage stamp with face value of Rs.5.00 was released by Indian Postal Department on 9 January 2005, together with three other dogs, the Himalayan Sheep Dog (Rs. 5.00), Rampur Hound (Rs. 5.00) and Rajapalayam (Rs. 15.00), in recognition of the Mudhol Hound.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Mudhol or Caravan hound has well-defined characteristics. The head is long and narrow, broad between the ears with a tapering muzzle. The jaws are long and powerful, with a scissors bite. The nose is large and black. The ears are pendulous and hang close to the skull. The eyes are large and oval in shape, from dark to hazel. The expression is a piercing gaze. The neck is long, clean, and muscular, and fits well into the shoulders. The forelegs are long and straight. The back is long, broad and well-muscled. The loins are wide and deep. The chest is strong and deep with well sprung ribs. The abdomen is tucked in. The hind quarters appear wide and well-muscled. The tail is set on low, strong at the base and tapering, quite long and carried in a natural curve. The gait is high-footed, flexing all four legs, but should not be hackneyed. There are two coat varieties\u2014one with an entirely smooth coat and the other with silky featherings on the ears, legs, and tail. Acceptable colours are fawn, fallow, red, cream, black, and mouse-grey, or any of these colours broken with a minimal amount of white.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe breed is above all a working hound, capable of providing an excellent performance in the field on a consistent basis, under gruelling conditions that would decimate most other dogs. They are elegant, graceful and courageous. Its physical strength couples with great speed and plenty of stamina to allow it to catch and kill several types of game, from hare to blackbuck, over rough country. It is not an ideal dog for the apartment dweller, as it needs a great deal of space and exercise; although if arrangements are made to exercise the dog regularly in a sufficiently large, safely fenced area, it may do well in a flat or any other dwelling.\nThe breed, if treated with kindness and respect, can be exceptionally loyal. They are not very friendly, and do not like to be touched by strangers. They make  reasonable watch dogs as they can be very protective. They should be treated consistently and respectfully because otherwise they may develop a nervous or vicious nature\u2014either of which are difficult to live with.\n\n\n=== Breeding ===\nAbout 750 families in and around Mudhol town of Karnataka are raising this breed for marketing the puppies.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Caravan was introduced to the Deccan Plateau of western India from Central Asia and Arabia, and can thus be considered a direct descendant of the Saluki or T\u0101z\u012b. This region covers parts of the states of Karnataka, Maharashtra, and, to a lesser degree, Andhra Pradesh. The breed is popular in and around Mudhol Taluk of Karnataka and thus the breed got the name Mudhol hound.Shrimant Rajesaheb Malojirao Ghorpade of Mudhol (1884-1937) of the Mudhol State is credited with reviving the Mudhol hound. He noticed local tribal people called Bedar (Fearless); also called Berad (not - crying) using these hounds for hunting. Using selective breeding, he was able to restore the royal Mudhol hound. On a visit to England in the early 1900s, the Maharaja of Mudhol State presented King George V a pair of hounds, which popularized the Mudhol hound breed.The Indian Army has expressed its desire to use the Mudhol sight hound for surveillance and border protection duties. It has obtained six Mudhol dogs for testing at the  Army's Remount Veterinary Corps at Meerut. The dogs were bred after selection, at the Canine Research and Information Centre in Thimmapur near Mudhol in Bagalkot district of Karnataka.

It is closely related to the Puli and Pumi, from which it was separated in the 1930s. Today, the Mudi is bred for work, sport, companionship, and show.  They continue to be used in herding, as well as participating in a variety of dog sports.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Mudi was first discovered as a breed in 1936 by Dr. Dezso Fenyes in Hungary, where it became known as the \"driver dog.\" Its origin reaches well back into the 15th and 18th centuries, but the exact time is hard to pinpoint. Mudis nearly disappered shortly after their recognition, as many were killed during World War II. The breed became recognized by The Federation Cynologique Internationale in 1966, followed by the United Kennel Club in 2006.   The Mudi still actively herds in Hungary with Hungarian shepherds and with flocks of up to 500 sheep. \n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nMudi usually weigh 18 to 29 pounds (8.2 to 13.2 kg) and stand 15 to 19 inches (38 to 48 cm) high at the withers. The coat is medium wavy or curly, with short hair on the face and legs. The accepted colors are black (fekete), brown (barna), white (feh\u00e9r), Fawn (fak\u00f3), Ash (hamvas), and Cifra (marbling of black and gray.) Mudis are born with various lengths of tails from bobtails to long full length tails. Dogs born with short or natural bobtail will be indicated on the FCI pedigree as docking is prohibited.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Mudi is a versatile farm dog that can hunt, exterminate rodents, and act as a capable herding dog and flock guardian. They are great for alerting and protecting their home and family. They have a high pitched bark and can be very loud. There are three herding dogs native to Hungary: the Puli, Pumi and Mudi, all having similar characteristics. The Mudi is a clever, keen, active dog who becomes very attached to its owner and family. The Mudi may be aloof with strangers and early socialization is recommended.\n\n\n=== Exercise and activities ===\nThe Mudi is a very active breed. They need to be taken on a daily, long, brisk walks or jogs. In addition, they will benefit from a large safe area where they can run free. They need a lot of running and other exercises to be in good condition. They love to play and will excel in all kinds of dog sports such as Frisbee. The Mudi can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, Rally obedience, Schutzhund, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Mudi that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n=== Health problems ===\nThe Mudi is a generally healthy breed. Some health problems that have been seen in the Mudi include, hip dysplasia, epilepsy, cataracts, elbow dysplasia and patellar luxation. \n\n\n=== Living conditions ===\nThe Mudi can live in an apartment if it is sufficiently exercised. However, they need space to run and play and are more suited to a larger space. They are moderately active indoors and will do best with at least a large yard. This breed can live outdoors.\n\n\n=== Life expectancy ===\nAbout 13\u201314 years.  Although, two Mudis in Canada lived to 17.5 years of age.\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\nWith its short coat, the Mudi is generally easy to groom. The Mudi's coat sheds dirt and hair, however, does not require frequent bathing. A weekly brushing is sufficient and their coat does not need trimming. The Mudi sheds in the spring and does not fully regain his coat until the end of summer. Their nails should be cut every few weeks as needed, along with basic care. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMudi Association of Canada\n\"* Mudi (Dog) - Definition,meaning - Online Encyclopedia\".

This massive breed is often used as a guard and defender of family and property due to their protective instincts and their fearsome appearance.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nAccording to the American Kennel Club (AKC) standard, male Neapolitan Mastiffs should measure 26\u201331 inches (66\u201379 cm) at the withers, weigh 130\u2013155 pounds (60-70 kg), while females should measure 24\u201329 inches (61\u201374 cm) and weigh 110\u2013130 pounds (50\u201360 kg). Body length should be 10\u201315% greater than height.\nThe Neapolitan Mastiff is large and powerful. Their bodies are covered in loose skin with a coat that can either be black, blue, mahogany or tawny.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe Neapolitan Mastiff is fearless and extremely protective of its home and family. They prefer to be with their family. The Neapolitan Mastiff rarely barks unless under provocation, renowned for sneaking up on intruders as opposed to first alerting them of its presence.\nNeapolitan Mastiffs, as a breed, are extremely intelligent dogs with a tendency to be independent thinkers. They learn quickly, which is both good and bad, since this guardian breed needs extensive proper socialization to learn to accept strangers, especially within the home; without proper early socialization and training, these dogs are likely to become aggressive towards strangers and unfamiliar dogs.\nNeapolitans must be well socialized with people (especially children), as they are large, powerful dogs and do not always know their own strength. Additionally, young children have young friends, and even with extensive socialization and training, Neapolitans will be wary of strangers and protective of their family, which can be disastrous for small children. Most of the time, they will protect their owners with their lives.\nAdditional protection training is unnecessary because they are natural guard dogs and always have been. As with every breed, obedience training is very important. The Neapolitan is very tolerant of pain due to the breed's early fighting background and the fact the skin is loose on the body, so it is important to routinely check for health problems, as a Neapolitan may not behave differently when injured or ill. They also are renowned for drooling especially after drinking or if they get excited.\nThe Neapolitan Mastiff has a low activity level, even as a puppy. Visits to dog parks should be minimal, considering they can be aggressive to other dogs they are not familiar with. The ideal environment for this breed is in its home with a large yard and a fence five or six feet high.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThe Neo has some specific health concerns. The most common is Cherry eye.\nOthers include:\n\nHip dysplasia\nEctropion\nEntropion\nElbow dysplasia\nSebaceous adenitis\nProgressive retinal atrophy\nHypothyroidism\nCardiomyopathy\nGastric dilatation volvulus (bloat)\nSkin infections between skin folds called pyoderma\nAnesthetic sensitivityLike most giant breeds, the Neapolitan Mastiff has a relatively short life expectancy. UK breed club surveys puts the average at 7 years, with 1 in 6 living to 9 years or more.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Neapolitan Mastiff is one of the Molosser type of dogs, which probably descend from a common stock; whether this was the Molossus attested in antiquity is controversial.\nDespite centuries of popularity throughout Europe, this type of dog was almost lost after World War II. Soon after the war, Italian painter Piero Scanziani established a breeding kennel to turn the Mastiff-type dogs of Italy into a formal breed which was then named the Neapolitan Mastiff and English Mastiff was used to help in this process.The original prototype for the Neapolitan Mastiff was a dog named Guaglione. Originally, \u201cCani de presa\u201d were observed shsbsbby Swiss journalist Piero Scanzani and veterinarian Ruggero Soldati at the first exhibiton show Oct 12, 1946 at the Castel dell\u2019Ovo in NThe eight dogs all varied in size and color - from black, blue and brindle and in phenotype - but one in particular caught the eye of Scanzini - a dog known as Guaglione\n.\nScanziani\u2019s appreciation of Guaglione was not shared by the judges from the north - in a latitudinally conscious country. The judges were working closely with zoologist Professor Giuseppe Solaro, who was instrumental in starting a number of Italian breed standards including the Maltese, Bracco Italians and Maremma Sheepdog among others\n.\nScanziani had hoped they would consider Gugalione\u2019s type to be reminiscent of the ancient molossers of the past and is famed by writing - \u201cIn Vain I showed them Guaglione and spoke of the old molossus\u201d - but \u201cthe most authoritative of the judges decreed: \u201cthe breed is missing, and even the dog is missing\u201d\n.\nThis last statement can arguably be considered the death blow for a breed already on the brink of extinction. To provide substance was to give the breed Type, and the dog moved away from the Cane de Presa or catch dog - to the Mastino Napoletano\n.\nScanziani was so enamored by Guglione that he purchased him in 1949 at 5yo and he became the patriarch of the breed. Registering him as the first Mastino and model for the first breed standard drafted by himself and Soldati. Guglione became the first Italian champion in 1951\n.\nOf particular note is that Soldano the famous judge who was so dismissive of Guaglione and the seven other dogs exhibited in 1946 later produced his own version of the Mastino standard\n.\nNeapolitan Mastiffs were also trained to bait bulls, bears and jaguars.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nNeapolitan Mastiff\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNeapolitan Mastiff at Curlie"}, {"id": 336, "name": "Nepali Hill Dog (page does not exist)", "country": "Nepal", "type": "", "picture": "dog336", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 337, "name": "Newfoundland (dog)", "country": "Canada", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog337", "description": "The Newfoundland dog is a large working dog. They can be either black, brown, or white-and-black (called Landseer). However, in Dominion of Newfoundland, before it joined confederation to Canada, the only correct colours are either black or Landseer.  They were originally bred and used as a working dog for fishermen inNewfoundland (which is now part of Canada). They are known for their giant size, intelligence, tremendous strength, calm dispositions, and loyalty. Newfoundland dogs excel at water rescue/lifesaving because of their muscular build, thick double coat, webbed feet, and innate swimming abilities.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Newfoundlands ('Newfs' or 'Newfies') have webbed feet and a water-resistant coat. Males normally weigh 65\u201380 kg (143\u2013176 lb), and females 55\u201365 kg (121\u2013143 lb), placing them in the \"Giant\" weight range; but some Newfoundland dogs have been known to weigh over 90 kg (200 lb) \u2013 and the largest on record weighed 120 kg (260 lb) and measured over 1.8 m (6 ft) from nose to tail, ranking it among the largest of dog breeds. They may grow up to 56\u201376 cm (22\u201330 in) tall at the shoulder.The American Kennel Club (AKC) standard colors of the Newfoundland dogs are black, brown, grey, and white-and-black (sometimes referred to as Landseer). Other colors are possible but are not considered rare or more valuable. The Kennel Club (KC) permits only black, brown, and white/black; the Canadian Kennel Club (CKC) permits only black and white/black. The \"Landseer\" pattern is named after the artist, Sir Edwin Henry Landseer, who featured them in many of his paintings. F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) consider the ECT Landseer (\"European Continental Type\") to be a separate breed. It is a taller, more narrow white dog with black markings not bred with a Newfoundland.\n\nThe Newfoundland's extremely large bones give it mass, while its large musculature gives it the power it needs to take on rough ocean waves and powerful tides. These dogs have huge lung capacity for swimming extremely long distances and a thick, oily, and waterproof double coat which protects them from the chill of icy waters. The double coat makes the dog hard to groom, and also causes a lot of shedding to occur. The droopy lips and jowls make the dog drool, especially in high heat.\nIn the water, the dog's massive webbed paws give it maximum propulsion. The swimming stroke is not an ordinary dog paddle. Unlike other dogs, the Newfoundland moves its limbs in a down-and-out motion giving more power to every stroke.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Newfoundland dog is known for its calm and docile nature and its strength. They are highly loyal and make ideal working dogs. It is for this reason that this breed is known as \"the gentle giant\". International kennel clubs generally describe the breed as having a sweet temper. It typically has a deep bark and is easy to train if started young. They are wonderfully good with children, but small children can get accidentally leaned on and knocked down. Newfoundlands are ideal companions in the world of therapy and are often referred to as the nanny dog. The breed was memorialized in \"Nana\", the beloved guardian dog in J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan. The Newfoundland, in general, is good with other animals, but its size can cause problems if it is not trained.\nA Newfoundland's good, sweet nature is so important, it is listed in the Breed Standards of many countries; dogs exhibiting poor temperament or aggression are disqualified from showing and should never be used to breed. The breed standard in the United States reads that \"Sweetness of temperament is the hallmark of the Newfoundland; this is the most important single characteristic of the breed.\"\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nThere are several health problems associated with Newfoundlands. Newfoundlands are prone to hip dysplasia (a malformed ball and socket in the hip joint). They also get Elbow dysplasia, and cystinuria (a hereditary defect that forms calculi stones in the bladder).  Another genetic problem is subvalvular aortic stenosis (SAS). This is a common heart defect in Newfoundlands involving defective heart valves. SAS can cause sudden death at an early age. It is similar to having a heart attack.  It is common that \"Newfs\" live to be 8 to 10 years of age; 10 years is a commonly cited life expectancy. But, Newfoundlands can live up to 15 years old.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Newfoundland shares many physical traits with Mastiffs and Molosser type dogs, such as the St. Bernard and English Mastiff, including stout legs, massive heads with very broad snouts, a thick bull neck, and a very sturdy bone structure. In fact, many St. Bernard Dogs have Newfoundland Dog ancestry. Newfoundlands were brought and introduced to the St. Bernard breed in the 18th century when the population was threatened by an epidemic of distemper. They share many characteristics of many mountain dog breeds such as the Great Pyrenees.\nThe Newfoundland breed originated on Newfoundland, and is descended from a breed indigenous to the island known as the lesser Newfoundland, or St. John's dog. DNA analysis confirms that Newfoundlands are closely related to other Canadian retrievers, including the Labrador, Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, Golden Retrievers, and Flat Coated Retrievers.  The Molosser-like appearance of the Newfoundland are a result of an introduction of Mastiff blood, possibly from breeding with Portuguese Mastiffs brought to the island by Portuguese fishermen beginning in the 16th century.\nBy the time colonization was permitted in Newfoundland in 1610, the distinct physical characteristics and mental attributes had been established in the Newfoundland breed.  In the early 1880s, fishermen and explorers from Ireland and England traveled to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, where they described two main types of working dog. One was heavily built, large with a longish coat, and the other medium-sized in build \u2013 an active, smooth-coated water dog. The heavier breed was known as the Greater Newfoundland, or Newfoundland. The smaller breed was known as the Lesser Newfoundland, or St. John's dog. The St. John's dog became the founding breed of the modern retrievers. Both breeds were used as working dogs to pull fishnets, with the Greater Newfoundland also being used to haul carts and other equipment.\nBecause of that, they were part of the foundation stock of the Leonberger (which excelled at water rescue and was imported by the Canadian government for that purpose); and the now extinct Moscow Water Dog, a failed attempt at creating a lifesaving dog by the Russian state kennel\u2014the unfortunate outcross with the Caucasian Ovcharka begat a dog more adept at biting than rescuing.\nMany tales have been told of the courage displayed by Newfoundlands in adventuring and lifesaving exploits. Over the last two centuries, this has inspired a number of artists, who have portrayed the dogs in paint, stone, bronze, and porcelain. One famous Newfoundland was a dog named Seaman, who accompanied American explorers Lewis and Clark on their expedition.\nThe breed's working role was varied. Another famous all-black Newfoundland performed as the star attraction in Van Hare's Magic Circus from 1862 and for many years thereafter in one of England's founding circus acts, traveling throughout Europe. The circus dog was known as the \"Thousand Guinea Dog Napoleon\" or \"Napoleon the Wonder Dog.\" The circus owner, G. Van Hare, trained other Newfoundland dogs to perform a steeplechase routine with baboons dressed up as jockeys to ride them. Nonetheless, his \"wizard dog\" Napoleon was his favorite and held a special position in the Magic Circus. Napoleon would compete at jumping against human rivals, leaping over horses from a springboard, and dancing to music.Napoleon the Wonder Dog became a wildly popular act in London from his debut at the Pavilion Theatre on April 4, 1862, and onward until his untimely death many years later when he slipped and fell during a circus practice session. At the peak of his fame, his performance was described in London's Illustrated Sporting News and Theatrical and Musical Review as follows: \"Synopsis of his entertainment:-- He spells his own name with letters' also that of the Prince of Wales; and when he is asked what he would say of her Most Gracious Majesty, he puts down letters to form \"God save the Queen.\" He plays any gentleman a game of cards and performs the celebrated three-card trick upon which his master backs him at 100 to 1. Also \"The Disappearance,\" a la Robin. He performs in a circus the same as a trick horse, en libert\u00e9, giving the Spanish trot to music, also leaping over bars, through balloons, with numerous other tricks of a most interesting character.\" When Napoleon the Wonder Dog died, as a result of a circus accident at the age of 11 years old, his passing was announced in a number of British newspapers, including the Sheffield Daily Telegraph, which mentioned the loss on May 5, 1868, as follows:  \"DEATH OF A CELEBRATED FOUR-FOOTED ARTISTE. -- Mr. Van Hare's renowned dog, Napoleon, designated 'The Wizard Dog,' died on 24th ult., aged twelve years.  He was a noble specimen of the Newfoundland breed (weighing near 200 lbs.) for which he took the prize at the first Agricultural Hall Dog Show.  Besides his magnificent appearance and symmetry, he was the most extraordinary sagacious and highly-trained animal ever known.  He is now being preserved and beautifully mounted by the celebrated naturalist, Mr. Edwin Ward. -- Era.\"The breed prospered in the United Kingdom, until 1914 and again in 1939, when its numbers were almost fatally depleted by wartime restrictions. Since the 1950s there has been a steady increase in numbers and popularity, despite the fact that the Newfoundland's great size and fondness for mud and water makes it unsuitable as a pet for many households.William Withering, famous for his book on the use of Dropsy published in 1785, lived at Edgbaston Hall, Birmingham between 1786 and 1799. While there, he bred  Newfoundland Dogs. There is very little else on his experiments with these dogs. His daughter Charlotte married a Beriah Botfield and they had a painting in Norton Hall by Samuel Cox of Daventry painted about 1830-1840 called \"Portrait of Lion, a Newfoundland Dog, and Juba, a Pug Dog of Mrs. Botfield's. This hung in the north front of Norton Hall. This painting would have been made around the same time that Landseer painted his portrait of Lion, the Newfoundland Dog. (See 'Catalogue of Pictures in the possession of Beriah Botfield esq.at Norton Hall' published in London in 1848.\n\n\n=== Rescues ===\n\nDuring the Discovery Channel's second day of coverage of the AKC Eukanuba National Championship on December 3, 2006, anchor Bob Goen reported that Newfoundlands exhibit a very strong propensity to rescue people from water. Goen stated that one Newfoundland alone once aided the rescue of 63 shipwrecked sailors. Today, kennel clubs across the United States host Newfoundland Rescue Demonstrations, as well as offering classes in the field. Many harbor boat tours in St. John's have a dog on board for local charm as well as for passenger safety.\n\nAn unnamed Newfoundland is credited for saving Napoleon Bonaparte in 1815. During his famous escape from exile on the island of Elba, rough seas knocked Napoleon overboard. A fisherman's dog jumped into the sea, and kept Napoleon afloat until he could reach safety.\nIn 1828, Ann Harvey of Isle aux Morts, her father, her brother, and a Newfoundland Dog named Hairyman saved over 160 Irish immigrants from the wreck of the brig Despatch.\nIn 1881 in Melbourne, Australia, a Newfoundland named Nelson helped rescue Thomas Brown, a cab driver who was swept away by flood waters in Swanston Street on the night of 15 November. While little is known about what became of Nelson, a copper dog collar engraved with his name has survived and 130 years after the rescue it was acquired by the National Museum of Australia and is now part of the National Historical Collection.\nIn the early 20th century, a dog that is thought to have been a Newfoundland saved 92 people who were on the SS Ethie which was wrecked off of the Northern Peninsula of Newfoundland during a blizzard. The dog retrieved a rope thrown out into the turbulent waters by those on deck, and brought the rope to shore to people waiting on the beach. A breeches buoy was attached to the rope, and all those aboard the ship were able to get across to the shore including an infant in a mailbag. Wreckage of the ship can still be seen in Gros Morne National Park. E. J. Pratt's poem \"Carlo\", in the November 1920 issue of The Canadian Forum, commemorates this dog.\nIn 1995, a 10-month-old Newfoundland named Boo saved a hearing-impaired man from drowning in the Yuba River in Northern California. The man fell into the river while dredging for gold. Boo noticed the struggling man as he and his owner were walking along the river. The Newfoundland instinctively dove into the river, took the drowning man by the arm, and brought him to safety. According to Janice Anderson, the Newfoundland\u2019s breeder, Boo had received no formal training in water rescue.Further evidence of Newfoundlands' ability to rescue or support life-saving activities was cited in a recent article by the BBC.  The breed continues in that role today, along with the Leonberger, Labrador Retriever and Golden Retriever dogs; they are used at the Italian School of Water Rescue Dogs, Scuola Italiana Cani Salvataggio, SICS, founded by Ferruccio Pilenga.\n\n\n== Famous Newfoundlands ==\n\nAdam: Seaward's Blackbeard: 1984 Best in Show winner at the Westminster Dog Show\nBashaw (Matthew Cotes Wyatt): The Earl of Dudley's favourite dog, a sculpture by Matthew Cotes Wyatt can be seen at the Victoria and Albert museum in London\nBeckham: Matt Murray\u2019s dog\nBilbo: a lifeguard Newfoundland on Sennen beach in Cornwall\u2014credited with saving three lives.\nBoatswain: pet of English poet Lord Byron and the subject of his poem \"Epitaph to a Dog\".

Bred from Border Collies, Heading Dogs are a sturdy, long-legged and even-haired breed. They are generally black and white in color, but may also be tan.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe New Zealand Heading Dog is descended from the Border Collie, a breed of dog originally from the Scottish border. Early settlers brought these dogs to New Zealand to herd sheep, then went on to breed more specified dogs. Due to the Border Collie's long hair, they were bred with shorter haired dogs to create a breed that was better suited to the local environment.The New Zealand Heading Dog has since been an integral part of sheepdog trials, which began in New Zealand as early as 1867 in Wanaka. The competitive dog sport involves herding sheep around a field and into enclosures.\n\n\n== Description ==\nNew Zealand Heading Dogs are very aware of their surroundings and are able to adapt to quick movements that are in their line of sight, suiting their shepherding requirements. These types of dogs are specifically bred and trained to work in farms to circle sheep. They are medium to large dogs with long, smooth, straight hair. New Zealand Heading Dogs are often black and white, but some may be tan or other colors. The breed requires an agrarian environment and are generally not intended to be kept as house pets.

It was originally thought to have originated from the work of one of the Dukes of Norfolk, but this theory was disproven after being in doubt during the later part of the 19th century. The term was used to designate springer type spaniels that were neither Sussex nor Clumber Spaniels, and attempts were made to use it to specify a breed that would later become known as the English Springer Spaniel.\nWith a liver-and-white or black-and-white coat, the Norfolk Spaniel was described as being a large cocker spaniel. The Spaniel Club set out a breed standard for Norfolk Spaniels, but specimens of the breed varied greatly across England. Members of the breed were difficult to train, but formed a strong attachment with their owners and were useful for hunting both on land and in water. The breed ceased to exist after 1903, when it was rolled into the new English Springer Spaniel breed created by The Kennel Club to contain all spaniels of this type.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Norfolk Spaniel was believed to have come about from a cross of spaniels with the Black and Tan Terrier, which was cultivated by an unspecified Duke of Norfolk. However, later historians disagree with this theory, saying that the Duke of Norfolk's spaniels were of the King Charles type and that terrier stock had nothing to do with the origins of the Norfolk Spaniel. The theory of the Duke of Norfolk-based origins of the Norfolk Spaniel was thought disproved by the investigation of James Farrow, a 19th-century spaniel breeder, who wrote to Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk in order to find out the truth about the origins of the breed. The Duke responded, denying any connection to the breed, although he did state that his grandfather, Henry Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk, owned Sussex Spaniels. The letter from the Duke was printed in The Kennel Gazette in 1899. An alternative origin was proposed by Rawdon Briggs Lee in volume two of his 1897 work A History and Description of the Modern Dogs of Great Britain and Ireland. Lee argued that the Norfolk Spaniel was descended from a crossing of a curly-coated water spaniel and a Sussex Spaniel or another strain of land spaniel.In the 18th century, spaniels were split into three categories: land spaniels, water spaniels and toy spaniels. The land spaniels were split into two further types, the cocker spaniel and the springer spaniel. It was within the springer spaniel type that the Norfolk Spaniel was placed, along with the Sussex Spaniel and the Clumber Spaniel. By the 1860s, the breed was described as the \"commonest breed in England\", but with a description that varies so much that the only standard point is that they averaged 16 inches (41 cm) in height at the withers.\n\nThe Spaniel Club was formed in 1885, and issued a breed standard for the Norfolk Spaniel, recognising it as a variety of spaniel. However, the general public saw it only as a generic land spaniel. By the 1890s, the breed had become common throughout the counties of England, leading dog writers such as Rawdon Briggs Lee to question the authenticity of its origins, or that the various liver and white spaniels from around England constituted a single breed; \"Personally, I do not consider the liver and white spaniel any particular variety at all, nor do I believe that it has ever been indigenous to Norfolk.\" He states that similar dogs exist in Devonshire that do not trace ancestry to Norfolk, and that liver and white spaniels pre-date the breeding of the Black and Tan Terrier with an ordinary spaniel. F.H.F. Mercer described the breed in 1890 as being \"virtually extinct in its purity\", with its liver and white colours running through any numbers of miscellaneous spaniels, and he too discredits the origins involving the Duke of Norfolk.The Kennel Club (UK) designated all medium legged spaniels which were not Clumber nor Sussex Spaniels as English Springer Spaniels in 1902. The Norfolk Spaniel was included under this designation, with the term \"Norfolk Spaniel\" considered for use to cover these types of spaniels, but ultimately rejected as the Club believed that the breed was always liver and white in colour. The change in terminology was not smooth or immediate, with James Watson in his 1905 work, The Dog Book, still referring to the Norfolk Spaniel as a breed name. In the modern era, the Norfolk Spaniel is thought to be the previous name for the English Springer Spaniel, prior to recognition by The Kennel Club (UK).\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Norfolk Spaniel would typically be unhappy when they were separated from their owners, as they formed a strong attachment. Compared to the springer spaniels of the 19th century, they were more ill-tempered, and could be headstrong and wilful if not successfully broken. Some members of the breed could be noisy, and were described as \"babbling\" and making noise on the hunt in a similar fashion to hounds, while others were far quieter.Its use in hunting was varied, and the breed was useful both on land and in the water. In particular, it became successful in America and towards the beginning of the 20th century were popular in the area around Boston. They were described by the Spaniel Club of America as being as good in the water as the Chesapeake Bay Retriever.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe breed was a freckled white dog with either liver or black markings, the breed standard in 1859 set their measurements at 17\u201318 inches (43\u201346 cm) in height at the withers. It had long legs, feathered ears, a white area on forehead, which was said to \"[add] a great deal to his beauty\",  but there were differences from the English Springer, including a broader skull and shorter neck. It was also compared to the English Setter in its build, shape, and proportions, although it was a much smaller size. While other field spaniels of this era displayed colours other than liver and white or liver and black, the Norfolk did not. The breed-specific qualities varied greatly as in some places the breeding lines were not kept particularly pure, those lines having had stock from Sussex and Clumber Spaniels bred into them.By the end of the 19th century the description of a Norfolk Spaniel had changed slightly, The Spaniel Club breed standard for a Norfolk Spaniel in 1897 was for the animal to have a coat of either black and white or liver and white which was not curly, a reasonably heavy body and legs which are longer than other field spaniels but shorter than the Irish Water Spaniel, a deep chest with long sloping shoulders and strength in the back and loins, as well as features typical of a spaniel such as lobular ears. This standard also included the requirement for the tail to be docked. In brief, the standard described the Norfolk as simply looking like a large cocker spaniel.\n\n\n== References ==\nSpecific\nGeneral"}, {"id": 340, "name": "Norfolk Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog340", "description": "The Norfolk Terrier is a British breed of dog. Prior to gaining recognition as an independent breed in 1964, it was a variety of the Norwich Terrier, distinguished from the \"prick eared\" Norwich by its \"drop ears\" (or folded ears). Together, the Norfolk and Norwich Terriers are the smallest of the working terriers.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Norfolk Terrier has a wire-haired coat which, according to the various national kennel clubs' breed standards, can be \"all shades of red, wheaten, black and tan, or grizzle.\"They are the smallest of the working terriers. They are active and compact, free moving, with good substance and bone. Good substance means good spring of rib and bone that matches the body such that the dog can be a very agile ratter or earth-dog.\nNorfolk terriers are moderately proportioned dogs. A too heavy dog would not be agile. A too refined dog would make it a toy breed. Norfolks generally have more reach and drive and a stronger rear angulation, hence cover more ground than their Norwich cousins. Norfolk have good side gait owed to their balanced angulation front and rear and  their slightly longer length of back.\nThe ideal height is 9 to 10 in (23 to 25 cm) at the withers and weight is about 11 to 12 lb (5.0 to 5.4 kg).\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nNorfolks are described as fearless, but can have an independent streak. They, along with Norwich Terriers and Border Terriers, have the softest temperaments of the Terrier Group. Norfolks work in packs and must get along with other dogs.\nAs companions, they love people and children and do make good pets. Their activity level is generally reflective of the pace of their environment. This breed should not be kept or live outside since they thrive on human contact.\nGenerally, Norfolks are not given to digging but, like any dog, will dig out of boredom when left alone for too long a period. Norfolks are not yappers and are not particularly vocal; however, they will bark when appropriate given their watch-dog tendencies. They generally cohabit well with other household pets when introduced as a puppy. Outdoors, they are natural hunters with a strong prey drive for small vermin.\n\n\n==== Working style ====\n\nNorfolks were originally bred as barn dogs to rid the barn of vermin. Some literature suggest that they were also occasionally used on the hunt to bolt animals of equal size from their den.\nTo some extent they are still used in that capacity in continental Europe. Norfolks are pack animals and hence expected to get along with other dogs while working or in the home. As a pack dog, they take turns working their prey. They are fearless and their courage is incredible. Today, of course, they are household companions and must have an agreeable disposition for living with people.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThe life expectancy of a Norfolk Terrier is 8\u201314 years, with some growing as old as 17 years. Norfolks do have incidences of mitral valve disease, luxating patellas, and incorrect bites (where the teeth do not align with the breed standard, i.e. overshot or undershot).  Norfolks most often have shallow hip sockets and many breedlines are dysplastic.  There has never been a Norfolk Terrier recognized by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) as having \"excellent\" rated hips.  Therefore responsible breeders are testing for hip dysplasia.  Breeders that do not radiograph hips and have them evaluated by either OFA or PennHip, cannot answer questions regarding hip dysplasia in their breeding program.\nNorfolks generally have medium to small litters. Responsible breeders only breed healthy dogs who are of good temperament, good pedigree lineage and best reflect the breed standard. The demand for Norfolk is far greater than the supply. The environment in which they are raised directly impacts the temperament of the puppy for its lifetime.\n\n\n== Care ==\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\nThese breeds have a double coat: a harsh, wiry topcoat and a soft, warm undercoat. Ideally, the coat is combed daily with a steel \"greyhound\" comb, but all that is really necessary for grooming a companion dog is a good combing once a week to remove the loose, dead hairs and prevent matting. As a minimum, the coat is hand stripped once in the Fall and once in the Spring. Clipping or cutting ruins the coat's colours and harsh texture. A Norfolk Terrier can be washed with a dog shampoo when it's dirty.  The breed is considered largely hypoallergenic, although they do shed minimally year-round.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 1880s, British sportsmen developed a working terrier of East Anglia in eastern England. The Norwich Terrier and later the drop-eared variety now known as the Norfolk Terrier, were believed to have been developed by crossing local terrier-like dogs, small, short-legged Irish Terrier breeds and the small red terriers used by the Gypsy ratters of Norfolk (the county in which Norwich the city exists).\nThey were first called the Cantab Terrier when they became fashionable for students to keep in their rooms at Cambridge University in England. Later, they were called the Trumpington Terrier, after Trumpington Street where the breed was further developed at a livery stable. Then, just prior to World War I, a prominent Irish horse rider Frank Jones sold quantities of the short-legged terriers to the United States, so there they were called Jones Terriers. It was Jones who designated the terriers were from Norwich.In 1932, the Norwich was granted acceptance into the English Kennel Club and the first written standard was created.  The American Kennel Club registered the first Norwich Terrier in 1936.  In 1964, The Kennel Club reclassified the drop-ear variety as it its own breed, the Norfolk Terrier, and the prick-eared variety retained the name Norwich Terrier.  The American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club both recognized the division of the Norwich Terrier breed in 1979.  The Norfolk Terrier was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1979.  After many generations, these two breeds have developed as two distinct breeds both in physical looks and in temperament.  Of note, there is literature that suggests that the Norfolk and Norwich were always two distinct breeds and the original mistake was classifying them as one.\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSattler, Victor.

Norrbottenspets was formerly used in hunting squirrels, when squirrel fur was valuable in the beginning of the 20th century and earlier.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe breed originated in Norrbotten, Sweden and Lappland/Kainuuland, Finland, and have been documented as early as the 17th century. Sweden and Finland argue about the true home of the Norrbottenspets, but clearly the dog has spent much time in both countries. The dogs were mainly used as hunting companions. By the end of World War I, the Norbottenspets came close to extinction. Due to the very small number of norrbottens, Sweden closed its studbook in 1948. Although some dogs were preserved, they were in a non-Swedish speaking area and in the far north as a farm dog and companion. Enthusiasts sought out the few remaining dogs and started a successful breeding program between the 1950s and early 1960s. FCI confirmed a new breed standard in 1966 and the official name was confirmed as Norrbottenspets. In 1967 the Swedish Kennel Club accepted the breed for registration and a new standard was written. Finland accepted the standard and began registering dogs in 1973. In Finland these dogs are called Pohjanpystykorva. Immigrant farmers have given the dog an even longer name, Norbottens-skollandehund. There is a great effort in Finland to ensure the health of these fox-like hunting dogs and breeding is highly controlled. Healthy animals, that are only distantly related, are being bred with careful consideration of breeding consultants to create a strong background. Sweden has also had a dramatic impact on the preservation of this breed through strict breeding practices.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Norrbottenspets should be a light spitz dog, yet powerful in appearance. There should be lightness and power reflected in the dog. Males are noticeably more masculine than females, who are smaller and of lighter build. It should give the impression of being alert, spritely, and intelligent. In proportions the Norrbottenspets is slightly taller than long - fit for the original use as a hunter. The tail should curl over the back and rest on the hips.\nThe Norrbottenspets is a physical mixture of endurance, speed, and strength. The ribcage has elements of both speed and strength. Viewed from the front the ribcage is oval and relatively deep, half from height. The ribcage is also relatively long with well-developed last ribs. The arched neck, distinguishable withers and slightly slanting croup makes the lines of the body very speedy. The underline has only a slight tuck up, which with the long ribcage reflects endurance.\nViewing the legs one can see both elements of speed and endurance. The relatively slanting shoulder blades, long upper arms and strong back angulations reflect endurance. The upper thigh forms a nearly 90 degree angle with the pelvis. Small, tight paws belong to an endurance trotter, but relatively long hocks add to the speed in gallop, especially in the start.\nAlthough rare, bobtails do occur naturally, as in the Finnish Spitz and Karelian Bear Dog. This is an automatic disqualification for the showring for the Finnish Spitz and the Norrbottenspets, but not the Karelian. The hunting dog does not need a tail to be very efficient.\n\n\n==== Coat and colour ====\nThe coat is hard, straight, dense, and lies close to the body. It must always have a double coat (although after a coat loss, the undercoat can be rather sparse), and the under-coat is softer than the outer-coat. The ground colour is white, with yellowish red or reddish brown markings. Also, markings of other colours are permitted. The ideal amount of white varies from 30% to nearly 100%, but in extreme cases it should have colour at least on the ears and a small spot near the base of the tail. The more coloured dogs must have a broken saddle(white crossing completely over the shoulders) with the white clearly dominant. Symmetry is not essential in facial colouring, nor is any pattern more correct than another. White on both ears, however, is highly correlated with deafness and is not desirable. Ticking(small spots of 0.25-1.0 cm) is allowed, as is a dark face. There is a gene that is dominant that leads to the dark coloured mask on the face. Often, the mask is accompanied by dark tipping of the guard hairs. For a show dog, symmetrical color can be preferred, but structure and the original purpose are always the most important.\n\n\n==== Piebald colouring ====\n\nPiebald colouring is normally a result of a single gene mutation. Usually a dog that has two copies of the mutated gene is piebald, and a single copy of the gene results in an Irish type spotting. Generally, two copies of the non-mutated gene produces dogs of a solid colour, although a small amount of white is seen. There are a few dogs that do not follow the normal inheritance patterns. The Norrbottenspets is one that does not(data collected by the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon Canada, fall 2008). Another one is the Icelandic Sheepdog. There are a range of piebald colours - blond to red to darker brown. It is the form of the colouring that is important.\n\n\n==== Size ====\nThe difference in size among the Scandinavian Hunting Breeds (Karelian Bear Dog, Finnish Spitz, and Norrbottenspets) promoted by the Finnish Spitz Club (SPJ) is distinct. The Norrbottenspets is clearly the smallest, without being toy breed-like. The standard calls for \"a small and light spitz-dog\". There is overlap in size between the Finnish Spitz and the Norrbottenspets.\nThe Canadian Kennel Club does not disqualify based on standard, but ideal height at the withers: Males- 45 cm (17.7\"), Females- 42 cm (16.5\"). Although the standard does not note this, variation of +/- 2 cm (0.8\") is considered acceptable based on the home standards of Finland and Sweden. The Swedish and Finnish standards indicate that males over 47 cm and females over 44 cm should be disqualified.\nThe weight is approximately 8.5 to 15 kg (19 to 33 lb) for males, and 8 to 14.4 kg (18 to 32 lb) for females. Weight is not mentioned in the standard.\n\n\n=== Movement and gait ===\n\nGait must show smooth, even movements with great drive, covering the ground well. The top-line must stay firm. Legs must be parallel in action. The ears may be back during gaiting. Good strength, balance, co-ordination and agility is needed when working on rough terrain or crossing waterways. A heavy dog would not live long in the woods. Working fitness is of high value \u2013 a large, lethargic dog is to be penalized. It is noteworthy that dogs may gain fat in the winter for warmth along with their heavier coat, but this should not impair their agility or endurance.\n\n\n== Hunting ==\nWhen hunting the dogs use sight, scent, and sound unlike most hounds which tend to specialize as sight or scent hunters. The Norrbottenspets is released into a wooded area where it uses all its senses to find game. Once found the dog will flush the game and begin the chase. The dog will chase the game until it is cornered, treed, or stops. The dog then attempts to hold the game in that location by barking and continuous movement. This barking can be up to 120 barks per minute. In hunting trials the dog is required to bark at 100 barks per minute or faster. The purpose of this rapid barking is to confuse the game and cover any sounds made by the approaching hunter. This allows the hunter to find the game and get close to the game without it knowing the hunter is there.\n\n\n== Dog numbers ==\nThe Norrbottenspets fanciers have been very interested in registering dogs. In Finland, there are about 1200 Norrbottenspets currently living, as of 2008. Canada and the United States have approximately 300 living dogs, as of 2008. Sweden has approximately 1000 dogs, as of 2008. Finland's breeding program has used breeding consultants and computer programs to determine inbreeding coefficients to keep the risk of genetic diseases low given the small population.(Numbers collected by the Finnish Spitz Club, Finland.)\n\n\n== Related Breeds ==\nFinnish Spitz\nKarelian Bear Dog\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nDogs by David Alderton\nNORBOTTENSPETS by the FCI\nSoumen Pystykorvajarjesto - Finska Spetskulubben r.y. 70 vutta by Finnish Spitz Club, Finland\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://www.swedishdog.net/\nhttp://www.ppkry.fi\nhttp://vhknorrbottenspets.weebly.com\nhttp://www.rnbkennels.com\nhttp://www.kennelliitto.fi/EN/etusivu.htm"}, {"id": 342, "name": "North Country Beagle", "country": "United Kingdom", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog342", "description": "The North Country Beagle, Northern Hound or Northern Beagle was a breed of dog that existed in Britain probably until early in the 19th century. The exact date of its extinction is not known; it is likely that it was gradually interbred with other breeds, particularly the modern Beagle, until the genuine North Country Beagle bloodline ceased to exist.\nThe origins of the North Country Beagle are equally unclear. Most writers suggest that it was developed from the Talbot, whose origins are also uncertain, but which some have claimed originated in Normandy. The Talbot was a predominantly white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound. At some point the Talbots were crossed with Greyhounds to give them an extra turn of speed, but they remained comparatively slow dogs that relied more on their nose than speed in the chase.The North Country Beagle was a large, bony hound with a square head, and long trailing ears. Chiefly bred in Yorkshire, it was common in the north of England, but below the River Trent the similar Southern Hound was more abundant. The North Country Beagle was a faster dog; in The British Encyclopedia of 1809, William Nicholson says that the North Country Beagle was kept by the \"dashing class of sportsman\" because it could \"run down a brace [of hare] before dinner\", but although a good scent hound, was probably lacking in this ability when compared to the delicate nose of the Southern Hound. The writer and poet Gervase Markham, who wrote a number of books on animal husbandry in the early 17th century described the North Country Beagle as having:\n\n...a head more slender, with a longer nose, ears and flews more shallow, back broad, belly gaunt, joints long, tail small, and his general form more slender and greyhound-like...\nIn his The Dog, in Health and Disease in 1859, \"Stonehenge\" (the pen name of John Henry Walsh, later editor of The Field) says the two breeds could be differentiated by the large dewlap possessed by the Southern Hound. The Southern Hound seems to have also had a deeper more melodious voice; Markham says the North Country Beagle had \"only a little shrill sweetness\" and lacked depth of tone. How far the Talbot, Northern Hound and Southern Hound were intermixed by the 19th century is impossible to ascertain: while acknowledging that they had once existed as separate breeds, Stonehenge had never seen pure-bred varieties and classified the three breeds together.Both the North Country Beagle and Southern Hound seem to have fallen out of favour during the 18th century as the fashion for less time consuming hunts led to the development of the faster Foxhound. The North Country Beagle may have formed part of the packs kept by southern farmers for rabbit-hunting that would eventually become the nucleus for the modern Beagle breed. Stonehenge says that packs of hounds that resembled the description of the North Country Beagle still existed in Wales, Devon, Yorkshire and Sussex during the 19th century, but he was doubtful as to how far any of these packs truly represented any of the three early hound breeds.Aside from the Beagle other modern hound breeds are believed to have North Country Beagle blood: Harriers and Foxhounds among others. Coonhounds and Bloodhounds are likely to have had more influence from the Southern Hound and Talbot lines, as they are excellent trackers but not as swift as other hound breeds.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nNicholson, William (1809).

It is currently only recognized by its own independent breed club, but by no other major kennel clubs. The dog originates from crosses among German Shepherd Dogs, Siberian Huskies, Samoyeds, Alaskan Malamute  and a variety of Inuit breeds. Although the original stock is Canadian in origin, the breed was developed in the UK.\nEmbark DNA in USA have reported in 2017 that the breeds prominent are German Shepherd, Alaskan Malamute, Siberian Husky, Samoyed and Grey Wolf.  However there are lines that will show no Samoyed or Grey Wolf.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Northern Inuit Dog is of medium to large build, athletic but never racy. Females should be between 23 and 28 inches (58\u201371 cm) tall and weigh around 55\u201384 pounds (25\u201338 kg), while males should be between 25 and 30 inches (58\u201381 cm) tall and weigh 79\u2013110 pounds (36\u201348 kg). The dog should have a double coat and a straight tail (Sickle when excited) \u2013 curly tails are considered a fault.\n\n\n=== Temperament and health ===\nThe Northern Inuit dog is not for the novice owner as they can be very stubborn and are very quick-witted. The owner of a Northern Inuit must show themselves to be a strong leader or be prepared to be the underdog, and be taken advantage of.\nThe breed is quite primitive and are more difficult to train than other, more biddable breeds. Separation anxiety may arise when they are left alone and unsupervised too long, leading to destructive behaviour, but training from a young age will rectify this. Positive training from the onset is a must for this breed. Often, they will do better with another dog for company. Socialisation should begin when vaccinated and throughout as their play can be very rough and misinterpreted.  Desensitisation training also is recommended from puppy stage. \nSome genetic problems have become apparent in Northern Inuit line as with many breeds, including hip dysplasia and epilepsy, all of which are included in the health screen within the society's breeding programme.  All breeding stock are health tested for Hips, Elbows, eyes along with OSD3 (A form of Achondrodysplasia) which tests have been assisted with via AHT (Animal Health Trust) and DM (Degenerative myelopathy) is tested via Laboklin Lab.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere are two stories regarding the history of the Northern Inuit Dog. In the late 1980s, the founder of the breed, Eddie Harrison, bred several mixed-breed rescue dogs of unknown origin or heritage with Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, and a specific bloodline of German Shepherd Dog, to produce the early Northern Inuit dogs. The breed's intent was to create a dog that closely resembled a wolf in appearance while possessing the gentler, more trainable character of the domesticated dog. \nThe other story relating to this breed is that a few Canadian Eskimo Dogs or Labrador Huskys were brought into the UK from the USA in the late 70s or early 80s and crossbred with Alaskan Malamutes and German Shepherd Dogs. This version of events should be substantiated by the publication of importation and quarantine documents; however, this has never happened.\nOver the years various groups have split from the original Northern Inuit Society to form their own breed groups. These have included The Inuit Dog Association, The British Timber dog, Anglo Wulfdog, The British Inuit Dog Club, and The Utonagan Society; the latter has also now splintered into different groups. The Northern Inuit dog is also used within the W.O.L.F World of Lupine federation breeding programme for the Lupine dog.  None of these clubs have been accepted by larger organizations, such as the British Kennel Club.\nThe Northern Inuit Society also have their own NIs Rescue team. The Society breeders will accept their dogs they've bred or the Society Rescue team will assist in assessing and rehoming.\nIn 2011 Northern Inuit dogs were cast as the direwolves in the first season of the HBO TV series Game of Thrones, based on the book series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin.Since 2017 according to latest Embark DNA there is small percentage of grey-Wolf present under 15%.  Variable low content varies from 3-15%, alongside genetic markers for the Samoyed dog.\nThe breed was cast in 2017 to play the character of Rollo (A Wolfdog won by the character Ian Murray played by John Bell) in Starz smash hit show Outlander, which is filmed in Scotland, to be aired November 2018.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTamaskan Dog\nSaarloos wolfdog\nCzechoslovakian Wolfdog\nKunming Wolfdog\nLupo Italiano\n\n\n== External links ==\nNorthern Inuit Society\nAbout.com Northern Inuit Dog Article \n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 344, "name": "Norwegian Buhund", "country": "Norway", "type": "Northern Breed", "picture": "dog344", "description": "The Norwegian Buhund is a breed of dog of the spitz type. It is closely related to the Icelandic Sheepdog and the J\u00e4mthund.  The Buhund is used as an all purpose farm and herding dog, as well as watch dog and a nanny dog.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Name origin ===\nThe name Buhund is derived from the Norwegian word \"bu\", which means homestead, a simple building or mountain hut (where the shepherd lived while looking after his herd in the summer) but can also mean stock, as in livestock, and \"hund\" which means dog. The modern buhund was bred on the rainy western coastlands of Norway  from similar dogs used by Vikings.\n\n\n=== General appearance ===\nThe Norwegian Buhund has a square profile, is a little under medium-sized and sports a high set, tightly curled tail carried over the center of the back. The head is wedge shaped with pricked ears and a black nose. Their back is level with a deep chest.\n\n\n=== Measurements ===\nThe Buhund ranges in size from about 43 to 45 centimeter (17 to 18 inches) with the males being 43-46 cm (17-18\u200b1\u20442 in) and females to 44 cm(17\u200b1\u20442 in) high. The weight range is 14-18 kg (31\u201340 pounds) for males and 12-16 kg (26\u201335 pounds) for females.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nWheaten - Any shade from pale cream to bright orange, with or without dark tipped hairs; as little white as possible; black mask acceptable. Black - Preferably without too much bronzing; with as little white as possible. Areas where white is permissible: a narrow white ring around the neck, a narrow blaze on the face, a small patch of white hairs on the chest, white feet and tip of the tail. Gray dogs with coats similar to the Norwegian Elkhound are sometimes found. In the UK Wolf Sable is also listed in the Kennel Club Breed Standard.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Norwegian Buhund is a highly cheerful and active breed. They do not tire easily and require extensive exercise on a daily basis. The Norwegian Buhund needs to expel its energy and becomes destructive and ill-mannered if ignored or made to stay still frequently. In conjunction with their high level of activity and energy, they are also extremely lovable and are known for their love of children. However, due to their high level of energy and need for intensive training, Norwegian Buhunds should always be supervised, especially around children and the elderly. This breed loves to cuddle and give kisses to their masters and families. They form strong bonds with their owners and therefore are natural watch dogs. This can result in aloof behavior and wariness or anxiety around strangers.  New owners may find this problematic, since the Norwegian Buhund may bark at each new alarming noise or movement. They are communicative and brave, but rarely will snap or bite without provocation.\nThe Norwegian Buhund is highly intelligent. They are extremely headstrong and demonstrate an intense desire to be taught and to learn new things. If appropriate stimulus is not made available, the breed may resort to destructive or inappropriate behavior. The Buhund breed does become bored easily and is known to become restless. Daily exercise is required. This breed is ideal for owners who can dedicate time to exercise and training. With this desire for activity and learning combined with a high level of energy, the Norwegian Buhund makes an excellent agility dog. People who live active lifestyles, or are seeking a dog with which they can become involved in dog sports, will appreciate the personality of the Norwegian Buhund. It is also an ideal dog for people who are athletic and desire a dog to go running, hiking or biking with. This breed makes an excellent companion for a sports enthusiast.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nThe Norwegian Buhund is prone to inherited eye issues and hip dysplasia.\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\nThe Norwegian Buhund breed has a short to medium length coat that does not tangle or mat when shedding. Brushing weekly will be fine, but extra brushing is required when the dog is blowing coat twice a year.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Norwegian Buhund belongs to a large class of dogs called the Spitz type. There are many variations in size, coat and color among the Spitz breeds. In the ancient Gokstad excavation in Norway, where a Viking grave from about the year 900 was opened, skeletons from six dogs of various sizes were found. They would be the antecedents of modern-day Buhunds. When Vikings died, their most cherished and necessary possessions were buried alongside their owners. This was to care for the Vikings in their afterlife. The dogs that protected farms and herded cattle and sheep were expected to continue these duties in Valhalla. It has been documented that these dogs travelled with Vikings on their many journeys, by sea and by land.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNorwegian Buhund at Curlie"}, {"id": 345, "name": "Norwegian Elkhound", "country": "Norway", "type": "Northern Breed", "picture": "dog345", "description": "The Norwegian Elkhound is one of the ancient Northern Spitz-type breed of dog and is the National Dog of Norway. The Elkhound has served as a hunter, guardian, herder, and defender. It is known for its courage in tracking and hunting moose  (or elk) and other large game, such as bears or wolves. The Norwegian Elkhound was first presented at a dog exhibition in Norway in 1877. It is one of the oldest dog breeds, and Elkhounds have been found buried in Viking burial grounds. They make excellent family pets.\nThe AKC breed name \"Norwegian Elkhound\" is a direct translation from its original Norwegian name Norsk Elghund, meaning \"Norwegian moose dog.\" The breed's object in the hunt is to independently track down and hold the moose at bay\u2014jumping in and out toward the moose, distracting its attention, while signaling to the hunters by barking very loudly\u2014until the hunter who follows the sound can arrive to shoot it. The dog will only bark while the moose is stationary, but it can also slowly drive the moose towards shooters lying in wait. The Norwegian Elkhound is also used on a leash. In this mode of hunting, the dog leads the hunter in the direction of the moose while keeping quiet.\n\n\n== Lineage ==\nThe breed falls under the mitochondrial DNA sub-clade referred to as d1 that is only found in northern Scandinavia. It is the result of a female wolf-male dog hybridization that occurred post-domestication. Subclade d1 originated 480-3,000 years ago and is found in all Sami-related breeds: Finnish Lapphund, Swedish Lapphund, Lapponian Herder, Jamthund, Norwegian Elkhound and H\u00e4llefors Elkhound. The maternal wolf sequence that contributed to these breeds has not been matched across Eurasia and its branch on the phylogenetic tree is rooted in the same sequence as the 33,000 year-old Altai dog (not a direct ancestor).\nRefer: Ancient dog-wolf hybridization\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nAccording to The Kennel Club breed standard ideally the dog stands about 19.5\u201320.5 inches (50\u201352 cm) high and weighs up to 23 kilograms (51 lb). Its grey, white, and black coat is made up of two layers: an underlying dense smooth coat ranging from black at the muzzle, ears, and tip of its tail to silvery grey on its legs, tail, and underbody and an overlying black-tipped protective guard coat. An ideal Elkhound has a tightly curled tail, as the dog shown in the photograph on this page. The Elkhound is a medium-sized dog and extremely hardy.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nNorwegian Elkhounds are bred for hunting large game, such as wolf, bear and moose. Although the breed is strong and hardy, the dogs typically have an inseparable bond with their masters and are quite loyal. All Elkhounds have a sharp loud bark which makes them suitable as watchdogs.\nNorwegian Elkhounds are loyal to their \"pack\" and make excellent family dogs given proper attention. They are bold, playful, independent, alert, extremely intelligent, and, at times, a bit boisterous. They rank 54th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of above average working/obedience intelligence.\n\n\n== Health ==\nNorwegian Elkhounds sometimes carry a genetic predisposition to suffer from progressive retinal atrophy, or, like many medium and large breeds, hip dysplasia, renal problems, and cysts, particularly in later life; they are also prone to thyroid problems. Overall, however, they are a hardy breed with few health problems.\nElkhounds are prone to rapid weight gain and must not be overfed.\nThey have a lifespan of 12\u201316 years. There have been reports of elkhounds living to be 18 years old and older.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn Medieval times it was known as a dyrehund, meaning \"animal-dog\" in Norwegian, and was highly prized as a hunting dog but rarely seen or bred  outside of Norway.At the end of the 19th century the breed came to England, and in 1901 The Kennel Club officially recognized it.\n\n\n== Famous Norwegian Elkhounds ==\nPresident Herbert Hoover's \"Weejie\"\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\"Canute\" and others, in Virginia Woolf's novel, Orlando: A Biography\n\"Loth\" and other dyrehunds are featured in Sharon Kay Penman's historical novel \"When Christ and His Saints Slept\"\n\n\n=== Television ===\nIn The X-Files, Mulder blocks Eugene Victor Tooms when stalking a potential victim by asking him about his Norwegian Elkhound, Heinrich, in the episode \"Tooms.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nTahltan Bear Dog (extinct)\nNorwegian Lundehund\n\n\n== References ==\n\nLynch, Deborah and Jenny Madeoy. 2004 \"Man's best research guide: Breeds hold key to shared ailments.\" presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science by Deborah Lynch of the Canine Studies Institute in Aurora, Ohio and Jenny Madeoy of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Centre in Seattle.

Its name is a compound noun composed of the elements Lunde, meaning puffin (Norwegian lunde \"puffin\" or lundefugl \"puffin bird\"), and hund, meaning dog. The breed was originally developed for the hunting of puffins and their eggs.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Norwegian Lundehund is a small, rectangular Spitz type dog. The Lundehund has a great range of motion in its joints, allowing it to fit into and extricate itself from narrow passages.  Dogs of this breed are able to bend their head backwards along their own spine and turn their forelegs to the side at a 90-degree horizontal angle to their body, much like human arms. Their pricked, upright ears can be folded shut to form a near-tight seal by folding forward or backward. The Norwegian Lundehund is a polydactyl: instead of the normal four toes per foot, the Lundehund normally has six toes, all fully formed, jointed and muscled. Some specimens may on occasion have more or fewer than six toes per foot, but this is then outside the breed standard. The outercoat is dense and rough with a soft undercoat. The Lundehund is adapted to climb narrow cliff paths in V\u00e6r\u00f8y where it originally would have hunted puffins. Some general information can be found on the Norwegian Lundehund Association webpages \n\n\n== History ==\nThe breed has a long history. They are the most ancient of the Nordic dog breeds, scientific research indicates that the breed has been in existence since before the last Ice Age, surviving by eating fish and sea birds. While it is often claimed by breed related websites  that the Lundehund is actually a descendant of a primeval dog, Canis forus, rather than the domesticated dog breeds, Canis lupus familiaris, there is no recognized species Canis forus. The Lundehund was a valuable working animal, essential in hunting puffin birds along the Norwegian coast for food as well as the commercial export of puffin down from the Viking Age through the 16th and 17th centuries. Its flexibility and extra toes were ideal for hunting the birds in their inaccessible nesting locations on cliffs and in caves. Interest for the breed declined when new methods for hunting puffins were incorporated and a dog tax was created. Around 1900, they were only found in the isolated village of Mostad (spelled M\u00e5stad in Norwegian), Lofoten. The breed was nearly extinct around World War II when canine distemper struck V\u00e6r\u00f8y and the surrounding islands.  In 1963, the population was further decimated by another outbreak of distemper.  This time, only six dogs survived, one on V\u00e6r\u00f8y and five in southern Norway, Hamar. The latter five were from the same mother. This created a population bottleneck. Due to careful breeding with strict guidelines, there are now an estimated 1400 dogs in the world (2010), with around 600 of the population in Norway and ~350 in the United States.\nThe breed is being tested in Troms\u00f8 airport by the Norwegian Air Traffic and Airport Management as a solution to airplane bird strikes. The dog is used to search for bird eggs around the airport for disposal.\nHeight: 30\u201340 centimetres (12\u201316 in). Weight: 6\u20137 kilograms (13\u201315 lb); there is no weight range in the American Kennel Club breed standard. The Norwegian Lundehund Association of America, Inc. is recognized by the AKC as the Breed Parent Club for the USA.\n\n\n== Health ==\nA major issue with the Lundehund is gastroenteropathy which is a set of digestive disorders, and a loss of ability to absorb nutrients from food. In extreme cases the dog can starve due to its inability  to derive nutrients and protein from food, regardless of food intake. It is uncertain or not if all Lundehunds have the genetics to have this illness, since not every Lundehund is severely afflicted and some are symptom free. There is no cure, though the disease can be managed. There are indications that for the Lundehund to go on a low fat and higher protein diet has very positive effects on the health with respect to digestive problems.\nPrimarily the breed suffers from a very high inbreeding. This leads to low fertility, short lifespans, and high puppy mortality. The breed was threatened by extinction and is now undergoing a crossbreeding program spearheaded by the Norwegian Lundehund club with assistance from a group of geneticists. The program aims to employ a strategy of breeding the Norwegian Lundehund with various other Nordic dog breeds in order to reduce deleterious recessive genetic disorders.\n\n\n== AKC recognition ==\nThe Norwegian Lundehund was approved into the American Kennel Club's Non-Sporting Group on July 1, 2008, after a unanimous vote by the AKC Board of Directors on November 13, 2007. The Lundehund made its AKC conformation debut at the Roaring Fork Kennel Club show in Eagle, Colorado on July 12, 2008. It made its introductory premier at a major US event at the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, California, on December 13 and 14, 2008.\nOn February 12, 2010, the Board of Directors of the American Kennel Club voted to accept the Norwegian Lundehund into the AKC stud book on December 1, 2010. On January 1, 2011, it became a part of the Non-Sporting Group.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNorwegian Elkhound\nNorwegian Forest Cat\nNorwegian sheep landrace\nIcelandic goat\nNorwegian chicken landrace\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nISBN 0-7513-0856-0\n\"Lundehundboka\" ISBN 9788241908637\n\n\n== External links ==\nNorwegian Lundehund Association of America, Inc.\nThe Norwegian Lundehund Club of America\nThe International Web Page of the Norwegian Lundehund\nAmerican Norwegian Lundehund Club\nNRK website: Dogs prevent aircraft accidents\nhttp://lundehund.no/filer/brosjyre/engelsk.pdf"}, {"id": 347, "name": "Norwich Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog347", "description": "The Norwich Terrier is a breed of dog originating in the United Kingdom, and was bred to hunt small vermin or rodents. With a friendly personality, Norwich Terriers are today mostly a companion dog breed. One of the smallest terriers, these dogs are generally healthy, but are relatively rare, due in part to their low litter size and the common need for caesarian sections. Their drop-eared variety is the Norfolk Terrier.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThese terriers are one of the smallest working terriers 11\u201312 pounds (5.0\u20135.4 kg); 9\u201310 inches (23\u201325 cm) at the withers), with prick ears and a double coat, which come in red, tan, wheaten, black and tan, and grizzle.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThese small but hardy dogs can be courageous, intelligent and affectionate.  They can be assertive but it is not typical for them to be aggressive, quarrelsome or shy. They are energetic and thrive on an active life. They are also quite hungry all the time and will eat anything edible. They are eager to please but have definite minds of their own.  They are sensitive to scolding but 100% Terrier.  They should not usually be kept outside or in a kennel setting because they enjoy the companionship of their owners.  Norwich are not given to unnecessary barking, but they will warn of a stranger approaching.  Once they realize that there is no threat, they can become immediate friends.  Norwich are generally good with children, and if introduced to other household pets as a puppy they generally co-habit peacefully, though caution should be observed around rodent pets as they may be mistaken for prey.\n\n\n== Health ==\nUS and UK breed surveys put the life expectancy of the Norwich Terrier at 13\u201313.5 years. While the Norwich Terrier is considered a healthy breed, there are some health issues for which responsible breeders do preventive genetic health testing, thereby reducing the incidences.\n\nThe Norwich Terrier does have a predisposition for some health issues but studies to determine the exact mode of inheritance or the exact frequency in the breed are unknown or have not been conclusive.  At present there are no disorders identified as \"most important\".  Of secondary magnitude, cataracts are recognized as a disorder that has been reported sporadically and may be inherited.   Also of a secondary magnitude there are instances of epilepsy, narrow tracheas, luxating patellas, hip dysplasia, mitral valve disease, portosystemic shunts, atopy(allergic inhalant dermatitis) and incorrect bites (how the teeth meet when the jaws are closed).\nLike all dogs, Norwich Terriers can have autoimmune reactivity to rabies vaccinations. Rabies-Vaccine-Induced Ischemic Dermatopathy, or RVI-ID, is a non-fatal but potentially serious reaction to chemicals called adjuvants in the vaccine.  RVI-ID is often misdiagnosed, but if correctly diagnosed, is treatable.  Symptoms may include: symmetrical dark spots or lesions at the tips of the ears; swelling, hard lumps or dark spots in the vicinity of the injection site.\nHigher volume Norwich breeders are seeing more dogs with breathing concerns, and the Norwich and Norfolk Terrier Club (USA) has formed a new \"Health and Genetics Sub-Committee for Research on Upper Airway Syndrome in Norwich Terriers\".  Upper Airway Syndrome (UAS) covers all abnormalities that can occur in the upper airway, including:  elongated soft palates; too short soft palates; narrow/misshapen tracheas; collapsing tracheas; stenotic nares (nasal passages that are too small); swollen tonsils; everted laryngeal saccules.  These upper airway disorders can occur singly or in combination with one or two others.  All compromise the airway and the dog's ability to breathe normally; the dog's breathing often sounds raspy or moist.  It may be that shorter muzzles may have increased incidence of such issues.\nNorwich Terriers generally have small litters of 1 to 3 puppies. Generally, if a female is healthy, its optimal breeding period is between the ages of 2 (after all genetic health testing is complete - heart, eyes, hips and patellas) and six years.  At seven years of age dogs are considered geriatric.  The small supply and the high price of a purebred Norwich Terrier - often around US$2,500 in 2008 - has attracted fraud, as unsuspecting buyers pay full price for Cairn Terriers with docked tails, or mixed-breed puppies.\nIn Canada and the United States, the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals maintains an open registry of dogs that have completed their genetic health testing program.\n\n\n== Care ==\n\n\n=== Exercise requirements ===\n\nNorwich Terriers are hardy, active dogs, bred for a working life of pursuing vermin and accompanying their farmer owners on horseback.  A good daily walk is therefore the minimum needed to meet the exercise requirements of a healthy Norwich Terrier.  Norwich Terriers compete in Earthdog competitions, and are increasingly common in Agility and Flyball competitions. The dogs were bred as working terriers, and thrive best with at least one hour of real activity daily, such as a good walk, run, or working session.\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\nThe Norwich Terrier has two coats - a harsh, wiry topcoat and a soft warm undercoat. Ideally, the coat is combed  with a steel comb daily to once a week to remove the loose, dead hairs and prevent matting. Proper maintenance of the Norwich coat, like other hard wiry coats, requires \"stripping,\" or pulling the oldest hairs from the coat (using fingers and/or a \"stripping knife,\" a special grooming comb).  Stripping results both in the coat retaining its proper appearance, and in the health of the dog's skin and coat. Ideally, owners hand-strip the coat on a regular basis to achieve what is called a \"rolling\" coat, where hairs of all lengths are growing in.  Maintaining a rolling coat is easier on the dog's skin and requires shorter grooming sessions.  At minimum, the coat should be stripped once in the autumn and once in the spring. Clipping or cutting negatively affects the appearance of the coat's natural colours and texture.\n\n\n=== Tail docking ===\n\nOnly the American Kennel Club calls for a medium docked (long enough for a man's hand to grasp) tail, though a natural tail is not a disqualification.   In Australia and Canada tail docking is optional, but in New South Wales, it is illegal. In the United Kingdom, tail docking is only permitted for working dogs and is banned for dogs bred as pets or showing. Other countries that have banned tail docking include: Norway in 1987, and Sweden in 1988. In the last four years Cyprus, Greece, Luxembourg and Switzerland have also decided to introduce a ban on tail docking.Historically, tails were docked in the UK to avoid taxation of sporting dogs. Today, proponents of tail docking argue working Norwich Terriers should have a docked tail because there is less risk of damaging the tail or spine if it is used to extract the dog from a hole.  Some proponents suggest the docked tail makes for a prettier breed silhouette.  Opponents of tail docking note that docking severely damages the important canine tail-signalling system, so vital to dogs' social communication.  Where form follows function, the tail assists the dog with balance for movement over rough terrain and turning at speed.  Arguments for and against tail docking are covered in this Michigan State University (Detroit College of Law) paper, including \"History\":\n\n\n== Breeding ==\n\nNorwich Terriers are difficult to breed. Many have Caesarean sections. The North American average litter size for 2007 is two puppies with the total number of puppies for the year, in the USA, at approximately 750.\nThere are breeding lines with higher average litter sizes as can be easily traced in pedigrees of kennel clubs who include such information, i.e. The Dutch Kennel Club. Similar information can be obtained at internet site of Finnish Kennel Club. Recently in the United States, there has been significant pedigree fraud.  Sometimes these fake Norwich Terriers are sold over the internet.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe breed has existed since at least the late 19th century as a working terrier of East Anglia, England. The dogs were useful as ratters in the stable yard, bolters of fox for the hunt, and family companions. It was the mascot of Cambridge students. Small red terriers, descendants of Irish Terriers, had existed in the area since at least the 1860s, and these might be the ancestors of the Norwich, or it might have come from the Trumpington Terrier, a breed that no longer exists. In its earliest history, it was also known as the Jones Terrier and the Cantab Terrier.Since its earliest identification as a breed, puppies have had either drop or prick ears, and both were allowed when the Norwich was first recognized in the show ring in 1932 by The Kennel Club (England). Drop ears were often cropped until it became illegal to do so. This intensified a long-standing controversy over whether drop-eared dogs should be allowed in the show ring and whether the primary difference was simply the ears or whether other, deeper, personality and structural differences marked the drop-eared variety. Starting in the 1930s, breeders increased their efforts to distinguish the breeds.  While Norfolk and Norwich Terriers were inter-bred for a number of years today they are positively two distinctive breeds.  In fact some historical texts indicate that they were distinctive breeds before they were inter-bred.\nBoth ear types continued to be allowed in the ring until The Kennel Club recognized the drop-eared variety as a separate breed, the Norfolk Terrier, in 1964, and the American Kennel Club, United Kennel Club, and Canadian Kennel Club did the same in 1979. Until that time, the breeds were designated by the AKC as Norwich Terriers, P.E. (prick ears) and Norwich Terriers, D.E. (drop ears).\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBibliography\n\nBunting, Marjorie (1997). The Norwich Terrier. Bromma: M\u00e4lar\u00f6b\u00f6rsen.

It is often referred to as a \"toller\". It is the smallest of the retrievers, and is often mistaken for a small Golden Retriever. Tollers are known to be intelligent, easy to please, alert, and high-energy dogs. The name \"toller\" is derived from their ability to lure waterfowl within gunshot range. The breed originated in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia, Canada. The American Kennel Club ranks the toller as the 87th most popular dog breed.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe breed was developed in the community of Little River Harbour in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia, around the beginning of the 19th century. The toller was originally referred to as the Little River Duck Dog before being officially recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club in 1945 as a pure bred dog. The toller is a mixture of retrievers, spaniels, setters, and possibly a farm collie mix breed, although this has yet to be confirmed. The breed was perfected in the second half of the 19th century.The breed gained national recognition in 1980, and was declared the provincial dog of Nova Scotia in 1995, when two Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers were awarded Best in Show at championship events that included many breeds.\n\n\n== Use in hunting ==\nTollers are named for their ability to entice or lure waterfowl within gunshot range, called \"tolling\". The hunter stays hidden in a blind and sends the dog out to romp and play near the water, usually by tossing a ball or stick to be retrieved. The dog's appearance is similar to that of a fox. Its unusual activity and white markings pique the curiosity of ducks and geese which swim over to investigate.\n\nWhen the birds are close, the hunter calls the dog back to the blind then rises putting the birds to flight allowing the hunter a shot. The Toller then retrieves any downed birds. They are particularly suited for retrieving in cold water climates because of their water-repellent double coat.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nTollers are often mistaken for small Golden Retrievers, but the Toller is more active, both physically and mentally. According to the breed standards, the Toller is athletic, muscular, compact, medium to heavy boned, balanced and powerful. The chest is deep. Conformation judges require Tollers to be capable of tolling and physical faults that inhibit working ability are heavily penalized. They should be of moderate build \u2014 a lack of substance or a heavy build are penalized by judges because both detract from the breed standard and athleticism. The legs are sturdy and solid and they have webbed feet.Tollers can be any shade of red ranging from a golden red through dark coppery red with lighter featherings on the underside of the tail, pantaloons, and body. The lighter shades of golden red are deeply pigmented and rich in colour. The Toller should not be buff, brown, or beige, though some buff and sable Tollers do appear in breeding lines.It is common for a Toller to have at least one of the following white markings: tip of tail, feet (not extending above the pasterns) and chest. Lack of white is not a fault; Tollers can be born without white markings. Dogs with white on the shoulders, around ears, back of neck, across back or flanks, or with silvery, grey or black areas in coat are disqualified from conformation shows.The Toller was bred to retrieve from icy waters and must have a water-repellent double coat of medium length and softness and a soft dense undercoat. The coat may have a slight wave on the back but is otherwise straight. Some winter coats may form a long loose curl at the throat. Featherings are soft and moderate in length, the tail is well feathered and held jauntily when the dog is excited or moving.. The hair on the muzzle is short and fine. Seasonal shedding is to be expected.Those who breed Tollers for conformation shows consider the head (clean cut, slightly wedge-shaped) to be an important feature and believe it should resemble that of a fox and must never be blocky like that of a Golden Retriever. The ears are triangular and set high and well back from the skull. The pigment on a toller's nose, lips and eye rims should match, and should be either black (which normally fades with age) or liver, blending into the coat. Lips fit fairly tightly around the mouth. The correct bite is a scissor bite, full dentition is required. Jaws are strong enough to carry a large bird, but Tollers must have a soft mouth too. Eyes are set well apart, almond shaped, and medium-sized and amber to dark brown in colour. Expression is friendly, alert, and intelligent.\n\n\n=== Size and proportions ===\nTollers are the smallest of all the retriever breeds. They range in height from 17\u201321 in (43\u201353 cm) at the withers, and weigh 30\u201350 lb (14\u201323 kg), with females being slightly shorter and lighter. Tollers are a medium-sized breed.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nNova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers are known to be very intelligent, curious, alert, outgoing, and high-energy dogs. They are affectionate, eager to please, busy, and get along well with children. They are good family dogs, however during the decision process potential owners should be wary of the physical and mental commitment that is required in order to keep a Toller busy. Physical stimulation should be provided for these dogs each day since they may become destructive when they are not exercised enough or are left alone for long periods of time.\n\nDuck Tollers are working animals and are happiest when they have a job to do. Tollers are excellent hunting companions. They excel at many types of sporting competitions such as agility, dock diving, and obedience. Their keen sense of smell, intelligence, drive for work, and small size make them perfect search and rescue dogs. The breed standard states that the dog should have a strong retrieving drive, intense birdiness, endurance, and a love for water.Tollers do not have an aggressive bark. Some have a unique sounding bark known as the \"Toller scream\", a high-pitched howl-like sound which is often referred to as their \"singing\". They do not use this in violent situations, rather; the \"toller scream\" is expressed when they are excited.\n\n\n=== Socialization ===\nTollers have the capacity to be very social dogs as long as they are sufficiently socialized early on in life. While Tollers are energetic and outgoing around their owners and family, their cautious nature makes them reserved around strangers. Exposure to new people, locations, smells, and sights are crucial to the healthy development of the Toller breed. They tend to get along well with other dogs, however, they have a strong prey drive and may chase after cats or other small animals. Their prey drive can be avoided if cats, for example, are introduced early on in a Toller's life. Failure to properly socialize Tollers at a young age may result in aggressive, destructive, or timid behaviour in maturity.\n\n\n== Health ==\nTollers are generally hardy. However, like almost all dog breeds, certain genetic disorders are known to occur in the breed. This is sometimes blamed on a relatively small gene pool. The Finnish breed club states the largest health problems in the breed tend to be immunity related. They can be affected by eye problems and hip dysplasia and are predisposed to immune-mediated rheumatic disease and steroid-responsive meningitis\u2013arthritis.Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) affects about 7% of Tollers with an estimated 40% being carriers. The type of PRA associated with the breed is known as progressive rod-cone degeneration. The disease causes cells in the retina to degenerate and die. This causes night blindness at first and eventually complete blindness. Collie eye anomaly is estimated to have a carrier rate of 5% and an affected rate of 0.5%. It generally only causes mildly impaired vision, although in more severe cases it can lead to retinal hemorrhaging and detachments resulting in blindness.Thyroid problems have been identified by American breeders as a priority issue, together with epilepsy and hip dysplasia. As many as 1 in 6 Tollers may have autoimmune thyroiditis. Symptoms of thyroid problems includes weight gain, skin and hair problems including hair loss, weakness, cold intolerance or infertility.Addison's disease affected 1% of Tollers in a health survey, an incidence rate 10 times more than the general dog population. Carrier rate is estimated at 18%. This disease is also considered an important issue in the breed. Signs include lethargy, decreased appetite, vomiting, weakness, diarrhea, increased drinking and urination, and shivering.Aseptic meningitis (sometimes called steroid-responsive meningitis) has been diagnosed in increasing numbers in the Norwegian Toller population in recent years. Symptoms include intensive neck pain, fever, and lethargy. Prevalence is estimated at 2.5% in the Norwegian population.Health tests are available for both eye diseases and autoimmune thyroiditis. A test for Addison's disease is available but it is only for one form of the disease and there are other forms which also affect the breed. A test is also available for one form of cleft palate that is exclusive to Tollers. Early testing shows a carrier rate of about 15%.A survey conducted in 2002 by the Canadian Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever breed club to discover which diseases and conditions occur in the Toller population, involving owners of 1180 dogs worldwide, showed 73% reported in excellent health and a total of 7.5% reporting poor or bad health. 141 dogs (12%) were reported as deceased with the average age at death being 6.4 years. The most common cause of death was cancer, reported in 25% of deaths, with old age being the next most common at 9%.A worldwide study of the Tollers' registration history in 17 countries shows that about 90% of the genetic diversity present in the founding population has been lost. Tollers born between 1999\u20132008 have an effective founder size of 9.8, realized effective population size of 18 and an average inbreeding coefficient of 0.26. Breeders are working to prevent losing heterozygosity and to maintain sufficient genetic variations. High kinship value means the breed is not able to maintain a steady level of inbreeding in the long term.\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\nThe Toller is known to excel in various sporting and obedience activities, and health and safety related jobs. The breeds' high energy and intelligence makes them perfect candidates for difficult jobs that require tremendous dedication and skill. Tollers enjoy working and being outside, therefore, it is no surprise that they excel at various sport and job related activities.The breed is categorized as a \"sporting\" dog under the CKC and AKA organizations making tollers ideal dogs for various physical activities. Other kennel clubs such as the AKNC and UKC categorize tollers as a \"gundog\" which depicts their drive, mental intelligence, and intuitive hunting sense. Kennel clubs throughout the world recognize Tollers as an athletic, intelligent, and a driven breed that has the innate ability to excel in any of the following activities: dog agility, dock jumping, disc catching, flyball, lure coursing, obedience, search and rescue, therapy dog, and hunting.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 349, "name": "Old Croatian Sighthound", "country": "Croatia", "type": "", "picture": "dog349", "description": "The Old Croatian Sighthound, regionally known as the hrti, is a breed of dog from Croatia. Originally developed as a sighthound, the greyhound-like breed was almost exterminated during Croatia's time as part of Yugoslavia; however, its continued existence was confirmed in December 2008.This recent (Bauer & Lemo, December 2008) report containing a record of a preserved nucleus of a regional Old World sighthound, the hrt, or Old Croatian sighthound, is a notable cynological and veterinary contribution to sighthound history. It is one more confirmation of the mechanism behind the extinction of sighthound varieties, where the loss of \"aristocratic\", landed hunting rights (pursued mainly by horse, and hound) gave place to \"universal\", licensed hunting rights (pursued mainly on foot, by gun) which tended to literally outlaw sighthounds. Sighthounds, which by definition require large open tracts of land, became an object of suspected poaching, and were often actively persecuted. Consequently the regional and national varieties, which for ages had been prolific across Europe, were eradicated or allowed to die out. The Chort, Magyar Agar and Chart, for example escaped this fate, the Frisian sighthound did not. Where national breed and Kennel Clubs actively encouraged sighthound studbooks, and where a strong coursing culture was present sighthounds such as the Galgo survived. In some cases, as with the latter, and as Bauer and Lemo report in connection with the hrt, regional sighthound identity could be compromised by crosses to Greyhounds or other breeds.\n\n\n== Physiology ==\nThe type is of greyhound-conformation with rose-ears, short-coated, predominantly white body color, with black, or dark brown to yellowish spotting. Males reaching 60\u201370 cm in height, females 5\u201310 cm shorter.\nHistorically the breed has been confirmed as a sighthound through its use in coursing, and preserved to the present day with occasional cross-breeding with English Greyhounds, other sighthounds and other breeds.\n\n\n== Notes and references =="}, {"id": 350, "name": "Old Danish Pointer", "country": "Denmark", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog350", "description": "The Old Danish Pointer is a medium-sized  breed of dog, white with brown markings, originally used as a pointing dog in Denmark.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nOld Danish Pointers (Danish: gammel dansk h\u00f8nsehund, translated \"Old Danish Fowl-Dog\") are strongly built. One of the most charming features of the breed is the great difference between male and female.

During the hunt, the dog progresses rather slowly, always maintaining contact with the hunter and accomplishing its task as a pointing dog without creating unnecessary disturbance of the ground. The breed is suited for small as well as large hunting grounds.\nThe name has nothing to do with temperament, but refers to its ability to point out  birds of the order Galliformes and specifically birds belonging to the family Phasianidae. Commonly referred to in Danish as Hen birds/Chicken birds. The often used English name, \"Old Danish Chicken Dog\" is therefore incorrect or at best badly translated.\nThis is a friendly family dog, as long as it gets its exercise. It is fast and active outdoors and quiet indoors, but is not suitable for apartments or small yards.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe origin of the breed can be traced back to about the year 1710 when a man named Morten Bak, living in Glenstrup near the towns of Randers and Hobro, crossed gypsy dogs through 8 generations  with local farmdogs and in this way established a pure breed of piebald white and brown dogs called Bakhounds or Old Danish Pointers.  The local farmers called their farmdogs  Bloodhounds, but it seems more likely that these hounds were offspring from the Squire\u2019s scent hounds, which in turn were descended primarily from  St. Hubert Hounds.  Likewise it is probable that the gypsy dogs generally descended from Spanish Pointing Dogs and other breeds of scent hounds, so in many ways St.Hubert Hounds have contributed to the Old Danish Pointer.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDKK breed standards"}, {"id": 351, "name": "Old English Bulldog", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog351", "description": "The Old English Bulldog is an extinct breed of dog.\n\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n\nThe Old English Bulldog was compact, broad and muscular, as reflected in the well-known depiction Crib and Rosa. Through John Scott's engraving, this painting became the best-known and most reproduced painting of dogs from that period. The average height was approximately 15 inches (380 mm), and they weighed about 45 pounds (20 kg). A particular characteristic of the breed was the lower jaw that projected considerably in front of the upper jaw, which made possible a strong, vise-like grip.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe English blood sport of bull-baiting allowed for a specialized breed in the form of the Old English Bulldog. The main locations in London for these exhibitions were the Westminster Pit, Beargarden and Old Conduit Fields. One of the breeders who spanned the transition period between the Old English Bulldog and the modern Bulldog was famous dog dealer Bill George.\n\n\n=== Breeding ===\nHistorians are fairly confident that the Old English Bulldog is derived from ancient war dogs, such as the old Mastiff or Alaunt.  Others believe that the true origin of the breed is not entirely clear.  Depictions in old prints show that the variety was without doubt a small Mastiff with a comparatively long head.  The word 'Mastiff' was eventually dropped when describing these smaller Mastiffs, as the Mastiff proper was found too slow for bull-baiting.  Eventually, the Greyhound was crossed into the breed, increasing the Mastiff's speed without losing the breed's ferocity.  This step reduced the Old English Bulldog's size and weight, with the Greyhound's features seen in specimens of that time.\n\n\n=== Description ===\nTwo other recognized members of the breed can be seen in the 1817 painting Crib and Rosa, with Rosa exemplifying the form and size of the ideal type of Old English Bulldog, albeit deficient in wrinkles about the head and neck and in substance of bone in the limbs. They are faster than regular bulldogs and have an average speed of 7 miles per hour (11 km/h).Many authors bring us descriptions about the extinct bulldog, but a description stands out as one of the most extensive by William Hamilton Maxwell:\n\n\u201cBULL-DOG (Canis Molossus), s. A dog of particular form, remarkable for his courage.The bull-dog is low in stature, deep-chested, and strongly made about the shoulders and thighs, the muscles of both of which are extremely developed. His head is broad, his nose short, and the under jaw projects beyond the upper, which gives him a fierce and disagreeable aspect. His eyes are distant and prominent, and have a peculiar suspicious-like leer, which, with the distension of his nostrils, gives him also a contemptuous look; and from his teeth being always seen, he has the constant appearance of grinning, while he is perfectly placid. He is the most ferocious and unrelenting of the canine tribe, and may be considered courageous beyond every other creature in the world, for he will attack any animal, whatever be his magnitude.\nThe internal changes which determine the external characters of this dog, consist in a great development of the frontal sinuses, a development which elevates the bones of the forehead above the nose, and draws the cerebral cavity in the same direction.\nBut the most important quality, and that, perhaps, which causes all the others, although we cannot perceive the connexion, is the diminution of the brain. The cerebral capacity of the bull-dog is sensibly smaller than in any other race; and it is doubtless to the decrease of the encephalon that we must attribute its inferiority to all others in every thing relating to intelligence. The bull-dog is scarcely capable of any education, and is fitted for nothing but combat and ferocity.\nThis animal takes his name from his having been employed, in former times, in assaulting the bull, and he is used for the same purpose at the present day, in those districts where this brutal amusement is still practised.\nNothing can exceed the fury with which the bull-dog falls upon all other animals, and the invincible obstinacy with which he maintains his hold. In attacking the bull, he always assails him in front, and generally fastens upon his lip, tongue, or eye, where he holds and hangs on, in spite of the most desperate efforts of the other to free himself from his antagonist, which affords ample proof of the amazing strength and power of this animal.\nWhenever a bull-dog attacks any of the extremities of the body, it is invariably considered a mark of his degeneracy from the original purity of blood. Puppies will assail a bull, and thereby give a decided proof of their breed, when only six months old; and, if permitted, will rather suffer themselves to be destroyed than relinquish the contest.\nAlthough this trial is sometimes made with the whelps of a particular litter, to demonstrate the purity of their descent, and to prove that there has been no improper cross by which the future fame of their posterity may be affected, yet they are seldom entered in a regular ring until from fifteen to eighteen months old. But their ligaments cannot be considered as at their full strength until they are at least two years old. Indeed, amateurs say, that they are not at their prime until they have attained four or five years of age.\n\nThe bull-dog is admitted by naturalists to be one of the original and peculiar races of Britain, and may be ranked, in point of originality, with the shepherd\u2019s dog and Irish greyhound. In various districts of England this breed is still preserved in its native purity, by that class of people who delight in bullbaiting and fighting of dogs; both of which amusements, alike inhuman, are now happily on the decline. \u2014 Brown.\u201d\n\n\n=== Decline ===\n\nIn England, the passage of the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 caused a decline of bull-baiting and dog fighting, leading to a lack of interest in perpetuating the Old English Bulldog. Three dogs from the Duke of Hamilton's strain of Old English Bulldog, Wasp, Child, and Billy, were depicted in a painting and recognized as some of the last known members of the breed before they became extinct.\nDespite the laws making dog fighting illegal, the activity continued for many years.  Breeders determined a cross between the Old English Bulldog and Old English Terrier created a superior fighting dog with increased quickness and dexterity.  This new breed of dog, called the Bull and Terrier, was a precursor to the Bull Terrier and American Pit Bull Terrier and accelerated the extinction of the Old English Bulldog.\n\n\n== Reincarnations ==\nSeveral breeders are attempting to recreate this extinct breed, using known descendants of the Old English Bulldog lineage, with some success. As the breed went extinct long before DNA was recognized and little genetic material has survived, it is unclear how much the modern reincarnations of the breed resemble the original Old English Bulldog, and most of the recreations have purposely introduced differences in the breed compared to the original, most prominently reducing the breed's violent nature.\nOne contemporary recreation of the breed started in the 1970s, using a breeding program developed for cattle at The Ohio State University. The lineage has since split into two, known as the Olde English Bulldogge and the Leavitt Bulldog, the Leavitt Bulldog being a lighter, more athletic dog. These modern day versions, though possessing similar physical abilities, do not have the violent temperament of the Old English Bulldog. The line-breeding was done with a foundation of half Bulldog, and the other half Bullmastiff and American Bulldog and American Pit Bull Terrier.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nThere are several other recreations, including the Able Bulldog, Continental bulldog, Dorset Old Tyme Bulldogge, Olde English Bulldogge, Renascence Bulldogge, Victorian Bulldog and Wilkinson Bulldog.\n\n\n== Bulldog ==\n\nOften confused with the Old English Bulldog, the Bulldog is noted for its sweet disposition; however, it has maintained little of the speed and agility that were the definitive characteristics of the Old English Bulldog.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of dog fighting breeds\nBulldog breeds\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBrearley J.M.

Obsolete names for the breed include Shepherd's Dog and bob-tailed sheep-dog. The nickname Bob-tail (or Bobtail) originates from how dogs of the breed traditionally had their tails docked. Old English Sheepdogs can grow very long coats with fur covering the face and eyes and do not shed unless brushed.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Old English Sheepdog is a large dog, immediately recognizable by its long, thick, shaggy grey and white coat, with fur covering their face and eyes. The ears lie flat to the head. Historically, the breed's tail was commonly docked (resulting in a panda bear-like rear end), but tailed Old English sheepdogs are now common, as many countries have outlawed cosmetic docking.  When the dog has a tail, it has long fur (feathering), is low set, and normally hangs down. The Old English Sheepdog stands lower at the shoulder than at the loin, and walks with a \"bear-like roll from the rear\".Height at the withers is at least 61 cm (24 in), with females slightly smaller than males. The body is short and compact, and ideal weights are not specified in the breed standards, but may be as much as 46 kg (101 lb) for large males.Colour of the double coat may be any shade of grey, grizzle, black, blue, or blue merle, with optional white markings. The undercoat is water resistant. Puppies are born with a black and white coat, and it is only after the puppy coat has been shed that the more common grey or silver shaggy hair appears. Old English Sheepdogs only shed when they are brushed.\n\n\n== Docking ==\nUndocked Old English Sheepdogs are becoming a more common sight as many countries have now banned docking (such as Canada). The Kennel Club (UK) and The Australian National Kennel Council breed standards do not express a preference for (legally) docked or un-docked animals, and either can be shown. The American Kennel Club breed standard states that the tail should be \"docked close to the body, when not naturally bob tailed\", even though the practice of cosmetic docking is currently opposed by the American Veterinary Medical Association.  It is believed that the practice of tail docking came about in the 18th century as a result of taxation laws that required working dogs to be docked as evidence of their working status, but nowadays, in places where the practice is still legal, tail docking is mainly performed for purely cosmetic reasons.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Old English Sheepdog comes from the very old pastoral type dogs of England, but no records were kept of the dogs, and everything about the earliest types is guesswork. A small drop-eared dog seen in a 1771 painting by Gainsborough is believed by some to represent the early type of the Old English Sheepdog. In the early 19th century a bobtailed drovers dog, called the Smithfield or Cotswold Cor, was noticed in the southwestern counties of England and may have been an ancestor. Most fanciers agree that the Bearded Collie was among the original stock used in developing today's breed.  Some speculate that the Russian Owtchar was among the breed's ancestors.The Old English Sheepdog was at first called the \"Shepherd's Dog\" and was exhibited for the first time at a show in Birmingham, England, in 1873. There were only three entries, and the judge felt the quality of the dogs was so poor that he offered only a second placing. From that beginning, the breed became a popular show dog, and, although the shape of the dog itself has changed very little over the years, elaborate grooming including backcombing and powdering the fur was recorded as early as 1907. The breed was exported to the United States in the 1880s, and by the turn of the 20th century, five of the ten wealthiest American families bred and showed the Old English Sheepdog. The breed continues to be a popular show dog today.\n\n\n== Health ==\nUS and UK surveys put the average lifespan of the  Old English Sheepdog at 10\u201311 years.  The Old English Sheepdog Club of America sponsors investigations into diseases encountered in the breed in order to assist breeders in selecting healthy dogs for breeding, and breeders of Old English Sheepdogs who are members of the Old English Sheepdog Club of America must support its Code of Ethics in breeding and selling sheepdogs. Some diseases being investigated include hip dysplasia, cataracts, glaucoma, entropion, thyroid problems, deafness, diabetes, HD, PRA, allergies and skin problems. There is no data on how many dogs are affected, or what percent of the breed is affected by any of these ailments. Heatstroke is also a serious concern in full coated dogs.  Cancer is a major cause of death amongst Old English Sheepdogs.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe breed standards describe the ideal Old English Sheepdog as never being nervous or aggressive. The New Zealand Kennel Club adds that \"they are sometimes couch potatoes\" and \"may even try to herd children by gently bumping them.\" This breed's temperament can be described as intelligent, social and adaptable. The American Kennel Club adds that the breed has \"a clownish energy\" and \"may try to herd people or other objects.\"With wide open spaces being the ideal setting for an Old English Sheepdog, the breed is a natural fit in a rural setting, such as working on a farm; although, with proper exercise and training, they are perfectly comfortable with a suburban or urban lifestyle. Old English Sheepdogs should not be deprived of the company and the warmth of people.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe Old English Sheepdog can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, Rally obedience, Schutzhund, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Old English Sheepdogs that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== Famous Old English Sheepdogs ==\nSee generally, List of fictional dogs\n\nAlfie in Serpico\nAnnabell in Foofur\nAmbrosius in Labyrinth (film)\nBarney in Barney (TV series)\nBarkley in  Sesame Street\nBarry in The Tale of Edward\nBebe in Captain Kangaroo\n\"Big Dog\" in 2 Stupid Dogs\nBoot in The Perishers\nBroo in The Raccoons\nChiffon in The Shaggy Dog (1959)\nColonel in One Hundred and One Dalmatians\nCu in Song of the Sea\nJerry in 101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure\nDigby in Digby, the Biggest Dog in the World\nDrooler in Krypto the Superdog \nEdison in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\nElwood in The Shaggy D.A.\nLad in \"Please don't eat the daisies\"\nLat in The Brady Bunch\nFarley in For Better or For Worse\nHot Dog in Archie Comics\nMartha, Paul McCartney's Old English Sheepdog was said to be the namesake of Martha My Dear.\nMax in The Little Mermaid and The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea\nMr. Mugs\nMooch in Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure\nMuffin Mclay in Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy, the first book in a series of children's picture books featuring Hairy Maclary\nNana in Hook (film)\nNate in Open Season 3\nNiblet, Giblet, and Rebound on Pound Puppies\nPresley on Andrew in New York\nSam in Cats & Dogs and Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore\nSamson in Samson en Gert (TV series)\nShag in Road Rovers\nSchaeffer in The Raccoons\nTiger in The Patty Duke Show\nWordsworth in Jamie and the Magic Torch\n\n\n== Coat care ==\n\nThe Old English Sheepdog's long coat requires a thorough brushing at least once weekly, which may take one to three hours. Without regular care, the coat can become \"a trap for dust, debris, fecal matter, urine and moisture.\" Matting may become painful to the animal, such as in between the toes, and can restrict movement in severe cases. Prospective owners may be deterred by the level of care required if long hair is desired.\nThe preferred method of grooming involves starting from the base of the hairs to keep the thick undercoat hair mat- and tangle-free. The brushing should be started at a very young age to get the dog used to it. A hairband may be used to keep a dog's fur out of its eyes. Many people trim their dogs' coats to a more manageable length. A professional quality electric shear reduces time spent trimming. However, dogs that are being shown in conformation must retain their natural coat.Some people shave their Sheepdog's hair and spin it into yarn.\n\n\n== Dulux Dog ==\nThe Old English Sheepdog is the brand mascot for Dulux paint. The dog was first introduced in Australian advertising campaigns in the 1960s. Since then they have been a constant and highly popular feature of Dulux television and print advertisements in Australia, South Africa and the UK, and people in those markets refer colloquially to the breed as a \"Dulux dog\".\nOver the years, different dogs have appeared in the advertisements, all very similar in appearance, as most of them have been selected from a closely related line of pedigree dogs. The first Dulux dog was Shepton Dash, who held the role for eight years. His successor, Fernville Lord Digby, was the most famous Dulux dog and also made his owner, Cynthia Harrison, famous. When filming commercials, Digby was treated like a star and was driven to the studio by a chauffeur. Barbara Woodhouse was employed to train Digby and his three stunt doubles, who were used whenever specific tricks or actions needed to be filmed.\nApart from Dash, all the Dulux dogs have been breed champions. Five of them have won 'Best of Show' prizes. The most recent Dulux Dog, Don, is Crufts Qualified.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBobtail (disambiguation)\nDog terminology\nEnglish Shepherd\nPastoral\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOld English Sheepdog at Curlie"}, {"id": 353, "name": "Old English Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "", "picture": "dog353", "description": "The Old English Terrier is a dog breed of the terrier type.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe Old English is a working and sporting terrier that is, in general, an exceptional athlete with a high, intense, and vigorous prey drive that is followed, if need be, by an awesome display of gameness.\nThe breed as a whole is very physically and mentally active. They require a lot of exercise and mental challenges. They are extremely people friendly, and make wonderful companion pets.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBy the 18th century the Old English Terrier also known as the Black Terrier had been developed into two types, the rough-coated Black Terrier and the smooth-coated Black Terrier. The rough-coated Black Terrier had been established in England during the 17th and 18th century. The smooth-coated Black Terrier was likely the result of crosses made between the rough-coated Black Terriers, smooth-coated Terriers and other smooth-coated English breeds. By the mid- to late 18th century the smooth-coated Black Terrier type had been established.The Old English Terrier was developed and selected based on the quarry or work which it was specifically needed for, and this led to variations in body, coat and size.\nHenry Compton in his book 'The Twentieth Century Dog (1904)' wrote (concerning the history of the terrier):\n\nThere were in different parts of the island yellow terriers, and red terriers, and black terriers, and black and tan terriers, and brindle terriers, and greyish terriers; there were large terriers, weighing from 30 pounds to 40 lbs., and one mentioned as weighing 50 lbs., and there were small terriers for whom an \"under 9 lbs.\" class was provided; there were terriers with smooth coats, and wire coats, and curly coats; there were, in short, terrier types enough to create a collection.\n\nBy the early 19th century the Old English Terrier could be found throughout the world. In Henry George Ward's book Mexico, Ward wrote about his harsh journey to Mexico and the tenacity, grit, and ability of the Black Terrier that accompanied him on his trip in 1827. The Oriental Sporting Magazine, in April, 1828, printed a poem about a Black Terrier that had been killed by a tiger in Southern Konkan.\n\n\n== The Name \"Old English Terrier\" ==\nThe term \"Old English Terrier\" has also been applied, in the past and present, to the Patterdale Terrier, Black and Tan Terrier and Manchester Terrier to some degree or another. However, there is only one Old English Terrier registered with any registry.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 354, "name": "Old German Shepherd Dog", "country": "Germany", "type": "", "picture": "dog354", "description": "Old German Shepherd Dog (German: Altdeutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund) is a controversial name for the long-haired variation of the German Shepherd Dog (German: Langstockhaariger Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund), which is not a separate breed recognized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale. Nonetheless, there are efforts to establish this variety as a separate breed.\n\n\n== History ==\nUnder the Society for the German Shepherd Dog the long-haired variation of the German Shepherd was not accepted for a long time. This changed in 2009. In 2010, the long-haired variation was again accepted. Before that, Breeders of the long-haired variation of the German Shepherd had founded their own Kennel Clubs and had called the long-haired hair variation the \"Old German Shepherd\". \nSome old German landraces of cattle dogs are also called Altdeutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund (Old German Shepherd Dog). To avoid confusion, all of these races are now summarized under the generic term Altdeutsche H\u00fctehunde (Old German herding dogs).\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nMost of them appear similar to the long-haired variation of the modern German Shepherd, although with slightly different colouring patterns. The coat may be any length and can be shaggy, smooth or wiry. The colours may be black, brown, grey or tan. They are generally the same height as a typical German Shepherd: 55 and 65 centimetres (22 and 26 in) at the withers.  They weigh between 22 and 40 kilograms (49 and 88 lb) but can be larger.\nOld German Shepherds are bred with a straighter back than regular German Shepherds. \n\n\n== See also ==\nOld German herding dogs\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOld German Shepherds"}, {"id": 355, "name": "Old Time Farm Shepherd", "country": "United States", "type": "", "picture": "dog355", "description": "The Old Time Farm Shepherd is a rare breed of working dog known for its versatility and intelligence. Old Time Farm Shepherds are the descendants of the old working Scotch Collies that were common on farms in America in the early twentieth century; as a recognized breed, they were started by J. Richard McDuffie in 1994.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Old Time Farm Shepherds are medium-sized, collie-type dogs with moderate coats and large, expressive eyes. They come in a range of colors including sable, tri-color, merle, and black and tan. Sable and white is the commonest color. Most Old Time Farm Shepherds are in the 40 - 50 pound range. Tails may be full or natural bob-tailed.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Old Time Farm Shepherd is set apart from closely related breeds by its temperament. The founder of the breed, J. Richard McDuffie described them this way \"They have almost human intelligence, being able to figure things out and respond appropriately to unusual situations. They are very people-oriented but distrustful of strangers.\" Old Time Farm Shepherds are often very sensitive or \"soft\", easily trainable, eager to please but also easily damaged by harsh words.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, these dogs were common on farms across America. They were called shepherds or collies. After World War II, people's fancies turned to registered dogs and the farm shepherds began a slow decline. By the 1980s, farm shepherds were almost extinct in America, McDuffie then began a nationwide search for the dogs he remembered from his youth using his column in Full Cry Magazine as a vehicle to reach out to others. From the hundreds of responses he received, he eventually located a family in Central Tennessee who had kept a line of these dogs pure for generations. In the spring of 1994 McDuffie drove to Brush Creek, Tennessee and bought the last litter of 4 pups produced by this family. McDuffie found another line of farm shepherds in Western Tennessee where he acquired 2 females. With these 6 dogs, McDuffie founded the Old Time Farm Shepherd breed and began registering them with the National Kennel Club.As of October 2010 McDuffie's dog, Dunrovin's Ole Shep had contributed to the pedigrees of over 30 of the 135 registered working farm collies of the American Working Farmcollie Association, more than any other single dog. Most of these descendants registered as English Shepherd.\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\n\n=== Hunting ===\nMcDuffie sought out and bred Old Time Farm Shepherds for their hunting and treeing ability. He used his dogs to hunt raccoon, squirrel, and opossum.  McDuffie was adamant that the working traits in this breed be maintained and that selection must continue in the same manner as it had for generations or the breed would change.\n\n\n=== Farm work ===\nOld Time Farm Shepherds are often employed as multi-purpose dogs on small farms. As the descendants of the old working Scotch Collies they possess all the instinct and ability of their forebears, including herding, guardian and pest control. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Old Time Farm Shepherds that exhibit basic herding instincts can also be trained to compete in farm dog trials. McDuffie was adamant that selection by herding trials would not result in the same breed of dog.Old-Time Farm Shepherds have a specialized motivation; they often move livestock out of a sense of rules and routine, and vary their working strategies to suit the situation. They are easy to train to leave the livestock alone unless the stock are not where they belong.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFarm collie\nScotch collie\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOld Time Farm Shepherd Breed Information and Pictures\nAmerican Working Farmcollie Association"}, {"id": 356, "name": "Olde English Bulldogge", "country": "United States", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog356", "description": "The Olde English Bulldogge is an American dog breed. In the 1970s David Leavitt created a true-breeding lineage as a re-creation of the healthier working bulldog from early nineteenth century England. Using a breeding scheme developed for cattle, Leavitt crossed English bulldogs, American Bulldogs, Bull Mastiffs and American Pit Bull Terriers. The result was an athletic breed that looks similar to the bulldogs of 1820, but also has a friendly temperament with less health issues. Pure breed Olde English Bulldogges can be registered under the International Olde English Bulldogge Association  and other respected Associations.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Olde English Bulldogge was an attempt to recreate the \"Regency Period Bull Baiter\" and was developed in the early 1970s by David Leavitt, of Coatesville, PA. Leavitt began his project in 1971 utilizing the cattle line breeding scheme of Dr. Fechimer from Ohio State University. The goal was to create a dog with the look, health, and athleticism of the original bull-baiting dogs, but with a much less aggressive temperament. The foundation crosses consisted of one-half English Bulldog, one-sixth American Bulldog, one-sixth Bull Mastiff and one-sixth of other breeds. After many planned crosses, the Olde English Bulldogge emerged and began to breed true.Leavitt formed the Olde English Bulldogge Association (OEBA) to maintain the breed's stud book and issue registration papers to future offspring. During the 1980s Ben and Karen Campetti from Sandisfield, Massachusetts worked closely with Leavitt in breeding the Olde English Bulldogge. In 1993 Leavitt stopped breeding and turned the OEBA registry as well as his personal breeding stock over to Working Dog Inc. which was owned and operated by Michael Walz of Pennsylvania.In 2001 the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club (OEBKC) was formed, and in 2005 David Leavitt was involved with merging the Olde English Bulldogge Association's registry with that of the OEBKC's. The Olde English Bulldogge was enrolled with the Canine Developmental Health and Performance Registry (CDHPR) in August 2008 in order to evaluate the breed for recognition within the UKC as a purebred breed of dog and in 2013 the UKC announced that the Olde English Bulldogge would become a fully recognized breed as of January 1, 2014. The OEBKC is currently the recognized Parent Club for the breed with the United Kennel Club (UKC).\n\n\n=== Leavitt Bulldog ===\n\nIn order to maintain his original breeding aims and to distinguish his line of Olde English Bulldogges from those of other breeders, in 2004 David Leavitt named his line of dogs Leavitt Bulldogges, founding the Leavitt Bulldog Association the following year.  The UKC recognises dogs registered with the Leavitt Bulldog Association as Olde English Bulldogges, along with those registered with the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club and the Olde Bulldogge Club Europe.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Olde English Bulldogge is a muscular, medium-sized dog of great strength, and possesser of fluid, agile movement. They are well balanced and proportioned, while appearing capable of performing without any breathing restrictions in either heat or in cold. Serious Faults: Excessive wrinkle, lack of pigment around eyes, nose or mouth.\n\nThe skull is large and well-proportioned to the dog\u2019s muscular body and prominent shoulders. There is a defined furrow between the eyes (from the stop to the occiput). Narrow skull and domed forehead are faults. The muzzle is square, wide and deep. \nBite is undershot or reverse scissors. Lower jawbone is moderately curved from front to back.\nNostrils are wide, with a line running vertically between nostrils from the tip of nose down to the bottom of the upper lip. Nose is large and broad in relationship to the width of the muzzle. Nose color is black.\nEyes are medium in size and almond shaped, dark to light brown, with black pigmented eye rims. They are set wide and low, level with the top of the muzzle. Ears are small, rose, button or tulip. Rose is preferred. They are set high, wide and to the back outer edge of the skull. The neck is medium length, wide, and slightly arched. The body is sturdy, powerful and slightly rectangular when viewed from the side. Chest is wide and deep. Hind legs are well muscled and have the appearance of being slightly longer than the forelegs. The hind legs should be straight, parallel and set apart. Accepted color patterns include brindle, and solid colors, with or without white. Males should be 60 to 80 pounds, and 17 to 20 inches at the withers, while females should be 50 to 70 pounds, and 16 to 19 inches at the withers.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nThe Olde English Bulldogge may be a healthier breed of dog than many modern Bulldog breeds, though they can be affected by many of the same disorders that occur in any breed. Proponents of the breed maintain that it does not suffer from the same disorders as purebred English bulldogs. Many breeders are now x-raying hips to reduce the incidence of hip dysplasia as well as having dogs evaluated by organizations such as the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) and the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). The Olde English Bulldogge is also quickly becoming well respected in many working venues such as weight pull, therapy training, and obedience. They have become excellent breathers, but still are very sensitive to heat. Artificial insemination is not a standard protocol when breeding Olde English Bulldogges; natural ties are the standard. Breeders from the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club are working vigorously on educating new breeders on genetic disorders and the benefits modern genetic testing for these disorders can have on preventing genetic disorders in domestic animals. Many breeders are also becoming more aware of how important selective breeding can be to the breed as a whole.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBulldog breeds\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDePrisco, Andrew (1990).

It is a scent hound and is currently recognised by the Kennel Club as a Vulnerable Native Breed with around 600 animals worldwide.\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\nThe first recorded Otterhounds known to resemble the current breed are in the North-West of England in the first half of the 19th century \u2013 for example, the Hawkstone Otter Hunt and Squire Lomax's Otterhounds. In the second half of the 19th century, French Griffons were outcrossed, including one-eighth Wolf cross/Griffon Vendeen from the Comte de Canteleu in Normandy. In the early 20th century the Griffon Nivernais was crossed into the breed, and one particular dog, Boatman, a Grand Griffon Vendeen/Bloodhound cross, became an ancestor for several kennels.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Otterhound is a large, rough-coated hound with an imposing head. Originally bred for hunting, it has great strength and a strong body with long striding steps. This makes it able to perform prolonged hard work. The Otterhound hunts its quarry both on land and in water and it has a combination of characteristics unique among hounds; most notably an oily, rough, double coat and substantial webbed feet. They have a nose that can track in the mud and water for over 72 hoursOtterhounds generally weigh between 80 and 115 pounds (36 and 52 kg). They have extremely sensitive noses which make them inquisitive and perseverant in investigating scents. Consequently, they need particular supervision when outdoors. They are friendly dogs with a unique bass voice which they use frequently.\n\n\n== Hunting ==\n\nOtter hunting dates back to the early medieval period, with references it is found as early as 1360. The Otterhound, however, can only be traced back as a distinct breed as far as the early 1800s.\nThe otter is one of the largest and most intelligent carnivorous mammals in Europe. To be equal to the otter, an Otterhound was said to need \"a Bulldog's courage, a Newfoundland's strength in water, a Pointer's nose, a Retriever's sagacity, the stamina of a Foxhound, the patience of a Beagle, and the intelligence of a Collie\".\nIn 1978, due to the dramatic decline in otter numbers, the otter was placed on the list of protected species in Britain and otterhunting therefore ceased. Otterhunting was never banned in Britain but a voluntary stop was made by the otterhunts as it was they who realised that the otters' numbers were dropping dramatically and brought it to the attention of the authorities. By 1977, nine registered packs of otterhounds were still in existence. A few hunts switched to hunting mink or coypu, but many of the original otterhound packs hunts ceased to exist altogether. Hounds were often passed to newly founded minkhound packs. The Pembroke and Carmarthenshire Minkhounds are the only pack today with a pure otterhound pack. As the dogs had been selectively bred for their hunting capabilities, only a few of the bloodlines were suitable for breeding into companion animals.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe average lifespan of the breed is a little over 10 years. A quarter will live 12 to 15 years. At least one hound is known to have  lived to be 16 years old.\nThe Otterhound enjoys considerable exercise, but can also be a couch potato. They can be good family dogs but need to be kept in a secure property since they can jump fences up to 5 feet high, but rarely try.\nIn spite of the small gene pool, the Otterhound is generally a healthy breed, but is subject to many of the same complaints as all large, rapidly growing dogs.\nCommon problems that can occur are elbow and hip dysplasia, a malformation of the elbow and hip joints. These are not always painful, but can cause lameness and impair mobility, and result in arthritis. Badly affected hounds should not be bred from, but most Otterhounds have a poor hip and elbow score. The problem can be reduced by making sure that young Otterhounds do not jump down from high places, go up and down the stairs or walk too much on very hard surfaces while bones are still growing. This enables the muscles around the sockets to strengthen and develop, providing more support.\nOtterhounds have a predisposition to ear problems (as can any breed with this type of ear) and a predisposition to gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), due to their deep chest. \nEpilepsy and seizures are also known to affect the breed, and can be hereditary. There is ongoing research into the causes of epilepsy in Otterhounds. For reasons currently unknown, epilepsy in Otterhounds in the United States does not appear to be fatal, while epilepsy found Otterhounds from the United Kingdom is frequently untreatable, and is usually fatal.\n\n\n== Endangered breed ==\n\nThere are an estimated 599 Otterhounds in the world. It is considered to be the most endangered native breed in Britain, with only 41 new registrations in 2016. This is partially because Otterhounds have never been numerous, and even in the early 20th century, when otter hunting was at the height of its popularity as a sport, the number of dogs was still small. They are on the list of Vulnerable Native Breeds as identified by the UK Kennel Club, and great efforts are being made to save the breed.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nLeighton, Robert (2004).

It was formerly believed that this unusual nose gives it extra sensitivity to smells, a primary reason it was chosen as a hunting dog. Today, it is known that this feature is only a cosmetic difference.  The variety is also known by other names:  Navarra pointer, Spanish: pach\u00f3n de Victoria and perdiguero Navarro; Basque: nafarroako eper txakur.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe modern pach\u00f3n Navarro is a braque-type hunting dog which points to game. It has short hair that may be brown and white, or orange and white, commonly ticked like the coat of most German Shorthaired Pointers. The head and large patches on the coat are generally solid-colored.\nWith a broad head, the dog is a substantially large animal, weighing between 27 and 33 kg (60 and 73 lb) and having a height between 48 and 57 cm (19 and 22 in).

This breed is associated with shepherd families of that region. PandiKona dogs need very little care.\nThe Indian Pandikona is one of the forgotten breeds from Andra Pradesh. The Pandikona is named after the location where it is found. Pandikona is located near Kurnool district in Andhra Pradesh. The area is considered dangerous to outsiders because of warring factions and political differences. This highly territorial breed is used to guard villages, property and livestock and to hunt any available game. Their territorial nature and sharp tempers often result in fights with neighboring dogs that trespass onto its territory. Since Pandikona is a small village with overlapping property boundaries and most homes has 2 to 3 dogs, it is quite natural for dogs to posture and get into occasional squabbles over borders. Most of the squabbles end in one dog retreating and no serious injuries. Villagers do not normally intercede in the dogs territorial battles. These intelligent and independent dog are never chained but roam freely among the village and do not take directions from their owners. They are normally within the vicinity of their property and take their guarding duties seriously. When bored or satisfied with the security of their owners home the dogs will go to the owners farm and continue guarding duties. Ideally suited for guarding or hunting duties the Pandikona is a fierce protector that is tolerant of errant children and young strays but are deadly serious with adults. The Pandikona will normally warn the intruder to stay away but the warning is fleeting and the impending attack carried out swiftly and with great intensity. Adult Pandikona dogs are focused and confident in their abilities to defend and will exercise some judgment when confronted with a young person or juvenile animal. Their hunting function is performed in the traditional way with weapons that have been used for generations. Normally done with a spear or \"ballem\" which is a sharp metal end affixed to a stick. Hunting in this way exposes the hunter and the dogs to grave danger from boars and other animals. The dogs hunt in packs with a leaders established by pack order and all territorial disagreements are forgotten during the hunt. Typically the leader has the best nose and bite and goes in hunt for the boar with the pack following at a discrete distance. It is said that the pack has a complex communication system which enables the leader to warn the pack of dangers such as snakes, scorpions and if it has found the quarry. If the prey is very large the leader will take the first bite and bring the prey down. If the prey is not very challenging the leader will allow the junior leader to take the first bite and bring the quarry down with the other joining in the kill. \nPups join the hunt between 6 and 8 months of age.\n\n\n== Size ==\nThe Pandikona shows wide variations in size as the local breeders never chain their dogs and are not given to selective breeding. The dogs are always left untied and can range from 20-26 inches (males) and 19-24 inches (females).\n\n\n== Coat Colours ==\n\nThe breed is essentially short-haired with colours varying from solid fawn, shades of cream, white to black with white patches. All colours are seen with brindle being the rarest.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Pandikona has an exceptional instinct for guarding and hunting. They are fearless and show a surprising instinct even as puppies of being territorial. They are very faithful and good with children though not overly playful. They are used for hunting wild boar, hare and even rabbits.\nThey are also known to kill snakes and rodents.\nThe Pandikona can become a good companion dog with frequent and strong socialization at the earliest age but is most comfortable on the job of hunting or guarding.\n\n\n== Breeding ==\nFemale dogs are known to come into heat twice a year and litter sizes range from generally 4-7 puppies. \nIn the native village breeding is completely natural with more than one male mating with a female.\n\n\n== Future Prospects ==\nThe Pandikona is an ideal guardian and hunting companion requiring little or no veterinary care as they are hardy, robust dogs which are not plagued by genetic defects brought on by selective and irresponsible breeding by humans. The only way to acquire a puppy though is to travel to the Pandikona village whose people only give puppies away to outsiders who they believe really will take good care of the dogs. Further awareness and efforts are required to popularise this ancient sighthound breed of India.\n\n\n== References ==\nFacebook Page"}, {"id": 360, "name": "Paisley Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom, Scotland", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog360", "description": "The Paisley Terrier was a breed of terrier type dog that is now extinct. Originating in Scotland, the Paisley Terrier was bred primarily as a pet and showdog version of the Skye Terrier, and was the progenitor of today's Yorkshire Terrier. The breed was called the Paisley terrier since most of the dogs came from that location, but it was also called the Clydesdale Terrier, for another location in the Clyde Valley where the dogs were bred.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n  \nThe appearance of the Paisley terrier was similar to the Skye Terrier, but was shorter backed and weighed around 7 kg (16 lbs), about half the weight of today's Skye Terrier. The breed had a flowing \"silvery, soft jacket\" (coat) of blue and tan, and was shown along with the hard-coated Skye Terriers. They were further described as having a great profusion of silky fur with very profuse ear feathering (long hair on the ears.) To differentiate it from the Skye, it was nicknamed the Silky. From the earliest time of the breed, the beauty of the coat won prizes at dog shows. Traditionally, the dogs were shown standing on a box, so that the length of the silky coat could be shown to its best advantage.The Paisley Terrier was described in 1894 as \"an excellent house dog, and most suitable for a lady who wishes something more substantial than a toy\", but the care requirements for the coat made it less desirable than some other popular breeds as a pet.\n\n\n== History ==\n \nIn a book written in 1894, the author speculate that the Paisley Terrier was created by fanciers in Glasgow who selected Skye Terriers with short backs and long, silky coats \"until they bred fairly truly\".Describing the Paisley Terrier in 1894, Rawdon Lee writes that \"Though he can kill rats, and maybe other vermin, the Paisley Terrier is essentially a pet dog, and is usually kept as such.\"  The breed was primarily a pet, and it was also a popular showdog. In 1903, the breed is referred to as \"a fancier's dog, a sport from the Skye Terrier stock\" and despite some fanciers of the time claiming that the breed had the \"hardiness and fitness for terrier work... it is evident that a dog with a coat that looks like silk is simply a toy.\" Owners and breeders in the 1800s placed a high value on the beautiful blue and tan coat, and would cover the dog's feet and tie the hair back over their eyes to keep the coat looking at its best for dog shows.The Kennel Club recognised the Paisley Terrier in 1888 as a variety of the Skye Terrier, even though separate show classes had been held for the two types in 1887. However, there were so few entries that the Kennel Club did not continue to encourage offering the category at further exhibitions.The breed's success as a showdog may have led to its decline. Judges would give awards to the dogs with the long, attractive coat, since length of coat was a principal factor in Skye Terriers. The Paisleys, bred for long but soft coats (useless for a working dog), would win the prizes. Skye Terrier fanciers objected to the type being shown with Skyes, since they considered the Paisleys to be mixed breeds or possibly crossed with Dandie Dinmonts. The interest of fanciers declined, and the breed began to disappear.A book published in 1918 describes Paisley Terriers as uncommon and \"I doubt that you'll ever see one in the United States.\" But with the availability of internet based dog registries that will register breeds with little or no documentation, combined with the public's appetite for unique or rare pets, it is likely that there will be attempts to reconstitute the breed.\n\n\n== Continuing influence ==\nThe famous 1860s showdog Huddersfield Ben came from Paisley Terrier stock in the 1860s, and is considered by all authorities to be the founding sire of the Yorkshire Terrier breed, although the Yorkshire Terrier was not recognised as a separate breed until 1898. When the Paisley Terrier went into decline, the smaller and more popular Yorkshire variety superseded it. Through the Yorkshire, the Paisley Terrier is also the ancestor of several other modern breeds, notably the Australian Silky Terrier and the Biewer Terrier.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHuddersfield Ben\nYorkshire Terrier\nDog terminology\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHistory of the Yorkshire Terrier by Joan Gordan"}, {"id": 361, "name": "Papillon (dog)", "country": "Spain, Belgium, France", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog361", "description": "The Papillon (French pronunciation: \u200b[papij\u0254\u0303], French for 'butterfly[-eared]'), also called the Continental Toy Spaniel, is a breed of dog, of the spaniel type. One of the oldest of the toy spaniels, it derives its name from its characteristic butterfly-like look of the long and fringed hair on the ears.  A Papillon with dropped ears is called a Phal\u00e8ne (French for 'moth'). The small head is slightly rounded between the ears with a well-defined stop. The muzzle is somewhat short and thin, tapering to the nose. The dark, medium-sized, round eyes have thin, black rims, often extending at the junction of the eyelids towards the ears. The large ears can either be erect or dropped with rounded tips. The teeth meet in a scissors bite. The long tail is set high carried over the body, and covered with long, fine hair. Dewclaws are sometimes removed. The straight, long, fine, single coat has extra frill on the chest, ears, back of the legs, and tail. Coat color is white with patches of any color. A mask of a color other than white covers both ears and eyes from back to front.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance and behavior ===\nPapillons are very intelligent and self-assured dogs that have a very easy time learning new tricks. These dogs can be sociable with children and strangers, but are generally reserved around new people.  They can also be socialized to get along well with other pets, but care should be taken with rambunctious pets or cats with claws, as they may injure them. If not properly socialized, Papillons can be distrustful and exhibit aggressive tendencies toward other dogs and people. Papillons may also be very playful and affectionate. Widely known as great companion dogs, they have the spirit and energy to keep up with active families, but can also be calm enough to be happy with sleeping in the arms of an equally affectionate owner. Due to their high energy level, they demand an augmented exercise routine, relative to the average companion breed. Papillons are known as excellent watchdogs, as they will alert their owner to changes in their environment. They may be considered garrulous like many other toy dogs. They can withstand heat, but are more sensitive to cold temperatures because of their single-coated fur, and should not be left outside unattended in cold weather. \n\nThe most iconic aspect of Papillons are their ears, which are large and well fringed, giving them a butterfly wing-like appearance. Papillons are particolored or white with patches of any color. An all-white dog or a dog with no white is disqualified from the conformation show ring. A blaze (area of white extending down between the eyes) and noseband is preferred over a solid-colored head, but not required. Nose, eye rims, and lips should be black. Paw pads vary in color from black to pink, depending on the coloring of the dog.\nPapillons can be registered with the American Kennel Club as the following colors and markings, with types for show purposes indicated with S for standard or A for alternate:\nThe American Kennel Club breed standard indicates a conformance fault that may be penalized: failure of the non-white color to cover the front and back of both ears and to extend from the ears over both eyes.  Not penalized are a slight extension of the white collar onto the base of the ears, or a few white hairs interspersed in the color \u2013 as long as \"the butterfly appearance is not sacrificed\".\nTwo ear variations of this breed are seen, the completely upright ears of the more common Papillon, and the dropped spaniel-like ears of the Phal\u00e8ne. The Phal\u00e8ne are likely a throwback to their spaniel ancestors. The American Kennel Club and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) consider the Phal\u00e8ne and the Papillon the same breed.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe temperament of Papillons is happy, friendly, adventurous dogs. They are not shy or aggressive. Papillons make excellent family dogs, but should be watched around little children, as should any dog, due to a small child's lack of understanding of a dog's behavior and the likelihood that they will do something to upset the dog. Given the intelligence of Papillons, they should also be given rigorous training and mental stimulation to prevent behavioral issues arising from boredom.\n\n\n=== Lifespan ===\nA 2002 Papillon Club of America survey found that the  Papillons of their members lived an average of 11.45 years. Papillons can live up to 17 years.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nPapillons have only minor health concerns, although patellar luxation, seizures, and dental problems can be issues.  Additionally, they can be at risk for progressive retinal atrophy, intervertebral disk disease, and allergies.\n\n\n=== Exercise ===\nPlay will take care of a lot of their exercise needs; however, as with all breeds, play is not sufficient for all exercise. Daily walks or runs are an excellent way to exercise a Papillon. They also enjoy a good romp in a safe open area off leash, such as a large, fenced yard. Papillons are a very active breed of dog and enjoy having a job to perform. Papillon breeders recommend dog agility, rally obedience, or obedience training for Papillons because of their intelligence and energy level.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of the Papillon is traced through works of art. The earliest toy spaniels resembling the papillon are found in Italy. Tiziano Vicelli painted these small dogs in many famous paintings beginning around 1500, including the Venus of Urbino (1542). Other well-known artists who included them in paintings are Watteau, Gonzales Coques, Fragonard, Paolo Veronese, and Mignard.  In a painting after Largillierre in the Wallace Collection in London, a Papillon is clearly shown in a family portrait of Louis XIV. Papillons are also in paintings of royal families around Europe and paintings of merchant-class families. The breed was popular in England, France, and Belgium, which are considered countries of origin by the FCI.\nThe \"Titian spaniels\" and those portrayed by later artists through Mignard and his contemporaries had the drooping ears characteristic of today's Phal\u00e8ne;  the erect-eared appearance did not become fashionable until the end of the 19th century.  The Titian spaniels were also exclusively red-and-white in coloration, in contrast to the many recognized colorations of today's Papillon.\nThe Papillon's history and long association with royalty have led to many stories about the breed. Marie Antoinette is said to have walked to the guillotine clutching her small dog under her arm, likely an apocryphal tale. However, tradition has it that Marie Antoinette's dog was a small spaniel that had been brought to the French court from Spain on the back of pack mules. According to the story, her pup was spared and cared for in a building in Paris still called the Papillon House. Marie Antoinette's dog was said to have descended from a very old drop-eared breed known as the Epagneul Nain, or Continental Dwarf/Toy Spaniel that appeared in church frescos and paintings as early as the 13th century.\nThe Papillon is still officially referred to as the Epagneul Nain (ENC) in non-English-speaking countries.  The name Squirrel Spaniel also has been used, most likely referring to an earlier standard in which the tail set is described as \"curling over the back as a squirrel's\". One version of the history of the two varieties of ear shape in the ENC (\"papillon\" to denote the erect ear and \"phal\u00e8ne\" to denote the dropped ear) is that toward the end of the 19th century, breed fanciers bred a version of the spaniel whose ears stood up. This dog was said to have been nicknamed papillon based on the impressively large, erect ears that resembled the wings of a butterfly. The drop-eared variety of the breed came to be called the Phal\u00e8ne (which means \"night moth\"). Both types are still bred today and appear in the same litter. The papillon variety is much more common, although recently, the Phal\u00e8ne has undergone a resurgence in popularity.\nThe Papillon was first recognized by the AKC in 1935 with the formation of the Papillon Club of America. By the end of the war, the club was no longer functioning, but it was reactivated in 1948, with its first postwar specialty held in September 1954. In 1999, Ch. Loteki Supernatural Being (call name \"Kirby\") owned and handled by John Oulton of Norwalk, Connecticut, became the first Papillon to win the prestigious \"Best in Show\" at the annual Westminster Kennel Club dog show.  Kirby also won international success for the breed by taking the World Dog Show in Helsinki, Finland, and the Royal Invitational in Canada in 1998.  Papillons also enjoy success today in competitive fields outside of conformation, including obedience and agility.\nPapillon portraits\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nLap dog\nCompanion dog\nCompanion Dog Group\nToy Group\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPapillon at Curlie"}, {"id": 362, "name": "Parson Russell Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog362", "description": "The Parson Russell Terrier is a breed of small white terrier that was the original Fox Terrier of the 18th century. The breed is named after the Reverend John \"Jack\" Russell, credited with the creation of this type of dog. It is the recognised conformation show variety of the Jack Russell Terrier and was first recognised in 1990 in the United Kingdom as the Parson Jack Russell Terrier. In America, it was first recognised as the Jack Russell Terrier in 1997. The name was changed to its current form in 1999 in the UK and by 2008 all international kennel clubs recognised it under the new name.\nA mostly white breed with either a smooth, rough or broken coat, it conforms to a narrower range of sizes than the Jack Russell. It is a feisty, energetic terrier, suited to sports and able to get along with children and other animals. It has a range of breed-related health issues, mainly relating to eye disorders.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis breed shares a common history with the Jack Russell Terrier until the early 1980s.This type of small white terrier dates back to the work of the Reverend John Russell, born in 1795. In 1819 he purchased a small white and tan terrier bitch named Trump from a milkman in the hamlet of Elmsford. She formed the basis for his breeding programme, and by the 1850s the dogs were recognised as a distinct type of Fox Terrier.In 1894, the Devon and Somerset Badger Club was founded by Arthur Blake Heinemann who created the first breed standard for this type of terrier. The club was formed with the aim of promoting badger digging, rather than fox hunting. By the turn of the 20th century, the name of John Russell had become associated with this type of terrier. The Devon and Somerset Badger Club would go on to be renamed the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club and continued until just before World War II when the club folded.In 1983, the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club (PJRTC) was reformed with the aim of seeking Kennel Club recognition for the breed. The initial application was turned down, but after several further rejections, the Parson Jack Russell Terrier was recognised on 9 January 1990 as a variant of the Fox Terrier, with the United Kennel Club following suit in 1991. The American Kennel Club recognised the breed as the Jack Russell Terrier effective 1 November 1997.On 1 August 1999, the PJRTC successfully petitioned the Kennel Club (UK) to change the name of the breed to the Parson Russell Terrier, with the name of the breed club following suit. The international kennel association, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, recognised the Parson Russell Terrier on 4 June 2001. The American Kennel Club updated the name of the recognised breed from Jack Russell Terrier on 1 April 2003. The United Kennel Club adopted the new name on 23 April 2008.The Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC), New Zealand Kennel Club and United Kennel Club (UKC) are the only three major kennel clubs to recognise both the Jack Russell Terrier and the Parson Russell Terrier separately. In 2009, there were 18 Parsons registered with the ANKC compared to 1073 Jack Russells.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Parson Russell Terrier is bred to conform to a conformation show standard. Unlike its close relative, the Jack Russell Terrier, Parson Russell Terriers have noticeably longer legs that are about as tall as the length of the Terrier's body.  It is a predominantly white breed with black, tan or tricolour markings and an easy to groom coat which is either smooth or broken (similar to a smooth coat, but with some longer hair on the head, face, legs or body). The breed standard does not recognise a Parson Russell with a curly or rough coat. There is a clear outline with only a hint of eyebrows and beard should the dog be broken coated. They possess moderately thick small \"V\" shaped drop ears with the tip pointed towards the eyes. The nose of the dog should be black. The normal range of sizes is between 13\u201314 inches (33\u201336 cm) tall at the withers, with a weight around 13\u201317 pounds (5.9\u20137.7 kg).The Parson Russell has a relatively square outline, with a body about as long as the dog is tall. Compared to the Jack Russell Terrier, the Parson Russell has a longer head and a larger chest along with overall a slightly larger body size. The Parson retains the flat skull but not the elongated shape of the Fox Terrier, and with lower set ears. In addition, the Jack Russell Terrier has a greater variation in size, ranging between 10\u201315 inches (25\u201338 cm) in height at the withers.Two hands should be able to span the chest of the dog behind its elbows, with the thumbs at the withers. This is required in show judging, with the judge lifting the dog's front legs gently off the ground in this motion in order to measure the size of the chest. The judges fingers should meet under the chest and the thumbs on top of the spine. The American Kennel Club describes this as a \"significant factor and a critical part of the judging process.\" It is not done to measure the size of the chest, but rather to feel for the correct shape.Under the show standard, there are several physical points which would be treated as faults in the show ring. These are for the height of the dog at the withers to be outside of the standard range, or for the dog to possess either pricked up ears, a liver or brown coloured nose, an overshot or undershot jawline or to have brindle markings.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe Parson is a feisty and energetic type of Terrier. They can excel in dog sports such as flyball or agility and require vigorous exercise in order to prevent them from becoming bored and potentially destructive in the home. They can be suited to live with children but as they have a typical Terrier temperament, they will not tolerate rough handling. The AKC describes them as being single minded, tenacious and courageous when at work, while at home they can be exuberant, playful and affectionate. However, it is unusual for dogs of this breed to be involved in work, such as fox hunting, typical of a small white terrier, as they are more adapted to the show bench.They can be playful with other dogs, and get along with horses. The breed standard requires that shyness be treated as a fault, although it states that this should not be confused with submissiveness which is not treated as such. Overt aggression towards another dog is not accepted and is a criterion for disqualification in the show ring.\n\n\n== Health ==\nEye conditions which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation, a heritable condition. This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal and begin to disintegrate in affected dogs. The fibres support the lens of the eye, and their destruction can cause the lens to fall into the wrong location within the eye. If the lens falls into the anterior chamber of eyeball then a secondary glaucoma can occur, causing loss of vision. National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, broken down into three groups; clears, carriers, and affecteds.Other eye conditions which appear in the breed include cataracts in juveniles, corneal dystrophy, progressive retinal atrophy and posterior vitreous detachment. Non-eye breed related conditions which may affect a Parson are deafness and patella luxation. The average lifespan of a Parson Russell Terrier is between 14 and 15 years.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nParson Russell Terrier at Curlie"}, {"id": 363, "name": "Patterdale Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog363", "description": "The Patterdale Terrier is a breed of dog descended from the Northern terrier breeds of the early 20th century. The origins of the breed can be traced back to the Lake District, specifically to Ullswater Hunt master Joe Bowman, an early Border Terrier breeder.\nThe \"Patterdale Terrier\" is more of a \"type\" rather than a \"breed\", being the result of a culmination of working terrier breeds indigenous to the United Kingdom.The dogs were bred for the hunting and dispatch of the red fox in the rocky fells around the Lake District where a traditional digging dog was not always of great use. They were also used for badger control for many years.\nThe Patterdale made its way to the United States, where it is used for groundhog, raccoon, fox and nutria with great success.Today, the highly adaptable Patterdale Terrier excels worldwide not just at hunting a wide array of quarry, but in a number of canine sports, such as dog agility and terrier racing.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThere are a number of breed standards for the Patterdale Terrier. The most notable is that of the United Kennel Club (UKC) and the American Dog Breeders Association (ADBA), both in the United States, since the United Kingdom Kennel Club does not currently recognize the Patterdale Terrier.\nThe UKC standard states that dogs are between 25 and 40 centimetres tall, and specifies that dogs should be in fit, working condition. The UKC standard further specifies:\n\nAn active little terrier that presents a compact, balanced image. As a working terrier, they have to be capable of squeezing through very small passages underground to follow quarry. This breed is worked far more than it is shown, and breeders are primarily concerned with the practicality of the breed. This terrier must have a strong neck, the fortitude to hold its quarry at bay, the ability to squeeze into tight burrows, and great flexibility and endurance.\n\n\n==== Coat and Colour ====\n\nThe coat may be one of three types: \"smooth,\" \"broken,\" or \"rough.\"  \n\nSmooth coat: Short, glossy hair. Undercoat still usually present.\nBroken coat: Coarse. May be some longer whiskering on muzzle and chin.\nRough coat: Longer hair overall, including face, ears, and muzzle. Very thick, protective double coat.All coat types should have dense and coarse double coats that are harsh to the touch and weatherproof. \nColours include black, red, bronze, black and tan, chocolate, liver, or even liver and tan, along with the rare blue (which has a slate colored nose), and occasionally brindle, but never fully white. Any other colours, or larger patches of white away from the chest and toes, are indicative of cross-breeding, particularly with the Jack Russell Terrier.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nPatterdale Terrier puppies tend to be bold and confident beyond their capabilities. The Patterdale is known as a working terrier, rather than a show dog. Typical of terriers, whose work requires high energy and a strong drive to pursue prey, Patterdales are very energetic and can be difficult to socialize. Though also kept as pets, due to being bred for high-intensity work, they may tend towards being too energetic for a sedentary household life.\n\n\n== History ==\nThese dogs were carefully linebred by Joe Bowman, an Ullswater huntsman. The modern Patterdale Terrier is to the Fell Terrier what the Jack Russell Terrier is to Hunt terriers\u2014the indisputable leader in numbers and performance as a breed.The Patterdale was developed in the harsh environment in the north of England, an area unsuitable for arable farming and mostly too hilly for cattle. Sheep farming is the predominant farming activity on these hills. Since the fox is perceived by farmers as being predatory with respect to sheep and small farm animals, terriers are used for predator control. Unlike the dirt dens found in the hunt country of the south, the rocky dens found in the north do not allow much digging. As a consequence, the terrier needs to be able to bolt the fox from the rock crevice or dispatch it where it is found. The use of \"hard\" dogs to hunt foxes in this way was made illegal in England and Wales by the Hunting Act 2004, as it runs counter to the code of practice under the Act.\nIn the United States, the Patterdale Terrier was recognised by the United Kennel Club on January 1, 1995, but remains unrecognized by the American Kennel Club.\n\n\n== Dog sports ==\nIn recent years Patterdale Terriers have begun to compete in a number of modern dog sports including ones such as flyball and dog agility.  Trainable terriers with working drive are prized in flyball, and Patterdale Terriers are ideal competitors in multiple disciplines of the sport.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPatterdale Terrier at Curlie"}, {"id": 364, "name": "Pekingese", "country": "China", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog364", "description": "The Pekingese (also known as the Lion Dog, Peking Lion Dog, Pelchie Dog, or Peke) is an ancient breed of toy dog, originating in China. They are called Lion Dogs due to their resemblance to Chinese guardian lions (the Shih Tzu is also known as a Lion Dog in Chinese).\nThe breed was favored by royalty of the Chinese Imperial court as both a lap dog and companion dog, and its name refers to the city of Peking (Beijing) where the Forbidden City is located. The breed has several characteristics and health issues related to its unique appearance. Because of its desirable characteristics, the Pekingese has been part of the development of designer crossbreeds, such as the Peekapoo (crossed with a poodle) and Peke-a-tese (crossed with a Maltese).\nThe breed originated in  Western China in antiquity. Recent DNA analysis confirms that the Pekingese breed is one of the oldest breeds of dog, and one of the least genetically diverged from the wolf.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Pekingese breed is over 2000 years old and has hardly changed in all that time. One exception is that modern breeders and dog show judges seem to prefer the long-haired type over the more traditional spaniel-type coat.\nThe Pekingese's flat face and large eyes are some of the breeds most obvious characteristics.  The body is compact and low to the ground. Pekingese also have a muscular and durable body. The breed's unusual rolling gait may have been deliberately developed by breeding to prevent the court dogs from wandering in ancient times.\n\n\n==== Coat ====\nAll breed standards allow a wide range of color combinations. The majority of Pekingese are gold, red or sable. Cream, black, white, tan, black and tan and occasionally 'blue' or slate grey have appeared in the breed. The latter often has poor pigment and light eyes. Albino Pekingese (white with pink eyes) should be bred cautiously due to health problems that have been associated with albinism. The Pekingese sheds a lot.\nA black mask or a self-colored face is equally acceptable in show dogs. Regardless of coat color, the exposed skin of the muzzle, nose, lips and eye rims is black. They require a lot of grooming.\n\nThe Pekingese weigh from 7 to 14 lb (3.2 to 6.4 kg) and stand about 6\u20139 inches (15\u201323 cm) at the withers, however they can sometimes be smaller. These smaller Pekingese are commonly referred to as \"Sleeve\" Pekingese or just \"Sleeves\". The name is taken from ancient times, when emperors would carry the smallest of the breed in their sleeves. A Pekingese over 15 pounds is disqualified in the show ring.\nThe Pekingese is slightly longer than tall when measured from the forechest to the buttocks. The overall outline is an approximate ratio of 3 high to 5 long.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Pekingese has a median lifespan of 11.4 years in a UK Kennel Club survey.The leading cause of death for Pekingese, as for many other Toy breeds, is trauma. Top leading causes of organ systems include neurologic and cardiovascular, e.g., congestive heart failure. When diagnosed early and successfully treated with medication, a Pekingese with this problem can expect to live many years. A heart murmur is a potential sign of a problem, and must be evaluated by a veterinary cardiologist. Very often, the problem does not surface until the dog is 6 or more years old, so it is very difficult to screen the problem in a pup.\nThe other main problems of the breed are eye issues and breathing problems, resulting from its tiny skull and flattened face, and skin allergies (and hotspots). An especially common problem is eye ulcers, which may develop spontaneously. Pekingese may also develop keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye)  progressive retinal atrophy, along with glaucoma in which pressure is placed on the eye, leading to fluid drainage in the eye. The leading cause of this is improper development of the eye's filtration angles. The Pekingese should not be kept outside, as having flattened faces and noses can cause them to develop breathing problems, making it difficult for them to regulate their body temperature in overly hot or cold weather. Their long backs, relative to their legs, make them vulnerable to back injuries. Care should be taken when picking them up to give adequate support to the back: one hand under the chest, the other under the abdomen. Short legs give some Pekingese difficulty with stairs; older dogs may not be able to go up or down stairs alone.\nIn an effort to address the breathing difficulties caused by the breed's flat face, the Kennel Club (UK) significantly changed the breed standard in October 2008, removing the clause that the \"profile [should be] flat with nose well up between eyes\" and adding instead that the \"muzzle must be evident\". This was in response to public opinion following the BBC programme, Pedigree Dogs Exposed. The breed standards of two other flat-faced breeds, the Pug and English Bulldog, were soon also changed.\n\n\n== Care ==\nKeeping the Pekingese coat healthy and presentable requires daily brushing, and a trip to the groomer every 8\u201312 weeks.  One important thing for new owners to remember is that dogs intended as a house pet may be kept in a puppy cut which requires less maintenance than a show cut. It is also important to remove foreign materials from the eyes daily, and the creases on the face to prevent sores (hot spots). It is also necessary to keep and maintain the fur in the buttocks of the Pekingese clean and well groomed as the area is prone to soiling.\nDue to their abundance of fur, it is important to keep the Pekingese cool. The breed is prone to have heatstroke when exposed to high temperature for a long time.\nPekingese exercise needs are minimal. Due to their extremely short snouts, they tend to have a high risk for breathing difficulties (most notably Brachycephalic obstructed airway syndrome). Because of this, around 30 minutes of exercise per day is enough to keep them healthy. It is important to monitor their breathing while exercising, especially if they are in the heat. If the Pekingese begins wheezing, exercise should cease immediately. After running, they should spend time resting in a cool place until their breathing returns to normal. They should also have access to plenty of water before, during, and after exercise to prevent overheating and dehydration.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe breed originated in China in antiquity. Recent DNA analysis confirms that the Pekingese breed is one of the oldest breeds of dog, one of the least genetically diverged from the wolf. For centuries, they could only be owned by members of the Chinese Imperial Palace.\nDuring the Second Opium War, in 1860, the Old Summer Palace in Beijing was occupied by a contingent of British and French troops. The Xianfeng Emperor had fled with all of his court to Chengde. However, an elderly aunt of the emperor remained. When the British and French troops entered, she committed suicide. She was found with her five Pekingese. They were removed by the Allies before the Summer Palace was burnt to the ground.Lord John Hay took a pair, later called Schloff and Hytien, and gave them to his sister, the Duchess of Wellington, wife of Henry Wellesley, 3rd Duke of Wellington. Sir George Fitzroy took another pair, and gave them to his cousins, the Duke and Duchess of Richmond and Gordon. Lieutenant Dunne presented the fifth Pekingese to Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, who named it Looty.The Empress Dowager Cixi presented Pekingese to several Americans, including John Pierpont Morgan and Alice Lee Roosevelt Longworth, daughter of Theodore Roosevelt, who named it Manchu.\nThe first Pekingese in Ireland was introduced by Dr. Heuston. He established smallpox vaccination clinics in China. The effect was dramatic. In gratitude, the Chinese minister, Li Hongzhang presented him with a pair of Pekingese. They were named Chang and Lady Li. Dr. Heuston founded the Greystones kennel.Around the turn of the century, Pekingese dogs became popular in Western countries. They were owned by such arbiters of fashion as Alexandra of Denmark (wife of Edward VII), and Elsie de Wolfe, popular American interior decorator.\n\n\n== Sleeve Pekingese ==\n\nAccording to the 1948 publication Dogs In Britain, A Description of All Native Breeds and Most Foreign Breeds in Britain by Clifford LB Hubbard, the Sleeve Pekingese is a true miniature of the standard-sized dog, and was also known as the Miniature Pekingese. The name Sleeve Pekingese came from the custom of carrying these small dogs in the capacious sleeves of the robes worn by members of the Chinese Imperial Household. Hubbard indicated that this tradition appeared to be early Italian rather than Chinese, but its adoption by the Chinese Imperial Household led to dogs being bred as small as possible and to practices aimed at stunting their growth: giving puppies rice wine, holding new-borns tightly for hours at a time or putting the puppies into tight-fitting wire mesh waistcoats. These practices were apparently forbidden by Dowager Empress Cixi.\nIn Hubbard's time, the term Sleeve was applied in Britain to a miniature Pekingese no more than 6\u20137 pounds in weight, often appearing to be only about 3\u20134 pounds. Mrs Flander's Mai Mai weighed only a little over 4 pounds and many other breeders had bred true miniatures of a similar size. He noted that miniatures may appear in a litter bred from full-sized Pekingese and were exhibited in classes for dogs less than 7 pounds at the major dog shows in Britain. In 1946 (when Hubbard wrote his book), the Sleeve Pekingese had a strong following with the most popular colours being cream and white, with white being considered particularly attractive. He illustrated the description with a white Sleeve Pekingese bred by Mrs Aileen Adam.\n\n\n== Quotation ==\n\nHer Imperial Majesty, Empress Dowager Cixi, (1835 \u2013 1908) said:\nLet the Lion Dog be small; let it wear the swelling cape of dignity around its neck; let it display the billowing standard of pomp above its back.Let its face be black; let its forefront be shaggy; let its forehead be straight and low.Let its eyes be large and luminous; let its ears be set like the sails of war junk; let its nose be like that of the monkey god of the Hindus.Let its forelegs be bent; so that it shall not desire to wander far, or leave the Imperial precincts.Let its body be shaped like that of a hunting lion spying for its prey.Let its feet be tufted with plentiful hair that its footfall may be soundless and for its standard of pomp let it rival the whick of the Tibetans' yak, which is flourished to protect the imperial litter from flying insects.Let it be lively that it may afford entertainment by its gambols; let it be timid that it may not involve itself in danger; let it be domestic in its habits that it may live in amity with the other beasts, fishes or birds that find protection in the Imperial Palace.And for its color, let it be that of the lion - a golden sable, to be carried in the sleeve of a yellow robe; or the colour of a red bear, or a black and white bear, or striped like a dragon, so that there may be dogs appropriate to every costume in the Imperial wardrobe.Let it venerate its ancestors and deposit offerings in the canine cemetery of the Forbidden City on each new moon.Let it comport itself with dignity; let it learn to bite the foreign devils instantly.Let it be dainty in its food so that it shall be known as an Imperial dog by its fastidiousness; sharks fins and curlew livers and the breasts of quails, on these may it be fed; and for drink give it the tea that is brewed from the spring buds of the shrub that groweth in the province of Hankow, or the milk of the antelopes that pasture in the Imperial parks.Thus shall it preserve its integrity and self-respect; and for the day of sickness let it be anointed with the clarified fat of the legs of a sacred leopard, and give it to drink a throstle's eggshell full of the juice of the custard apple in which has been dissolved three pinches of shredded rhinoceros horn, and apply it to piebald leeches.So shall it remain - but if it dies, remember thou too art mortal.\n\n\n== Legends ==\n\nThere are two origin stories for the Pekingese. The first is the most common, The Lion and the Marmoset:\n\nA lion and a marmoset fell in love. But the lion was too large. The lion went to the Buddha and told him of his woes. The Buddha allowed the lion to shrink down to the size of the marmoset. And the Pekingese was the result.The second, less-common, originating story is The Butterfly Lions:\n\nA lion fell in love with a butterfly. But the butterfly and lion knew the difference in size was too much to overcome. Together they went to see the Buddha, who allowed their size to meet in the middle. From this, the Pekingese came.Another legend says that the breed resulted from the mating of a lion and a monkey, getting its nobleness and coat from the former and its ungainly walk from the latter.\nBecause the Pekingese was believed to have originated from the Buddha, he was a temple dog. As such, he was not a mere toy. He was made small so that he could go after and destroy little demons that might infest the palace or temple. But his heart was big so that he could destroy even the largest and fiercest.  (Barbara Hambly's novel, Bride of the Rat God, was written from this premise, although Hambly denies knowledge of the legends.)\n\n\n== See also ==\nFoo Dog, dog breeds originating in China that resemble Chinese guardian lions and hence are also called Foo or Fu Dogs or Lion Dogs.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPekingese at Curlie"}, {"id": 365, "name": "Perro de Presa Canario", "country": "Spain", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog365", "description": "The Perro de Presa Canario, A.K.A. the Canary Mastiff, is a rare large Molosser-type dog breed originally bred for working livestock.  The name of the breed is Spanish, means \"Canarian catch dog\", and is often shortened to \"Presa Canario\" or simply \"Presa\".  The breed is sometimes also called Dogo Canario, meaning \"Canarian Molosser\". It is the animal symbol of the island of Gran Canaria.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nFirst introduced to the world outside of Spain's Canary Islands by the American anthropologist Dr. Carl Semencic in an article for Dog World Magazine and in his books on the subject of rare breeds of dogs, the Presa Canario or \"Canary Dog\" is a large-size dog with a thick and muscular body. The head is broad, massive, square, and powerful brachycephalic shape. Proper head and good expression are part of the breed standard, and are manifest in the best breed specimens. The ears are normally cropped, both to create a more formidable expression and to prevent damage while working with cattle. If cropped, the ears stand erect. In countries where ear-cropping is banned, the ears are close fitting to the head; they hang down and should be pendant or \"rose\" shaped. The upper lip is pendulous, although not excessively. Seen from the front, the upper and lower lips come together to form an inverted V. The flews are slightly divergent. The inside of the lips is a dark colour.Males have a standard desirable height range of 23 to 26 inches (58 to 66 cm) at the withers, with a minimum weight at maturity of 100 pounds (45 kg) and a maximum weight of 160 pounds (73 kg). Females have a standard desirable height between 22 to 25 inches (56 to 64 cm) at the withers, with a minimum weight at maturity of 85 pounds (39 kg) and a maximum weight of 70 kilograms (150 lb).The breed is also characterized by a sloping topline (with the rear being slightly higher than the shoulders). Another characteristic of the breed is the shape of the paws (cat foot) and the catlike movement of the animal. The body is mesomorphic, that is, slightly longer than the dog is tall, contributing to the feline movement.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe historian Agust\u00edn Millares Torres, in his \"General History of the Canary Islands\", said the derivation of large dogs that in these islands were [incomplete]. According to his research, these dogs took part in the myths, funeral customs and even gastronomy of the natives (Guanches) of the islands. Demons appeared to these people as big fleecy dogs, known as \"Tibicenas\" in Gran Canaria and \"Irnene\" on the island of La Palma. In the funerary cults, the dogs appear mummified beside their owners guides to the afterlife. The dogs were also consumed in small amounts, as has been proven in archaeological discoveries.\n\nIn the aftermath of conquest, the presence of these dogs of molosser morphology on the islands is well documented, especially in the cedularios of the councils of Fuerteventura and Tenerife. The first quote after conquest dates from 1501, which allowed the puerqueros (pig farmers) have \"one of the larges.\" In many periods, these dogs were used to kill the wild dogs that attacked cattle. Success was credited by the presentation of the skins of the heads. In others periods, many of these dogs were ordered to be killed for the damage they did to cattle. At one point, residents were given the opportunity to kill loose and wild dogs without punishment. In other occasions the dogs were ordered to be bound. And still other times, due to the damage caused by these dogs, their possession was banned for anyone who was not a farmer or a hunter. All this occurred between the 16th and 18th centuries.In addition to the traditional role of cattledog, the Perros de Presa have been used for dog fighting. Until the 1950s it remained common practice in all the islands. There exists ample testimony from former fans. The owners agreed on whether the fight had to be witnessed in silence or they could incite the animals. No spectator could touch or bother the dogs in combat. The most widespread method was to place the animals within a circle marked on the ground, face to face. The fight began when the collars were removed. These were not organized public events. Instead, they emerged sporadically at the challenge of the owners. However, practically the whole neighborhood participated in the show once it became aware of a fight. The fights were banned in the mid-1940s, but lasted for another decade. From this moment, due to tightening by the Francoist authority for the eradication of dogfighting, the Presa Canario is relegated to counted breeders that kept the breed preventing its total disappearance.\n\n\n== Coat and color ==\n\n \n\nThe coat is short with no undercoating and slightly coarse to the touch. The coat comes in all shades of fawn and brindle. The acceptance of the black coat is a point of contention among fanciers, as it is allowed by the AKC-FSS, UKC and UPPCC standards, but not by the FCI or FCI standards. White is allowed up to 20 percent and is most commonly found on the chest and feet, and occasionally on a blaze on the muzzle. The breed standard requires black pigmentation and dogs should have a black mask that does not extend above the eyes. The breed is renowned for its minimal shedding.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nPresas require early socialization and obedience training. In some situations, the Presa can be aggressive toward other dogs and suspicious of strangers. This breed of dog is sometimes used in dog fighting rings due to its size. \n\n\n== Health ==\nAs a large breed, the Presa Canario can be susceptible to hip dysplasia. Other reported health problems include dilated cardiomyopathy- heart problems and mast-cell tumours - cancer  patellar luxation and patellar evulsions, skin cysts, epilepsy, osteochondrodysplasias, demodectic mange and cryptorchidism and Canine leishmaniasis. The latter condition is described empirically as highly likely to affect dogs in areas of Spain and academically described as having increased over 22 years prior to 2006, with risk being highest for dogs that were older, large, lived outside, and lived at the meso-Mediterranean level.\n\n\n== Lifespan ==\nThe average lifespan for the Presa Canario is between 8 and 12 years.\n\n\n== Basis for the name and standard ==\nThe Presa Canario has a legislative basis in Spain in the form of recognition by a Real Decreto (Royal Decree) of the Ministro de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentaci\u00f3n (Minister of Agriculture Fishing and Nutrition), which was published in the Official Gazette of the Spanish Government (BOE \u2013 Boletin Oficial del Estado). The original Real Decreto 558/2001 can be read on the site of the Spanish Government Gazette. \nIn the decree, the breed is referred to as \"Presa Canario\". A breed standard is attached in the Royal Decree and it includes having a black coat and specifies a maximum weight.\nAny other name or standard is not recognized by Spanish law.\nIn Spain there are two main organizations which are legally recognized by the Minister of Agriculture, Fishing and Nutrition (according to the requirements set by the Real Decreto 558/2001): the RSCE and the FCE. The term \"legally recognized\" means that these organizations have the power to inscribe the litters into the official Book of Origins of Spain (LOE \u2013 Libro de Or\u00edgenes Espa\u00f1ol).\nThe FCE recognizes the breed according to Spanish law, and uses the Presa Canario name and standard, as set by the [Real Decreto 558/2001].\n[An official document] of the Spanish Government has been issued and sent to the RSCE to warn it and to invite it to modify its regulations.\nAnother recent legal source that identifies the breed is the [Real Decreto 1557/2005]. This decree also states the breed name as \"Presa Canario\" and gives the legislative power of official association recognition to the local governments.\n\n\n== Legal restrictions on ownership ==\nImportation and sale of the breed is prohibited in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDeath of Diane Whipple\nList of animal and plant symbols of the Canary Islands\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPerro de Presa Canario at Curlie"}, {"id": 366, "name": "Ca de Bou", "country": "Spain", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog366", "description": "Ca de Bou or Perro de Presa Mallorquin is a medium-to-large sized molossian-type breed of dog, with a strong, powerful, elongated build. The difference between the sexes is in the head, the circumference is greater in dogs than in bitches. The Perro de Presa Mallorquin was almost extinct after World War II, and the few remaining dogs were crossed with Majorca Shepherd Dog, Bulldog and perhaps Alano Espa\u00f1ol.  While extant specimens are all crossbred, the population as a whole retains standardized breed recognition in two kennel clubs, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, and United Kennel Club (using the FCI standard).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Balearic Islands are an archipelago of four large islands and eleven small islands in the Mediterranean off the east coast of Spain. Its culture and language are Catalan-based. The largest of these islands is Majorca (Mallorca).\nIn 1232, the King of Aragon expelled the Moors from the Balearics. The Spanish brought with them the Iberian mastiff. Many of today's Spanish breeds, of mastiffs, claim to be this breed; the Spanish Mastiff, the Pyrenean Mastiff, and the old Spanish Alano. Some Ca de Bestiar breeders believe that their dog was the breed that King James I brought over.\nThe first written mention of the Spanish Alano was in 1350 in King Alfonso XI's Book of Hunting. The Ca de Bestiar's origin on the island is dated as 16th or 17th century. In the French translation they refer to the Iberian Mastiff as an Iberican \"perro de presa\" (French: chien de combats); in English this is a Catch dog; this name can be given to any fierce breed whether Mastiff or Alano.\nThe King brought the Balearic islands into Aragon's Spain. Trading began between Majorca and Barcelona as well as France, while stopping the trade they did with Genoa and other Italian Republics during the Moorish occupation.\nMastiffs, Alanos and big herd dogs would have found their way to the island through trade and aristocrats settling down and bringing their dogs (Alanos in the 14th century were commonly used in hunting for boar and other wild animals, highly respected by aristocrats). All three of these breeds were probably crossed at different points for various functions.\nIn 1713, the English took over the Balearics at the Treaty of Utrecht. This is probably when the term \"Ca de Bou\" evolved. \"Ca de Bou\" is Catalan for \"bull-dog\" and it is a common mistake to understand this term as a visual element and not a function. In the case of the Ca de Bou, it is because of its function as a bull-baiter that it is named bull-dog.\nThe Ca de Bestiar was well regarded by the locals as a good herder and guardian. Their sizes and shapes would depend on the function people were looking for. The old Ca de Bestiar had large powerful bodies, strong necks and thick bones (Mastiff type), and there were also the smaller ones like in recent times. Whatever the function, they could withstand high temperatures.\nThe English during their reign of the island introduced the sport of bull-baiting. The common belief is that the English brought over Bulldogs and crossed them with the local guard/hunting/herd dog which could have been a mix of Alano, Ca de Bestiar and Iberian Mastiff.\nThe English Bulldog's origin is unclear, the first written mention in England was in 1632. Some people believe the breed originates in Spain, M.B. Wynn writes in his 1886 book, History of the Mastiff the following: \"It has been presumed without any decided proof that the Spanish bulldog was originally imported from England, but the truth of this is far from certain, and having inspected some of the most noted Spanish Bulldogs that have been imported to this country, I have come to the conclusion that although the Spanish bulldog is or was the remnant of the true Pugnaces, yet it differs considerably to the British Bulldog of modern age (19th century), in more characteristics than its greater size\".\nThe Spanish bulldogs imported to England in the late 19th century all weighed around 40 kilograms (88 lb), about the same as a Ca de Bou. In the standard it says that the English looked for a breed which would be well-suited for bullfighting. What better than Spanish Bulldogs, when being only 146 kilometres (91 mi) from Barcelona. The English would have known their bulldogs were not well adapted for the heat. Until then there was probably no reason to have low-to-the-ground dogs, but for bull-baiting it helps. This Perro de Toro, Spanish Bulldog was then crossed with the local Ca de Bestiar so that it could withstand the terrible heat of the island during the bullfight.\nThe English did not have an easy time in the Balearics. Forty-three years after the Treaty of Utrecht, the French (1756) invaded with a force of 12,000, after defeating the British under Admiral John Byng, captured Port Mahon. Restored to England in 1763, 19 years later the Spanish took it back (1782). The British seized it again in 1798, and it was finally ceded to Spain by the Peace of Amiens in 1803. The English left the island of Majorca in 1803, leaving behind the sport of bullbaiting. Bull and bear baiting were banned in England in 1835; in Spain it was not banned until 1883.\nThe Majorcans passed the dogs into other functions: guarding, hunting, holding the bull while the butcher came to end its life.\nIt was probably in the 19th century that the Ca de Bou acquired its look and typicity. The sport of bullbaiting was an expensive one, and the new sport and trend of dog fighting was spreading across Europe and the colonies. Different areas and countries had their fighting dogs. Their shape and sizes would depend on taste, climate, or surroundings. Even still in recent times, some people have said this breed is stronger than another.\n\nIn England where the sport began, they preferred bull and terrier crosses, they liked them small; in the USA they liked them bigger i.e. pit bulls. In France they liked big dogs to fight such as the Dogue de Bordeaux, which was 3 kinds back in the 19th century; Parisian  (Mastiff type), Bordelais (Bull-Mastiff, Dogue type), Toulousain (Spanish Bulldog type, longer muzzle, some believe it to be the Perro de Toro, as Toulouse is next to the Spanish border).\nIn Spain they had Perro de Presas, different types: the Spanish Alano, Perro de Toro (Spanish bulldog, heavier version of the Spanish Alano), and Perros de Tierra (low-to-the-ground dogs). In the Canary islands, they had Perro de Presa Canario. In Majorca, the Perro de Presa Majorquin (Ca de Bou) had been perfected for the climate and many functions, including that of fighting. Dog fights were not banned in Spain until 1940.\nThe first written mention of the Ca de Bou was in 1907, suggesting that the race was well known in the 19th century. The president of the Dogue de Bordeaux club spoke of them when the best of each breed met in Madrid, for a fight match in the 1920s.\nBy 1923, the breed was registered in the Spanish stud book, the first official entry was in 1928 and in 1929, the first Ca de Bous were shown at the Barcelona Dog show.\nThe famine of the 1920s and 1930s did not help the breed. In 1946, the standard was created, but it was not recognised by the FCI until 1964. By 1964 there were no pure specimens left, the trend for new breeds like German Shepherds, Great Dane and Rottweilers did not help the cause either. The breed was brought back to life in the 1980s. It had been crossed with the Ca de Bestiar; the Majorcans were still producing dogs based on functionality. Both Ca de Bous and Ca de Bestiar have their special qualities, so to cross them was not rare. From such specimens, they managed to find those that seemed to be more Ca de Bou than Ca de Bestiar.\nIn the nineties, other nations took interest in the breed. In Poland and Russia they found a lot of success.  There were rumours of more than 2,000 Ca de Bous in Moscow. There are only around 250 in Spain. The race is well-appreciated for its function in Puerto Rico, where the champion Chimo was sent to and other famous Spanish Ca de Bous. Other nations, including France, Holland, Denmark, Finland and Sweden, also have breeders but not many, and the breed is pretty well unknown. The first Ca de Bou was introduced to the UK from France in 2001 by a Mr. Williams of Gloucestershire.\nIn the 21st century, the Ca de Bou's future looks good. There is a bigger interest in the breed, with other names such as Mallorquin Mastiff, and thanks to the Internet, a closer link between Ca de Bou owners, breeders and passionate people, who love this breed. The increased interest carries with it potential pitfalls, however, as with the rapid development of other breeds when breeders try to match increased demand.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nAccording to the FCI standard, this dog should be a medium-sized, typical molosser with a slightly rectangular build. It is strong and powerful, with a deep and wide chest and a somewhat slimmer croup. The skin is thick and somewhat loose, but must not form folds except for a minor one on the throat.\nThe head is powerfully built and in males, the circumference of the skull should exceed the height of the dog. They have strong jaws with a very mild underbite, and widely spaced canines. The tail is set low, thick and is carried in a slight arch when the dog is moving.\nHeight and weight is for males 55\u201358 cm and 35\u201338 kg, for females 52\u201355 cm and 30\u201334 kg. It is a rather medium-sized dog, but can because of its mass appear larger than it really is.\nThe colors are fawn (light brown, often in deep tones), brindle, and black (often with tan markings). White markings are permitted, but must not exceed 30% of the full coat of the dog.\nThe size, shape and temperament varies greatly between lines. In central Europe, a far stockier dog with a shorter, slightly wrinkled face is more common. While in Spain, Scandinavia and other countries, the original, taller, leaner and more functional dog is most common.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThis is an intelligent dog who needs an owner who can understand and handle it. Owners should work with their Perro de Presa Mallorquin from puppy hood to teach obedience and manners in as positive a way as possible but correcting any unwanted behaviour from the beginning. Working with knowledgeable trainers is critical.\n\n\n== Exercise ==\nThe large Perro de Presa Mallorquin needs several long walks daily to stay physically and mentally sound. It is critical that it be properly socialized from puppyhood during these outings so that, as it grows and continues to be exercised. Participating in obedience classes and competitions is a great way to work with a Perro de Presa Mallorquin while exercising it.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCa de Bou information"}, {"id": 367, "name": "Peruvian Hairless Dog", "country": "Peru", "type": "Sighthound and Pariah", "picture": "dog367", "description": "The Peruvian Hairless Dog is a breed of dog with its origins in Peruvian pre-Inca cultures. It is one of several breeds of hairless dog.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nAccording to the FCI breed standard, the most important aspect of its appearance is its hairlessness. The dog may have short hair on top of its head, on its feet, and on the tip of its tail. In Peru, breeders tend to prefer completely hairless dogs. The full-coated variety is disqualified from conformation showing.\nThe color of skin can be chocolate-brown, elephant grey, copper, or mottled. They can be totally one color or one color with tongue pink spots. Albinism is not allowed. The eye color is linked to the skin color. It is always brown, but dogs with light colors can have clearer eyes than darker-skinned dogs.\nPeruvian Hairless Dogs vary in size :\n\nSmall 25 \u2013 40 cm (10 \u2013 16 inches)\nMedium 40 \u2013 50 cm (16 \u2013 20 inches)\nLarge 50 \u2013 65 cm (20 \u2013 26 inches)Weight is also varied according to size :\n\nSmall  4 \u2013 8 kg (9 \u2013 18 lbs)\nMedium  8 \u2013 12 kg (18 \u2013 26 lbs)\nLarge  12 \u2013 25 kg (26 \u2013 55 lbs)The dogs should be slim and elegant, with the impression of force and harmony, without being coarse.\nThe ears should be candle-flame shaped and erect with the possibility to lay flat.\nProportions of height (at withers) to length (withers to base of tail) are 1:1.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nPeruvian Hairless dogs are affectionate with family but wary of strangers.  They tend to be very protective of women and children in the family.\nThey are typically lively, alert and friendly with other dogs.\nThey are agile and fast, and many of them enjoy sight-hunting small rodents.\nThese dogs do not like to be alone, but when trained, can do well. They tend to know their allowed territories and respect it.\nThese dogs are intolerant of extreme temperatures, although they are quite comfortable wearing clothing and will even play in the snow if dressed warmly. \nThey generally require an owner that understands dog language and are not recommended for beginners.\nThey learn fast, and they are very smart, but get bored easily with repetitious games like \"fetch\".\n\n\n== Care ==\n\nThe lack of hair leads to a reputation for being clean, for being easy to wash with a sponge, and for a natural lack of fleas or other parasites. They also do not cause typical allergic reactions to dog-sensitive humans because they lack the normal dog dander.  Despite this, the dog needs care, but in another way. The skin should be washed from time to time to remove dirt and prevent clogging of pores. Baby cleaners are a good choice provided that they do not contain lanolin. Some dogs are prone to have acne or at least blackheads. The skin sometimes becomes too dry and can then be treated with moisturizing cream. Again, baby lotion without lanolin is a good product choice to soften and moisturize cleansed skin.  The dogs themselves seem to prefer olive, vegetable or coconut oil, possibly because of the perfumes and other chemicals found in commercial moisturizing creams.\nProtection against sunlight is recommended on lightly colored/white dogs. Sun-block or other methods are beneficial to prevent sunburn.  When out-breeding Peruvians typically select dark-coated dogs to ensure puppies with dark skin.\nProtection against cold is necessary when the dog is not able to move around at its own speed under adverse weather conditions. Sensitivity to cold may vary from dog to dog. Smaller dogs seem to be more sensitive to the cold than their larger counterparts.  Even so, the dogs are kept in Puno at 3,800 meters altitude, where the average temperature is 15 degrees Celsius, and are fairly common in Cusco at 3,400 meters.\nThe rims of the ears sometimes need special attention as they can become dry and cracked.\n\n\n== Genetics and health ==\n\nThe gene that causes hairlessness also results in the breed often having fewer teeth than other breeds, mostly lacking molars and premolars. All are born with full sets of puppy teeth, but these are not fully replaced by adult teeth as they naturally fall out, leaving them with varying levels of adult dentition. \nThe hairlessness trait is a dominant double lethal mutation, which means that homozygotic hairlessness does not exist. Homozygous embryos, those with two copies of the gene, do not develop in the womb. This results in an average birthrate of 2:1, hairless : coated.\nAccording to Hans R\u00e4ber \"Enzyklop\u00e4die der Rassehunde\" T.I 33% of the  population is born coated.\nWhile they are recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) for its Foundation Stock Service as Peruvian Inca Orchid dogs, they cannot be shown at AKC shows, they are also registerable with FCI, UKC, NKC, APRI, ACR. Some breeders think that interbreeding with coated (Peruvian) dogs is required to maintain functional teeth and nervous system health in subsequent generations. They say that breeding of hairless with hairless (and common but unacknowledged culling of hairy pups from litters to maintain a \"pure\" image) leads to short-lived dogs with serious health problems.\nHowever, other breeders (especially in Peru) think the opposite, and are doing well (for centuries already), too.  Peruvian non-breeder families typically out-breed with coated dogs every other or every third generation to keep them healthy.\nLike all breeds there are some health problems.  These include IBD, seizures, stroke, and skin lesions.\nThey are very sensitive to toxins and care should be taken in use of insecticides.  Insecticides are absorbed through the skin, and body fat keeps these toxins from entering the liver too quickly.  Since these dogs have very low body fat, toxins are absorbed too quickly and cause severe damage to the nervous system and GI tract.\n\n\n== History ==\nThis is an ancient breed. Although it is often perceived to be an Incan dog because it is known to have been kept during the Inca Empire (the Spaniards classified them as one of the 6 different breeds of dogs in the Inca Empire),\nthey were also kept as pets in pre-Inca cultures from the Peruvian coastal zone. Ceramic hairless dogs from the Chim\u00fa, Moche, and Vicus culture are well known.  Depictions of Peruvian hairless dogs appear around 750 A.D. on Moche ceramic vessels and continue in later Andean ceramic traditions.\nThe main area of the Inca Empire (the mountains) is too cold for the natural existence of hairless dogs.  While they were commonly eaten in ancient times in the northern coastal areas of Peru the Inca prohibited the consumption of dogs when they conquered that region.\nThe Spanish conquest of Peru nearly caused the extinction of the breed. The dogs survived in rural areas where the people believed that they held a mystical value, and because of their reputation to treat arthritis.  \nIn recent years, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) accepted the breed and adopted an official breed standard. Before that time, in the United States, some enthusiasts created another type of Peruvian hairless dog, the Peruvian Inca Orchid.  The Peruvian Inca Orchid is recognized by the AKC, and all recognized dogs are descendants of 13 dogs brought from Peru in the early 20th century. The club UKC also recognized the breed in recent years.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChiribaya Dog, also known as Peruvian shepherd dog.\nMexican Hairless Dog\nSphynx or Canadian Hairless Cat\nRare breed (dog)\nChinese Crested Dog\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 368, "name": "Phal\u00e8ne", "country": "Belgium, Spain", "type": "", "picture": "dog368", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 369, "name": "Pharaoh Hound", "country": "Malta", "type": "Sighthound and Pariah", "picture": "dog369", "description": "The Pharaoh Hound is a Maltese breed of dog and the national dog of Malta. In Maltese it is called Kelb tal-Fenek, which means \"rabbit dog\". It is traditionally used for hunting rabbit in the Maltese Islands.Based on DNA analysis, the breed have been recreated in more recent times from combinations of other breeds. However, a popular myth holds that the breed is descended from the Tesem, one of the ancient Egyptian hunting dogs. Some believe that there are similarities between the breed and images of dogs found on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs. This myth proposes that the Pharaoh Hound was brought by the Phoenicians to Malta, where it has existed for over 2,000 years.The breed has variously been classified as a member of the sighthound group.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nAt first glance, the Pharaoh Hound appears both graceful and elegant as well as powerful and athletic. Its build is one of strength without bulkiness or excessive musculature.  Its head is elegant without being fine or extreme.  The skull resembles a blunt wedge, and is long and chiseled with only a slight stop and a snout of good length.  Its eyes are oval with a keen, alert, and intelligent expression. Their eyes are commonly amber-colored.  It has a long, lean, and muscular neck that is slightly arched. It has a deep chest that extends down to the elbows and a moderate tuck up. Its shoulders are long and well laid back. Its front legs are long and straight. The back legs are moderately angled, parallel to each other, and must be balanced with the forelegs. It has a long, fine, straight tail that reaches down to a bit below the point of the hocks, and has a whip-like shape.  The tail is carried down when relaxed.  When the dog is in motion or is excited, the tail is carried up; either level with, or loosely curled above, the back. Its dewclaws may be removed. The Pharaoh Hound's ears are very large and point upward when alert. They usually come in tan or chestnut colors. A white tail-tip is admired. Most commonly seen is any solid white spot on their neck, back, or shoulders. Mainly seen on the back or sides of the dog.Pharaoh Hounds tend to weigh up to 45-55 pounds on average. Weight depends on the sex of the dog, or its eating habits. Male Pharaoh Hounds are normally considered larger than the females. Males usually are 23-25\", while females are 21-24\". Size and weight also relate to the amount of exercise it receives.The coat is fine and short with no feathering. The texture varies from silky to somewhat hard and it must never be so profuse as to stand away from the dog's skin. The coat can also be glossy and short in most cases.  The only colour accepted by most kennel clubs is red; though the shades of red colour varies, and accepted shades range from a tan to a deep chestnut and all shades in between. White markings on the chest, toes, tail-tip, centre of forehead, and the bridge of the muzzle are accepted, but not required. Pharaoh's eyes are always amber, and should complement the coat colour. They are born with blue eyes, which change to a light gold or yellow colour during early puppyhood and then begin to darken well into adulthood.  The nose, whiskers, nails, paw-pads, and eye-rims should also be the same colour as the coat. Pharaohs also have a unique trait of \"blushing\" when excited or happy, with their ears and nose becoming bright pink.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1647 Giovanni Francesco Abela, in his Della Descrittione di Malta isola nel Mare Siciliano: con le sue antichit\u00e0, ed altre notizie, wrote \"... we have the dogs called Cernechi, much valued for rabbit-hunting, which are often in demand as far away as France, mainly for [use in] steep and stony mountain terrain\". Authors such as Cecil Camilleri have taken this to refer to the Kelb tal-Fenek. The modern Cirneco is a Sicilian breed,  very similar in structure and appearance, but somewhat smaller (43\u201351 cm (17\u201320 in)) than the Kelb tal-Fenek.\nIn Britain, the first two specimens of the breed were brought from Malta in the 1920s, but no litter was bred. Again, some dogs were imported to the UK in the early 1960s, and the first litter was born in 1963. The breed standard was recognised by The Kennel Club in 1974. The breed was called the Pharaoh Hound although this name was already used by the FCI as an alternative name for the Ibizan Hound at that time. When the FCI abolished this name in 1977 and decided to call the Ibizan Hound exclusively by its original Spanish name Podenco Ibicenco, the term Pharaoh Hound was transferred to the Kelb tal-Fenek, whose breed standard had been recognised by the FCI at the same time.There are a number of breeds similar to the Pharaoh Hound in the Mediterranean area, including the Cirneco in Sicily. Others include the Podenco Ibicenco, the Podenco Canario and the Podengo Portugu\u00eas. Each breed is slightly different with physical characteristics that match the terrain the dogs hunt on. It is not clear whether those breeds have descended from the same ancestral lines, or whether their similarities have developed due to similar environmental conditions.\n\n\n== Health ==\nPharaoh hounds, being somewhat uncommon outside of the Maltese Islands of Malta and Gozo, and because they are not profitable for commercial breeding, have not been subjected to as much irresponsible breeding as some more popular breeds. Breeders try hard to prevent hereditary diseases from entering the gene pool and according to the American breed club, Pharaohs are virtually free from genetic diseases. Reputable breeders continue to test their breeding stock for genetic conditions such as hip dysplasia, luxating patellas, and myriad eye conditions just to ensure that these disorders do not become a problem. Reputable breeders should be able to show documentation of health screening performed on their breeding dogs. Note that Pharaohs, like most sighthounds, are sensitive to barbiturate anaesthetics. Their ears are thin and prone to frostbite when in cold climates.\nLife expectancy is about 12 to 14 years.\n\n\n== Hunting ==\n\nThe Kelb tal-Fenek is usually taken out to hunt at night when there are fewer distractions. Generally, the hunters will take their dogs into the countryside and release pairs of a male and a female dog in each compass direction. The dogs will then search out their prey using scent. When a rabbit is found the hounds will give chase, the small and more agile female in the lead with the male keeping the rabbit from darting too far to the sides. At this point the dogs giving chase will emit a high pitched bark, attracting the other dogs and the hunters, all of whom will come running. By the time the hunters and other dogs arrive the rabbit will almost always have taken to the ground. The hunters will then gather and leash all but one dog, then place nets over all of the likely escape holes of the rabbit. Finally the hunter will take a ferret (with a small bell attached) from a round wicker basket, and places it into the last entrance to the rabbit's burrow. The Kelb tal-Fenek can hear the little bell up to 3 meters down under the rocky terrain. When the ferret flushes the rabbit out a hole, one free dog swoops down upon it. This style of hunting is mentioned by Strabo about hunting in the Balearic Islands under Roman rule, and the Maltese word for ferret\u2014\"nemes\"\u2014may have its roots in the Greek word 'nemesis'.The Kelb Tal-Fenek has a very unusual hunting style especially on its own. When its prey either rabbit or vermin is in a mound, the Kelb tal-Fenek will bounce in the air and land on all 4 legs in an attempt to have its prey come out in the open or move.\n\n\n== Competitions and shows ==\nThe Pharaoh Hound International Champion XO EZ owned by Lori Evans, Joseph Buchanan and Ronald and Desiree Frank, placed 4th in the Hound Group at Crufts 2007.\nA Pharaoh Hound, GCH Northgate's As You Like It (\"Qing\"), owned by Ms. J. Hall from Sweden, was Hound Group Winner at Crufts, 2009 and 2010 and was the 2008 World Dog Show Reserve BIS & Group V Winner in addition to the 2009 World Dog Show BIS & Group V Winner. Qing was later shown in the United States and went on to become the top winning Pharaoh Hound in the history of the breed.  His American Kennel Club ranking as of December 2011 included placing as the number 8 dog all breeds, the number 2 hound, and the number 1 Pharaoh Hound.\n\n\n== Miscellaneous ==\nThe Kelb tal-Fenek is not the only breed of dog specific to the tiny islands of Malta. There is also the Kelb tal-But (\"pocket dog\", a toy breed), Kelb tal-Ka\u010b\u010ba (\"hunting dog\", a breed used for bird hunting), and lastly a type of Mastiff which is now extinct (Kelb tal-\u0120lied, sometimes called the Maltese Bulldog or Maltese Mastiff). It is number 141 out of 154 breeds by dogs registered in 2005 by the AKC.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPharaoh Hound at Curlie"}, {"id": 370, "name": "Phu Quoc Ridgeback", "country": "Vietnam", "type": "", "picture": "dog370", "description": "The Phu Quoc Ridgeback is a breed of dog from Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c Island in Vietnam's southern Ki\u00ean Giang Province. The Phu Quoc Ridgeback is one of only three breeds that has a ridge of hair that runs along its back in the opposite direction from the rest of the coat (the others are Rhodesian Ridgeback and Thai Ridgeback). The Phu Quoc is the smallest of the three ridgeback breeds.\nThe Phu Quoc dog was included in the Larousse Dictionary and is steadily gaining notice in the Western world. In Vietnam these dogs are still considered rare and there were only 700 purebred dogs registered and recognised by the Vietnam Kennel Club. This means due to the scarcity of true examples they are not able to enter many international dog shows as they are simply considered too rare to be able to judge the breed standard.\nA Phu Quoc Ridgeback won the 2013 Hanoi dog show.\n\n\n== Breed history ==\nNative to Vietnam, the Phu Quoc Ridgeback's history has not been well documented. Enthusiasts and few experts believe that all ridgeback breeds (including the Phu Quoc, Rhodesian, and Thai) originated in either Asia or Africa, due to their distinct ridge markings along the spine, though this has never been confirmed scientifically.\nIt is also believed that, like the Thai ridgeback, the Phu Quoc has been used as a carting, escort, hunting, and guard dog throughout its history due to its impressive appearance and muscular physique.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nAccording to elders on Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c Island, the dog was traditionally four main colours: spotted, black, yellow, and striped; however now the colours have become more varied. The rarest and most highly prized colours are pure black and yellow, with black eyes, black toes and a black spotted tongue. A mature dog is about 20\u201325 kg, with a small head, long neck, quite a long snout, thin yet long ears and dark speckles on the tongue. The body of tapering belly, straight legs and webbed feet allow Phu Quoc dogs to swim and run exceedingly well. They are also very good at climbing and can climb trees.\n\nAn important sign to recognize a true Phu Quoc dog is the sword shaped ridge on its back, together with short, thin hair. When facing competitors or running after prey, the hair on their back becomes erect, creating a ridge making the dog look brave and strong. Now, it is difficult to find purebred Phu Quoc dogs, as they have mixed with other breeds.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Phu Quoc Ridgeback is best known for its ability to jump higher and run and swim faster than most other breeds. These dogs love to hunt and chase, and are also known for protecting their home. This breed is extremely loyal, loving, and naturally obedient, thriving on dependable human relationships. The Phu Quoc is an intelligent and curious breed that loves to learn.\n\n\n== Training ==\nDue to its need for strong human relationships and its obedient nature, the Phu Quoc Ridgeback responds well to basic training and commands. These dogs enjoy learning and pleasing their owners, and can be taught to perform most any task its trainer is willing to take the time to teach it.\nEstablishing mutual respect and trust are keys to training the Phu Quoc Ridgeback.\nThe breed is highly intelligent, and may do tricks without command.\n\n\n== Purchasing ==\nThe Phu Quoc Ridgeback remains very rare outside of Vietnam and can prove difficult to obtain even in Vietnam. The only known dogs in Europe successfully had a litter of four healthy puppies In September 2015 by a UK based breeder. At least one of the puppies has since been exported to the United States. There are a handful in the US and Canada. Individuals seeking to purchase this breed will often encounter such challenges as the inability to locate a breeder, high prices, dogs that have been cross-bred with other breeds and long waiting lists. More and more visitors are beginning to come to Phu Quoc in search of the dogs, giving rise to a breeding camp on the island which sells dogs. Exporting the dogs to countries outside Vietnam is straightforward in terms of Vietnamese documentation.  The difficulties lie in the destination country whereby Australia and other rabies free countries are difficult and non-rabies free countries such as North America are relatively easy to ship dogs to.\n\n\n== Common health concerns ==\nWhile the Phu Quoc Ridgeback is generally known as a healthy and hearty breed, they can occasionally suffer from a few health problems, including: hip dysplasia, various joint problems such as arthritis, patellar luxation - dislocation of the knee, and bloat. They can live up to 16 years old. This is in spite of coming from a country where veterinary care is rare and usually of a very basic standard.\nThe main issue with the breed is ensuring that they receive correct (and non-counterfeit) vaccinations when going to the mainland from Phu Quoc so they do not catch parvovirus.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Phu Quoc Ridgeback was selected as the mascot for the 2018 annual Nguyen Hue Flower Street in Ho Chi Minh City, symbolizing the lunar Year of the Dog as per the Vietnamese zodiac.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAnusorn Supmannue (transl. by P.

It is related to the Blue Picardy Spaniel, and still has many similarities, but the Picardy Spaniel is the older of the two breeds. It is thought to be one of the two oldest continental spaniel breeds and was favoured by the French nobility, remaining popular for hunting after the French Revolution due to its weather resistant coat that enabled it to hunt in a variety of conditions and terrain. However its popularity waned following the influx of English hunting breeds in the early 20th century. Slightly smaller than an English Setter but larger than most of its spaniel cousins, it has no major health issues although as with many breeds with pendulous ears, it can be prone to ear infections.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe French Spaniel and the Picardy Spaniel are considered to be the two oldest continental breeds of spaniel. Both breeds are speculated to have stemmed from the Chien d' Oysel described in the writings of Gaston Phoebus. Hunting during this period in France was one of the favourite sports of the nobility and the French type of Spaniel became the favourite hunting dog of the French Royalty. The breed can be seen in paintings dating from this period by artists Alexandre-Fran\u00e7ois Desportes and Jean-Baptiste Oudry. They were also the first breed of dog to be admitted into salons.The breed became more popular still following the French Revolution and the aftermath in which hunting was no longer restricted to the nobility. Although spread throughout France, a large concentration was located in the north west where the weather resistant coat of the breed made it ideal for the wooded and swampy conditions. During the early 19th century, British hunters crossed the channel to hunt in the grounds of north west France. The British brought their own hunting dogs, and this resulted in a change of preference as French hunters switched to English breeds and caused a major blow to the existence of the Picardy Spaniel. In addition the infusion of blood from the English Setter into the local spaniel population created the Blue Picardy Spaniel.\n\n\n=== Recognition ===\nThe Epagneul Picard Club was formed in 1921 and was merged with the Club of Blue Picardy Spaniel on 28 July 1937. A further merger took place on 21 May 1980 when these clubs merged with the Pont-Audemer Club to form the Club des Epagneuls Picards, Bleus de Picardie & Pont Audemer.The Picardy Spaniel is recognised by a variety of Kennel Clubs and associations including the North American Kennel Club, American Rare Breed Association, United Kennel Club,  and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale. All four associations use the standard as set by the FCI. It is also recognised by the Continental Kennel Club, but unlike the closely related Blue Picardy Spaniel, it is not recognised by the Canadian Kennel Club.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nTypical examples of the breed measure between 22\u201324 inches (56\u201361 cm) at the withers, with the average weight between 20\u201325 kilograms (44\u201355 lb). The breed is similar in size to the English Setter, although is slightly smaller. Of the Spaniel type breeds, only the Large M\u00fcnsterl\u00e4nder and Drentse Patrijshond are recognised as possibly growing to larger sizes, with the Drentse measuring 21.5\u201325.5 in (55\u201365 cm), and the M\u00fcnsterl\u00e4nder slightly smaller with a narrower range at 23\u201325 in (58\u201364 cm).The breed has a squarely built muscular body and  an oval shaped head with a long muzzle and long ears that hang fairly low. Its coat can vary in colours from chocolate, chestnut brown and white with sandy coloured markings on the head and white or grey spots on the legs. Its hair is abundant with a slight wave, enabling it to work in dense cover and even in water.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Picardy Spaniel is a docile breed of dog and is fond of playing with children and bonds well with their master. It is described as having a gentle sociable nature, possessing a good character and being relatively easy to train. In France, the breed is used for hunting in wooded areas for Pheasants, and in swamps for Snipes. However it can also be used for hunting ducks, hares and rabbits. The breed excels at hunting in marshes and will not hesitate to jump into water. It can also adequately serve as a retriever should it be required.

However being a hunting spaniel, the breed is prone to ear infections. These infections are common among dogs with pendulous ears, including Basset Hounds and other breeds of spaniel.

He added Beagle, Fell Terrier, and Bull Terrier, creating an established and defined individual type. Initially known as the Huddlesford Rat Pack, the breed is now named after him.\nIn the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, Plummer worked as a somewhat reluctant teacher of several schools throughout south Yorkshire and the Midlands. A self-confessed rustic eccentric, his passion was hunting rats with what was then his motley pack of Russell-type terriers. He became a leading author of books on hunting with lurchers and terriers. Well-versed in breeding, he strove to produce a unique strain of terrier using the aforementioned bloodlines with Jack Russell terriers from Sealy Cottage lines as his foundation. These terriers were worked hard and as the breed developed so too did Plummer\u2019s reputation as a breeder of hardy terriers that bred true to type.\nThe dogs of this time consisted of Vampire, who died in 1980 aged nine, this Plummer terrier was a veteran of the weekly rat hunts at the local battery hen farm. His brother Warlock, sister Beltane (who Brian regarded as the \"matron\" of his terrier team and indeed the prototype of the breed) and probably most famous Omega, bred by her sire Vampire to his own daughter Janey. Plummer dedicated a whole book to the hunting abilities of Omega.\nThe Beagle introduced to Plummer\u2019s lines in the 1960s was out of Catherine Sutton\u2019s Rossut show-bred strain that originated from USA imports, brought to the UK to tidy up British exhibits. It was owned by Philip Ainsley, a fellow teacher friend of Brian's.\nFurther outcrosses were introduced along the way. The addition of Fell terrier blood, Jaeger from Nigel Hinchcliffe's lines and Flint from Brian Nuttall's lines, both noted working lines and most likely descending from Cyril Breay and Frank Buck's stock, infused refinement of shape and to a certain extent contributed to fixing type, like that seen in Pagan, a black and tan terrier, acknowledged as one of the early pillars of the breed.\nFurther additions included a Jack Russell terrier known as Errol Forsyth's Pip, Alan Thomas's Hamish, and Laddie from the Chiddingfold and Leconfield foxhound kennels. Performance as an earth dog was and is an essential prerequisite of most, if not all terrier breeds and Plummers are no exception to this rule. These three dogs were known to be full-on earth workers.\nIn the early 1980s during one of the many TV documentaries (Rat hunting man and Lone furrow) about Plummer and his terriers he said that one day he would like his terriers to be known as Plummer terriers and recognised by the Kennel Club.\nIn 1985, he suffered a near-fatal heart attack which resulted in the dispersal of his substantial pack of terriers to friends. He eventually moved to a remote croft in Caithness, Scotland, and began to write full-time. By the early 1990s most of the pack's important gene pool was found and regrouped, albeit on a smaller scale. Work continued and other lines were sort widening the gene pool enough to be able to limit inbreeding.\nAt this point, two distinct types began to develop, the smaller more snipey nosed form and the more bully stronger headed type. Plummer opted for the latter, and by the late 1990s decided that the breed needed a wider gene pool in order to reach its maximum potential. Bull Terrier blood of known ancestry was sought and outcrossed into the breed.\nPlummer had cancer and died in September 2002. His work was carried on by others and the breed standard remains intact.\nAs a working terrier, the Plummer is a versatile dog, which has many uses. They are keen retrievers, most generally take to water freely, quite intelligent, have excellent noses, are biddable and have many uses in the field. They\u2019re often found ferreting, some are found in the beating line on local shoots, occasionally they are used to ground but undoubtedly they are most commonly used in a pack hunting rats.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Plummer terrier is a striking dog to look at, its fiery red coat should conform to two distinct patterns collared (a white band around the neck) and caped (only showing white on the throat). They should be heavily coloured and preferably be no more than 14\u201d at the shoulder. Terriers that do not possess collared or caped markings are labelled shattered, they are perfectly fine as workers, companions but are not classed as good examples of the breed.  The same can be said for tricolours, dogs which carry black in their colouring.The ears fold over like most terriers, and the nose and eye are typically black, and the jaw has a good scissors bite.\n\n\n=== Breed standard ===\nPlummer defined a breed standard in 2000.\n\nGeneral Character: a Plummer Terrier should be strong, hardy, active and adaptable, with terrier characteristics and as much substance as possible. They should be equally at home in the house as in the kennel, be highly intelligent, courageous and tenacious. Affectionate, loyal and trustworthy with family and friends.  Yet should present a bright, alert appearance without displaying any excessive aggression or nervousness.\nHead: medium-sized, full of quality with strong bones and powerful cheek and jaw muscles. Slight bull terrier characteristics are encouraged as is a well defined stop.\nEars: dropped, rounded, and neatly pinned to head. Prick or rose ears are not encouraged.\nEyes: dark, prominent and oval, set widely apart.\nMuzzle: strong, lips close with no excessive looseness. Teeth strong and even with full scissor bite.\nNeck: strong, elegant, especially in the case of bitches, and well carried.\nShoulders and forelegs: strong, well laid back and developed without excessive muscle tone. Forelegs should be set square and straight and not tied in. Feet should be well shaped and dense. No resemblance of bend in front.\nBack, hindquarters and hind legs: back and loins, muscular, strong and well coupled, with well defined muscle development. Hindquarters should be lengthy and strong, with a well set on tail. Hind legs - second thigh should be strong and muscular. Hocks clean and flat, turning neither inwards nor outwards. The hind leg must not be too bent. Feet: well shaped and dense.\nBody: square in appearance when viewed from side i.e. distance of shoulder to ground. Depth through the heart should be easily spanned by two hands placed just behind the shoulders.\nTail: carried high. Preferably docked and balanced to the size of the dog. Curled tails not encouraged.\nCoat: short, close and without guard hairs, yet with the ability to withstand weather. Loose / broken coats not acceptable.\nColour and markings: a bright fiery red with white. Full cape markings from head to tail, or a broad collar of white between head and shoulders are encouraged. Underside of the belly and chest, front and rear legs should be white although flecking is acceptable. Head either solid colour, or with stripe or badger marked. Tricolour Plummer terriers are still produced in small numbers today and whilst registerable with club registrars they are generally not encouraged.\nHeight: maximum height to the shoulder, dog or bitch 14 inches.\nMovement: should be light, energetic, free, true and forcible and cover the ground. Hocks should be flexed under the body with straight powerful leverage.\nFaults: undershot or overshot mouths. Unsoundness, coarseness or displaying a hereditary fault.\n\n\n== Future ==\nGenerally a game working dog, the Plummer Terrier is not a Kennel Club breed, and most owners today who work their dogs would prefer that this dog was not part of the Kennel Club yet for a myriad of reasons.\nWhile the Plummer Terrier generally breeds true in appearance, the standard is a working terrier standard. The most common serious health fault in this breed is cleft palate, followed by foul mouth, patella luxation and cryptorchidism.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPlummer Terrier Club of Great Britain"}, {"id": 373, "name": "Plott Hound", "country": "United States", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog373", "description": "The Plott Hound is a large scent hound, originally bred for hunting bears. The Plott Hound is not a well known breed of dog, even though it is the state dog of North Carolina. In 1989, the North Carolina General Assembly designated the Plott Hound as the official State Dog.The Plott Hound was first registered with the United Kennel Club in 1946. Plotts were recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2006 and were exhibited at Westminster Show in 2008.Chosen for their tracking and hunting abilities, two Plott Hound puppies have been trained as K9 deputies for the Guilford County Sherriff's Department.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Plott Hound is generally athletic, muscular, and agile in appearance, with a medium build. Unlike some other hounds, the Plott's skin is not baggy. The Plott is a strongly built yet moderate hound, with a distinct brindle-colored coat. Its appearance suggests the capacity for speed, stamina and endurance. The Plott may have an identification mark on it that is used to identify the dog when hunting. Such a mark is not penalized in conformation shows.\n\n\n=== Coat and color ===\nThe Plott Hound's hair should be fine to medium in texture, short or medium in length, and have a smooth and glossy appearance.

Brindled is defined as \"Finely streaked or striped effect or pattern of black or tan hairs with hairs of a lighter or darker background color. Shades of colors accepted: yellow brindle, red brindle, tan brindle, brown brindle, black brindle, grey brindle, and maltese (slate grey, blue brindle).\" Acceptable colors are any of the above-mentioned brindles. Black with brindle trim in the alternative. The Association dictates that while some white on chest and/or feet is permissible, white anywhere else is a fault.\n\n\n=== Size ===\nA Plott Hound should measure approximately 20 to 25 in (55 to 71 cm) at the withers for males, 20 to 23 in (53 to 63 cm) for females. Males should weigh 50 to 60 lb (23 to 27 kg). Females should weigh 40 to 55 lb (18 to 25 kg).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOf the seven breeds of United Kennel Club (UKC) registered coonhounds, the Plott Hound is the only that does not trace its ancestry to the foxhound.\nThe Plott Balsams, a mountain range in North Carolina, are named for the Plott family, whose ancestor, (Johannes) George Plott (c. 1733-1815), immigrated to North Carolina in the late 18th century from Germany.  The Plott Hound breed of hunting dog, is also named for the Plotts.The ancestors of today's Plott Hounds were used for boar hunting in Germany. Originally from Germany, in 1750 Johannes \"George\" Plott emigrated to the English colony of North Carolina.  He brought a few wild boar hounds (five Hanoverian Hounds, used for bear and boar hunting) with him. These dogs had been bred for generations for their stamina and gameness. George and his wife Margaret with their family settled in the mountains of western North Carolina. Though there is no evidence that Plott ever came to western North Carolina, his son Henry settled there around 1801 to 1810 (as census discloses) and was responsible for the Plott Hound's later development.\nPlott supposedly kept his strain entirely pure, making no outcrosses. In 1780, the Plott pack passed into the hands of Henry Plott.Shortly after, a hunter living in Rabun Gap, Georgia, who had been breeding his own outstanding strain of \"leopard spotted dogs\" heard of the fame of the Plott Hounds and came to North Carolina to see for himself. He was so impressed that he borrowed one of Montraville Plott's top stud dogs for a year to breed to his own bitches. This single cross is the only known instance of new blood being introduced into the Plott Hound since it first came to this country. Eventually Mont decided not to continue this breeding practice and gave all the leopard dogs away, returning to his original breeding practices.\nOther crosses possibly took place around the year 1900. G.P. Ferguson, a neighbor of the Plott family in North Carolina in those days, was a major influence on the Plott breed. He made a careful study of the Blevins hounds and the Cable hounds of that era. The extent to which he used these bloodlines in his Plott breeding program is not known.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nStrike and Stay: The Story of the Plott Hound, Bob Plott, The History Press, 2007, ASIN: B0061S3YLW, pp. 25\u2013 30\n\n\n== External links ==\nPlott Hound at Curlie"}, {"id": 374, "name": "Podenco Canario", "country": "Spain", "type": "Sighthound and Pariah", "picture": "dog374", "description": "Podenco Canario (In English: Canary Islands Hound, Canarian Warren Hound) is a breed of dog originally from the Canary Islands. The Podenco Canario is still used in the Canary Islands today in packs as a hunting dog, primarily used for rabbit hunting. The word \"podenco\" is Spanish for \"hound\". \"Canario\" means \"Canarian\" or \"of the Canaries\".\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Canarian hound is a slender and lightly built but sturdy dog, of medium size, with height at the withers approximately 55 to 64 cm (21.7 to 25.2 ins) for males, females are slightly smaller. Sizes vary with the terrain on which the dog hunts. The short, dense coat should be some shade of red, white, or a combination of red and white, depending on the island and, in some cases, the specific area on some of the islands. There should be no other colour on the coat, or indeed anywhere on the body, as even the dog's nose, nails and skin should be a shade of red, and they are even known to \"blush\" when excited. The neck is long, the head is longer than it is wide, and the large ears are carried fully up. The long tail is usually seen low set but can be raised. The tail is not carried too high when moving. The dog should move in an extended and agile trot. Faults, which indicate that a particular dog should not be bred, include aspects of appearance as well as structural faults that would prevent the dog's ability to move and hunt, such as cow hocks, and crossing of the fore and hind legs at a trot.It is a slightly elongated and very muscular dog with a brown color (chocolate) or also light brown or yellow, can go or not accompanied by white markings, usually have little fur. Start hunting from an early age, with cases of animals less than three months showing strong hunting instinct. When its discover and/or pursuing a prey, they emit a characteristic short and repetitive barking, local hunters known as \"sing a rabbit\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Podenco Canario is found on all of the Canary Islands and has long been thought to descend from a very ancient type brought to the islands in antiquity, and isolated there, presumed to be an example of the very oldest breeds. It was thought to have originated in Egypt and North Africa, and brought to the Canaries by the very earliest human settlers on the islands. Linguistic and genetic analyses of the descendants of the earliest known human inhabitants of the Canary Islands seem to indicate  a common origin with the Berbers of northern Africa, who may have brought the dogs there as a food source.\nHowever, recent genetics studies have concluded that the Podenco is a type of dog more closely related to, and no more primitive than, the rest of the European hunting breeds.\n\n\n== Current use ==\nRabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are a serious pest in the islands, where they were introduced (first on La Palma) in the 16th century. Rabbit hunting with the Podenco Canario is a very popular sport, and a necessary pest control, yet does little to currently significantly alter the rabbit population. Hunting seasons are organised to maximize rabbit control while minimizing any damage hunters and their dogs may do to agricultural areas Used as a throw away tool and not seen as pets these poor hounds are often starved and mistreated often abandoned as soon as they can no longer hunt. Many end up in council pounds where they are kept in poor condition and then ultimately euthanised.\nThe Podenco Canario is recognised by La Real Sociedad Canina de Espa\u00f1a (R.S.C.E., the Spanish Kennel Club) as an indigenous breed and is recognised internationally  by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale as breed number 329 in Group 5 Spitz and primitive types, Section 7 : Primitive type - Hunting Dogs, Spain. In North America the breed is listed with the United Kennel Club as a hunting dog in the Sighthound & Pariah Group. The breed is also recognized by a number of minor registries, hunting clubs, and internet-based dog registry businesses. Exported from its homeland, it is promoted as a rare breed for those seeking a unique pet.\n\n\n== Health and temperament ==\nA very rare genetic disorder of sexual development which has been observed in one dog of this breed is a testicular/ovotesticular disorder, which can result in dogs that are genetically female (XX) developing testes or ovotestes instead of ovaries. This disorder was formerly referred to as SRY-negative XX sex reversal, and is more commonly documented in American and English Cocker Spaniels.The breed standard states that the typical behaviour is \"nervy, agitated, and of an enthusiastic dynamism\".\n\n\n== Similar breeds ==\nBreeds also listed in Group 5/Section 7 include the\nIbizan Hound, Cirneco dell'Etna, Portuguese Podengo, Galgo Espa\u00f1ol, and the Thai Ridgeback.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSighthound & Pariah Group\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPodenco Canario at CurlieHound Sanctuary"}, {"id": 375, "name": "Pointer (dog breed)", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog375", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 376, "name": "Poitevin (dog)", "country": "France", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog376", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 377, "name": "Polish Greyhound", "country": "Poland", "type": "Sighthound and Pariah", "picture": "dog377", "description": "The Polish Greyhound (Polish: chart polski, pronounced [xart \u02c8p\u0254lsk\u02b2i]) is a Polish sighthound breed.

Originally, these dogs were used for hunting birds - Great bustards. The Polish Greyhound was the favorite dog of the Polish nobility. It is probably derived from Asian greyhounds, such as the Persian Greyhound (Saluki)  and Central Asian Greyhound (Tazy).\nAfter World War II, breeding of this breed disappeared. Hunting with greyhounds was forbidden, and greyhound dogs were liquidated. Their keeping and breeding has been covered with a special permit, this provision still applies. From the 70s of the twentieth century began to reproduce the breed. Contemporary Polish Greyhound breeding was started by Stanis\u0142aw Czerniakowski, who bought two females - Taiga and Struska and one dog - Elbrus in the vicinity of Rostov-on-Don. From the association of Taiga and Elbrus the first litter of Polish greyhounds was born.In 1989, the breed was entered in the register of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI).\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nPolish Greyhounds have short, smooth fur that comes in many colors. The coat is somewhat heavier than a Greyhound's. They have an undercoat that gets thicker in the winter. Polish Greyhounds have a long brush on the tail and have culottes at the rear of the thighs. The average Polish Greyhound weighs about 60 - 90  pounds, and ranges from 27\u201332 inches tall.\nThe Chart Polski has a smooth double coat, regardless of season, which is harsh to the touch while offering excellent insulation. The breed is a persistent hunter, with a long muscular neck, unlike the greyhound, and the head is carried high. Large almond eyes are set in a slant, and the points of the hip bones are wide apart. The hind legs move closer together when the dog is moving at a short trot: this is called \"lacing\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nEva Maria Kr\u00e4mer: Rasy ps\u00f3w.

The Polish Hound has a keen sense of smell. This heightened sense combined with the endurance needed to hunt in harsh environments led to its use in hunting, while its stature made it popular with Polish nobility.\n\n\n== History ==\nF.B. Laska (1907), described Polish hounds as descended from the Kostroma Hound (the Hound of Tatars). According to other historians, the Polish Hounds developed through  crossbreeding of Bloodhounds (the St Hubert Hound), imported to Poland in the Middle Ages, with local hounds. Jan Szytier (1819) wrote about the \"Polish Hound\" and the \"Polish Scent Hound\" in his \"Hunting Guide\" (Poradnik My\u015bliwych). World War II resulted in the decline of the Polish Hounds' population. The attempts to revive the breed led to the emergence of two types: light-boned (bred by Colonel J\u00f3zef Paw\u0142usiewicz) and heavier-boned (bred by Colonel Piotr Kartawik).

A medium-sized breed, Ogar Polski is often described as strong and sleek, with a powerful bone structure.  The coloration of these animals is often a combination of a brown underside and black on top running from the neck to the tail.  The Polish Hound's voice is often described as resonant and pure  which makes it an ideal hunting dog. The Polish Hound matures slowly.  Intelligent and easily trained, Polish Hounds are known to be calm, affectionate animals and great pets.  Friendly with other breeds and very loyal, these dogs are also very protective of their land.  It is unclear as to whether this breed makes a good guard dog.  Many argue that its territorial nature makes it defensive against intruders, while other state that its passive nature renders it harmless to new people.

Poland has always been a country covered by deep forests, full of big game where the scent hound was the precious auxiliary of the hunter.  Hunting with scent hounds was highly esteemed by Polish nobility as attested by 14th century chronicles. \nIn the 17th century, at least two different types of Polish scent hounds were already well distinguished.\nDetailed descriptions are found in 19th century hunting literature: in 1819 Jan Szytier (Poradnik Mysliwych) describes the Polish \"brach\" and the Polish scent hound; in 1821, in the magazine \"Sylwan\", W.Kozlowski gives a description and provides illustrations of both types, the Polish \"brach\" (heavier) and the Polish scent hound (lighter); the very detailed description of Ignacy Bogatynski (1823\u20131825, Nauka Lowiectwa) could be used as the first breed standard.\nAfter the first World War, the Polish scent hound was still used for hunting in Poland in the eastern regions, but especially in the mountains on particularly difficult terrains.  In the Podkarpacle region, the famous Polish cynologist, Jozef Pawuslewicz (1903\u20131979) hunted with Polish scent hounds and was engaged in the development of breeding this dog. He wrote the first Breed Standard and on account of his efforts the breed was officially registered by the Polish Cynological Association.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPolish Hound\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Polish Hunting Dog\".

The double coat can be of any color or pattern; white, gray, and brown are most common, with black, gray, or brown markings. It is common for colors to fade as the dogs reach adulthood. The undercoat is soft and dense, while the topcoat is rough and either straight or wavy, but not curly. The hair around the head makes the head appear to be larger than it actually is, and typically covers the eyes.\nMales are 45 \u2013 50 cm (18 - 20 inches) in height at the withers, while females are 42 \u2013 47 cm (17 - 19 inches). Males typically weigh between 40 - 50 lb, females, 30 - 40 lb. The body is just off square, it appears rectangular due to the abundance of coat on the chest and rear; the ratio of the height to the body length should be 9:10 (a 45 cm tall dog should have a body 50 cm long).  The tail is either very short or docked in the United States.  European countries have banned docking for the most part and many PONs now have tails of varying lengths.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nPolish Lowland Sheepdogs are stable and self-confident.  They have an excellent memory and can be well trained, but may dominate a weak-willed owner. PONs adapt well to various conditions, and are  popular as companion dogs for apartment dwellers in their native Poland. PONs require a moderate amount of exercise daily.\n\n\n=== Activities ===\n\nThe Polish Lowland Sheepdog can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, Rally obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. PONs that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nIn general, PONs are a very healthy breed. Animals should be checked for hip dysplasia and checked for eye abnormalities such as PRA (Progressive Retinal Atrophy) before being used for breeding. PONs require a low protein diet.  The life expectancy of a PON is approximately 12 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKnown in its present form in Poland from at least the thirteenth century, the PON is most likely descended from the Puli, Tibetan Terrier and the herding dogs.\nKazimierz Grabski, a Polish merchant, traded a shipment of grain for sheep in Scotland in 1515, and brought six PONs to move the sheep.  A Scottish shepherd was so impressed with the herding ability of the dogs that he traded a ram and two ewes for a dog and two female dogs.  These dogs were bred with the local Scottish dogs to produce the Scottish herding dogs, most obviously the Bearded Collie.\nAlmost driven to extinction in World War II, the PON was restored mainly through the work of Dr. Danuta Hryniewicz and her dog, Smok (\"Dragon\"), the ancestor of all PONs in the world today, who sired the first ten litters of PONs in the 1950s.\nIn fact, Dr. Hryniewicz considered Smok to be the epitome of the breed, with a perfect anatomical build and a wonderful temperament. Smok set the standard and type that was emulated by PON breeders for generations to come, and from which the first official standard for the PON was finally written, and accepted by the FCI, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale,  in 1959. He is considered to be the 'father' of the modern Polish Lowland Sheepdog. His moderate build lends itself to working effortlessly all day long, running with ease to herd the sheep. Pictures of Smok can be seen in the book, \"The Official Book of the Polish Lowland Sheepdog\".\nThe American Kennel Club recognized the Polish Lowland Sheepdog as a breed in the Herding Group in 2001.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPolish Lowland Sheepdog at Curlie"}, {"id": 381, "name": "Polish Tatra Sheepdog", "country": "Poland", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog381", "description": "The Polish Tatra Sheepdog is a breed of dog introduced into the Tatra Mountains of Southern Poland by Vlachian (Romanian) shepherds.\nTatras are primarily considered livestock guardian dogs.

They are not all that similar in temperament to their Mountain dog cousins the Kuvasz, Great Pyrenees or Maremma Sheepdog. They are less aloof than the other breeds, tending to be better tied into their breeding and not as domesticated or inbred as some of their cousins.\nIn the USA the Tatra sheepdog is considered a rare breed. It is not recognized by the AKC.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Polish Tatra Sheepdog, which sometimes goes by the Owczarek Podhalanski and the Polish Mountain Sheepdog, originated in Podhale, in the Tatra Mountain area of Poland, hence the breed's name.  The breed has lived in the Polish mountains for thousands of years, but no exact date for the start of the breed was ever recorded.  There is a similar mystery around what breeds were mixed to form the Polish Tatra Sheepdog.  While no one is certain, many dog breeders say that the Polish Tatra Sheepdog came from the Mastiff breed. The breed was very popular among mountain workers for several centuries, and up to today.  It was so popular because, as its name implies, it was a fantastic sheepdog.  This success at herding sheep was mainly due to their high intelligence.  When predators were around the sheep, the Polish Tatra Sheepdog would gather up the sheep and stand by them instead of trying to attack the predator, which would leave the sheep open for other attacks.  This demonstrates their intelligence.  Their white coat also made them easily distinguishable from a bear or wolves, which was very helpful for workers.  Also, owners could shave the dogs and use their coat to produce wool.  Mountain workers also used to hold their tails while they lead the workers through the mountains and rough terrain.  Herding sheep was not the only job the breed could perform.  They were often used as personal guards and frequently guarded factories and other private property.  On top of this, it was often the case that the breed was used by the police force. The breed faced some hard times, though.  After the World Wars the breed was on the brink of extinction.  The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, (FCI), would not allow this to happen, though, and by the 1960s they started breeding the sheepdog more and more. Centuries ago, as their reputation as excellent sheepdogs spread, the breed spread slowly across Europe, but in 1980, an American Foreign Service Officer enjoyed the breed so much that he had three of them shipped to America, and by 1981 the breed also spread to Canada.\n\n\n== The Breed Today ==\nEven though being bred more frequently, the Polish Tatra Sheepdog is a very rare breed.  There are about 7500 dogs of this breed in the world right now registered on http://www.owczarek-podhalanski.eu/.  The majority are still in Poland, with about 600 being there, but America is sporting around 300 Polish Tatra Sheepdogs.  In other European countries, such as France, the breed is growing in popularity, as in 2003 there were 150 births there.  The Netherlands now has a booming breeding business for Tatras.  About 150 of them are still used for herding.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe average height for males is 65 to 70 centimetres (26 to 28 in), while for females it is 60 to 65 centimetres (24 to 26 in). Their signature would be their massive pure white double coat.  The coat is wavy with a curly top.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Polish Tatra Sheepdog is generally a very healthy dog with very few health risks.  The average life expectancy for this breed is usually 10\u201312 years old.  As with most large breed dogs, the Polish Tatra Sheepdog can occasionally get hip dysplasia.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nA lot of today's Polish Tatra Sheepdog's behaviors and qualities can be traced back to its use of guarding.  They are territorial, loyal and protective of their owners, and are very good watchdogs for this reason.  They have a very loud bark and will bark at anything that is suspicious, as they are trying to protect their family.  Since they were trained to be cautious and not attack until completely necessary when predators were around sheep, The Polish Tatra Sheepdog will not bite a stranger or other animals unless continuously provoked, leading them to be considered very dog and animal friendly.  From thousands of years of guarding sheep, they are very intelligent, calm and independent.\n\n\n== Maintenance ==\nAfter thousands of years of running around sheep, the Polish Tatra Sheepdog has a good amount of energy and needs a decently large fenced yard to run around in.  It is not a good apartment dog because of its size and amount of energy.  They are not very active inside, but are very active outside.  This is why constant walks are recommended.  During late spring and early winter, the Polish Tatra Sheepdog sheds its undercoat profusely.  The Polish Tatra Sheepdog is very intelligent, independent and needs a person well-experienced in positive reinforcement operant conditioning to train.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 382, "name": "Pomeranian (dog)", "country": "Germany, Poland", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog382", "description": "The Pomeranian (often known as a Pom) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is named for the Pomerania region in north-west Poland and north-east Germany in Central Europe. Classed as a toy dog breed because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from the larger Spitz-type dogs, specifically the German Spitz. It has been determined by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale to be part of the German Spitz breed; and in many countries, they are known as the Zwergspitz (\"Dwarf-Spitz\").\nThe breed has been made popular by a number of royal owners since the 18th century. Queen Victoria owned a particularly small Pomeranian and consequently, the smaller variety became universally popular. During Queen Victoria's lifetime alone, the size of the breed had decreased by half. Overall, the Pomeranian is a sturdy, healthy dog. The most common health issues are luxating patella and tracheal collapse. More rarely, the breed can have Alopecia X, a skin condition colloquially known as \"black skin disease\". This is a genetic disease which causes the dog's skin to turn black and lose all or most of its hair. As of 2013, in terms of registration figures, since at least 1998, the breed has ranked among the top twenty most popular breeds in the US, and the current fashion for small dogs has increased their popularity worldwide.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nPomeranians are small dogs weighing 1.9\u20133.5 kilograms (4.2\u20137.7 lb) and standing 5.0\u201311 inches (13\u201328 cm) high at the withers. They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured coat with a highly plumed tail set high and flat. The top coat forms a ruff of fur on the neck, which Poms are well known for, and they also have a fringe of feathery hair on the hindquarters.The earliest examples of the breed were white or occasionally brown or black. Queen Victoria adopted a small red Pomeranian in 1888, which caused that color to become fashionable by the end of the 19th century. In modern times, the Pomeranian comes in the widest variety of colors of any dog breed, including white, black, brown, red, orange, cream, blue, sable, black and tan, brown and tan, spotted, brindle, and parti, plus combinations of those colors. The most common colors are orange, black, or cream/white.The merle Pomeranian is a recent color developed by breeders. It is a combination of a solid base color with lighter blue/grey patch which gives a mottled effect. The most common base colors for the effect are red/brown or black, although it can also appear with other colors. Combinations such as brindle merle or liver merle are not accepted in the breed standard. In addition, the eye, nose and paw pad are marshmallow color, changing parts of the eye to blue and the color on the nose and paw pads to become mottled pink and black.Pomeranians have a thick, double coat. While grooming is not difficult, breeders recommend that it be done daily to maintain the quality of the coat and because of its thickness and the constant shedding, with trimming every 1\u20132 months. The outer coat is long, straight, and harsh in texture while the undercoat is soft, thick and short. The coat knots and tangles easily, particularly when the undercoat is being shed, which happens twice a year.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nPomeranians are typically friendly, playful and lively; but they can be aggressive with other dogs to try to prove themselves. Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention, but they can become dominant if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys can be an effective tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe life expectancy of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years. A well-bred dog on a good diet with appropriate exercise will have few health problems; and, if kept trim and fit, a Pomeranian is a sturdy dog. The breed does have similar health issues to many dog breeds, although some issues such as hip dysplasia are uncommon because of the Pomeranian's lightweight build. Some health issues can develop as a result of lack of attention to grooming and teeth-, ear-, and eye-cleaning. With routine care, these problems can be avoided. They are prone to early tooth loss, and dry food is recommended. Poms are one of the breeds with the smallest average litter size, with various sources giving numbers of between 1.9 and 2.7 puppies per litter.\n\n\n=== Common problems ===\n\nMerle colored dogs may have mild to severe deafness, increased intraocular pressure, ametropia, microphthalmia, and colobomas. Merle dogs born from parents who are also both merles may additionally have abnormalities of the skeletal, cardiac and reproductive systems.Luxating patella is another health issue in the Pomeranian breed. It occurs when, through either malformation or trauma, the ridges forming the patellar groove in the knee are not prominent and are too shallow to allow the patella to properly sit securely. This can cause the patella to \"luxate\" (jump out of the groove) sideways which will cause the leg to lock up with the foot off the ground. While the muscles are contracted the patella cannot return to the correct position. The initial pain is caused by the knee cap sliding across the ridges of the femur. Once out of position, the dog does not feel any pain caused by the slipped disc.\nTracheal collapse is caused by a weakening of the tracheal rings in the windpipe. It occurs when the rings that normally hold the shape of the windpipe collapse, closing the airway. The symptoms of a collapse include a honking cough that can sound similar to a goose honk, an intolerance to exercise, fainting spells and a cough that is worsened by hot weather, exercise and excitement. The tendency for episodes of tracheal collapse typically increases in frequency and severity as the dog ages.\nIn Pomeranians, a condition often called \"black skin disease\" occurs which is a combination of alopecia (hair loss) and hyperpigmentation (a darkening of the skin). Other names for this condition include woolly coat, coat funk, pseudo-Cushing's disease, or severe hair loss syndrome. This condition affects male Pomeranians more than females, and may be inherited. Although most affected dogs show signs following puberty, it can occur at any age. Other conditions can mimic this condition including Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism, chronic skin infections, and reproductive hormone disorders.Another common disorder in male Pomeranians is cryptorchidism. This is when either one or both of the testicles do not descend into the scrotum. It is treated through surgical removal of the retained testicle.\n\n\n=== Exercise ===\nThe Pomeranian is a small but energetic breed of dog. Although Pomeranians benefit from frequent attention, they need relatively little exercise: it is recommended to take them on several daily walks and let them run around an enclosed space.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nThe forerunners of today's Pomeranian breed were large working dogs from the Arctic regions. These dogs are commonly known as the Wolfspitz or Spitz type, which is German for \"sharp point\" which was the term originally used by Count Eberhard zu Sayn in the 16th century as a reference to the features of the dog's nose and muzzle. The Pomeranian is considered to be descended from the German Spitz.The breed is thought to have acquired its name by association with the area known as Pomerania which is located in northern Poland and Germany along the Baltic Sea. Although not the origin of the breed, this area is credited with the breeding which led to the original Pomeranian type of dog. Proper documentation was lacking until the breed's introduction into the United Kingdom.An early modern recorded reference to the Pomeranian breed is from 2 November 1764, in a diary entry in James Boswell's Boswell on the Grand Tour: Germany and Switzerland. \"The Frenchman had a Pomeranian dog named Pomer whom he was mighty fond of.\" The offspring of a Pomeranian and a wolf bred by an animal merchant from London is discussed in Thomas Pennant's A Tour in Scotland from 1769.Two members of the British Royal Family influenced the evolution of the breed. In 1767, Queen Charlotte, Queen-consort of King George III of England, brought two Pomeranians to England.\n\nNamed Phoebe and Mercury, the dogs were depicted in paintings by Sir Thomas Gainsborough. These paintings depicted a dog larger than the modern breed, reportedly weighing as much as 30\u201350 lb (14\u201323 kg), but showing modern traits such as the heavy coat, ears and a tail curled over the back.Queen Victoria, Queen Charlotte's granddaughter, was also an enthusiast and established a large breeding kennel. One of her favoured dogs was a comparatively small red sable Pomeranian which she possibly named \"Windsor's Marco\" and was reported to weigh only 12 lb (5.4 kg). When she first exhibited Marco in 1891, it caused the smaller-type Pomeranian to become immediately popular and breeders began selecting only the smaller specimens for breeding. During her lifetime, the size of the Pomeranian breed was reported to have decreased by 50%. Queen Victoria worked to improve and promote the Pomeranian breed by importing smaller Pomeranians of different colors from various European countries to add to her breeding program. Royal owners during this period also included Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais, the wife of Napoleon I of France, and King George IV of England.\nThe first breed club was set up in England in 1891, and the first breed standard was written shortly afterwards. The first member of the breed was registered in America to the American Kennel Club in 1898, and it was recognized in 1900.In 1912, two Pomeranians were among only three dogs to survive the sinking of RMS Titanic. A Pomeranian called \"Lady\", owned by Miss Margaret Hays, escaped with her owner in lifeboat number seven, while Elizabeth Barrett Rothschild took her pet to safety with her in lifeboat number six.Glen Rose Flashaway won the Toy Group at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1926, the first Pomeranian to win a group at Westminster. It would take until 1988 for the first Pomeranian, \"Great Elms Prince Charming II\", to win the Best in Show prize from the Westminster Kennel Club.In the standard published in 1998, the Pomeranian is included in the German Spitz standard, along with the Keeshond, by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale. According to the standard \"Spitz breeds are captivating\" and have a \"unique characteristic, cheeky appearance.\"\n\n\n=== Popularity ===\n\nThe Pomeranian has been among the more popular dog breeds in the United States, featuring consistently in the top 20 of registered AKC dog breeds since at least 1998, when it was ranked #10; the breed was #17 in the 2011 rankings, dropping two spots from the previous year. In 2012 and 2013 it remained in the top twenty and was ranked at #19.It is not listed in the top 20 breeds in the UK in either 2007 or 2008. In Australia their popularity has declined since 1986, with a peak of 1,128 Pomeranians registered with the Australian National Kennel Council in 1987; only 577 were registered in 2008. However, this is an increase from 2004, when only 491 dogs were registered.It is more popular in American cities in 2008, ranking joint tenth (with American Bulldog) in Detroit and Orlando, ninth in Los Angeles, a joint seventh in Seattle (again, with the American Bulldog), but third in Honolulu, only bested by the Labrador Retriever and the German Shepherd.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCompanion dog\nLap dog\nTherapy dog\nBoo (dog)\nMissile (Ghost Trick)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPomeranian at Curlie"}, {"id": 383, "name": "Pont-Audemer Spaniel", "country": "France", "type": "", "picture": "dog383", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 384, "name": "Poodle", "country": "Germany, France", "type": "Companion Dog, Gun Dog", "picture": "dog384", "description": "Poodles are a group of formal dog breeds, the Standard Poodle, Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle. The origin of the breed is still discussed, with a prominent dispute over whether the poodle descends from Germany as a type of water dog, or from the French Barbet.Ranked second most intelligent dog breed just behind the Border Collie, the poodle is skillful in many dog sports and activities, including agility, obedience, tracking to herding, circus performers or assistance dogs. Poodles have taken top honors in many conformation shows, including \"Best in Show\" at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1991 and 2002, and at the World Dog Show in 2007 and 2010.\nToy Poodles won \"Best in Show\" at Crufts in 1966 and 1982. Standard Poodles achieved the award in 1955, 1985, 2002, and 2014. The 2002 winner came from Norway and was the first overseas exhibit to win the Crufts best in show award.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe European mainland had known the poodle long before it was brought to England. Drawings by German artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer established the popular image of the breed in the 15th and 16th centuries. It was the principal pet dog of the late 18th century in Spain, as shown by the paintings of the Spanish artist Francisco Goya. France had toy poodles as pampered favorites during the reign of Louis XVI at about the same period.The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, the international organization of which both France and Germany's main kennel clubs are members, claims the breed descends from the French Barbet. When the breed was officially recognized by the FCI, in order to avoid any possible dispute between two founding members, Germany recognized the Poodle as a dog originating from France. The progenitor of the breed might have also been crossed with the Hungarian Puli. The French name Caniche comes from the word cane (the female of the duck) since this type of breed was used as a water retriever mainly for duck hunting thanks to its swimming ability.The British Kennel Club states that the breed originates in Germany, as do the American Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel Club, stating: \"Despite the Poodle\u2019s association with France, the breed originated as a duck hunter in Germany...\" The Oxford English Dictionary and the American Heritage Dictionary both trace the etymology of Poodle to the German Pudel, which itself comes from Pudelhund. The word Pudel in turn comes from Low German pud(d)eln meaning \"[to] splash in water,\" cognate with the English word puddle.\nThe poodle has contributed to many other dog breeds, such as the Miniature Schnauzer, Standard Schnauzer, and dogs of the Bichon type in order to either save those breeds from extinction, reduce size, or by dog fanciers to improve their appearance.\n\n\n== Size variants ==\nThe poodle has been bred in at least three sizes, including Standard, Miniature, and Toy. According to the American Kennel Club, which recognized the breed in 1887, the Standard Poodle is the oldest of the three varieties, and was later bred down to the miniature and toy sizes. The British Kennel Club also recognizes three sizes, stating that the miniature and toy are scaled down versions of the standard. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) recognizes four sizes of one breed: standard, medium, miniature, and toy. Poodles exist in many coat colours. Despite the Standard Poodle's claim to greater age than the other varieties, some evidence shows the smaller types developed only a short time after the breed assumed the general type by which it is recognized today. \nThe smallest, or Toy variety, was developed in England in the 18th century. Hunting and working dogs were typically of the standard variety, though some reports suggest that smaller varieties such as the miniature may have been popular for truffle hunting, as their feet were less likely to damage the delicate fungi. Miniature and Toy varieties tend to be bred primarily for companionship. In the mid to late 19th century, the trade in dyeing and affixing their fur to unusual proportions began with the need to compliment the Victorian and Georgian sensibilities of these women, to the point that their status as a dog of the middle and upper classes was quite solid by the time of the founding of the Kennel Club in the 1870s as they were one of the first dog breeds registered.\n\n\n== Work and sport ==\nTraditionally the Standard Poodle, the largest of the breed, was a retriever or gun dog, used in particular for duck hunting and sometimes upland bird hunting.  The breed has been used for fowl hunting in US and Canada since the early 1990s, in and out of hunting tests.  The modern Standard retains many of the traits prized by their original owners: a keen working intelligence that makes the dog easy to command, webbed feet that make it an agile swimmer (all of the poodle's ancestors and descendants had or share the love of water) athletic stamina, and a moisture-resistant, curly coat that acts like a wool jumper in damp conditions. Towards the second half of the nineteenth century their use in hunting declined in favour of their use in circuses and status symbols of the wealthy, so that by the 20th century they were only found as companions or circus\ndogs. \nHowever, in the past 20 years, some breeders in the United States and Canada have been selecting for dogs with drive for birds in order to revive the breed for hunting, with some success. The  Canadian Kennel Club admitted the Standard Poodle for hunting trials in 1996 and the American Kennel Club in 1998, respectively.As of May 2017, the end results of 25 years of breeding to reawaken the hunting instinct have been a success. It has resulted in dogs that are very eager to please their masters. It has resulted in a gun dog with extreme intelligence, a relentless drive to catch its quarry, and strong swimming skills that requires special training: their aptitude is second only to the British Border Collie and thus the hunting Standard Poodle requires the gunman to be quite specific as to what he wants and how he wants it done. Unlike other spaniels and retrievers, Standard Poodles will attempt to solve a problem independently and need to be told specifically what is wanted when tracking and retrieving a bird. Because they are highly intelligent, harsh or violent training methods do not work with this dog breed in the field\u2014corrections must be timely and given with precision, and the trainer must have a firm but kind hand; an overbearing owner training his dog to hunt will find his Standard poodle terrified of his master and the entire experience, and refusing to budge an inch towards the water or into the brush.\nHunting poodles typically are dogs with lightning quick reflexes, sprinting hard on command after the downed bird and having a prodigious ability to remember where the bird fell and (though not as good as the English Pointer) a decent nose to sniff and track a bird hiding in tall grass Recently,  Miniature Poodles have also begun to be added to the list of hunters in the field: in January 2002, the Canadian Kennel Club opened their Working Certificate program to poodles of all sizes and later in 2014 the American Kennel club opened their Hunt Test program to miniature poodles; in 2017 both the Standard and Miniature were declared eligible for American Kennel Club Spaniel Tests, a program  designed for testing dogs with flushing capabilities. Typically, a Miniature Poodle will be the smallest dog of all in the field as it weighs less than 25 lbs or about 10 kg: this is even less than a Boykin Spaniel, the former smallest dog, which weighs closer to 35 lbs, or 16 kg.  However, hunters in the USA and Canada have found them very useful for woodcock, chukar, mallards, and smaller ducks like the green-winged teal  and bufflehead: their tiny size is an asset in getting at corners and brush that comparatively more massive retrievers cannot reach or where bramble is too thick for cocker spaniels to access.Poodles have been used as working dogs in the military since at least the 17th century. During WWII, Roland Kilbon of the New York Sun, reported that other countries had used dogs in their armies for many years. In his column he quoted Mrs. Milton S. (Arlene) Erlanger, owner of Pillicoc Kennels, a premier breeder of Poodles \"The dog must play a game in this thing.\" Eventually, \"With the blessing of the American Kennel Club, the Professional Handlers Association, obedience training clubs across the country, and Seeing Eye, Inc., a nationwide program known as Dogs for Defense, Inc. was initiated and became the official procurement agency for all war dogs used in the Army, Navy and Coast Guard.\" \nDogs for Defense procured the dogs who were then trained by the Army. In 1942, the Poodle was one of 32 breeds officially classified as war dogs by the Army.\n\n\n== In competition ==\nStandard Poodles have been winning titles against the more widely used native breeds like the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, American Water Spaniel and Labrador Retriever. Thus far 13 Standard Poodles have won Master Hunt titles (12 in the United States, 1 in Canada) and several more have won senior and junior titles on both sides of the border. Currently only the United Kennel Club in the US recognizes the Standard Poodle as a Sporting dog, thus in spite of this subtype of poodle being ineligible for field competitions more and more are appearing in the field as waterfowl dogs and hunters of pheasant in tall grass, the latter especially in the Midwest.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe poodle is an active, intelligent and elegant dog, squarely built, and well proportioned. To ensure the desirable squarely built appearance, the length of body measured from the breastbone to the point of the rump approximates the height from the highest point of the shoulders to the ground. The eyes should be very dark, oval in shape, and have an alert and intelligent expression. The ears should fold over close to the head, set at, or slightly below, eye level. The coat should be of naturally curly texture, dense throughout, although most AKC-registered show dogs have a lion-cut or other, similarly shaven look. The sizes of the official AKC-recognized Poodle breeds are determined by height, not by weight.\nPoodles are bred in a variety of sizes, distinguished by adult shoulder (withers) height. The exact height cutoffs among the varieties vary slightly from country to country. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) recognizes four sizes of one breed: standard, medium, miniature, and toy. Non-FCI kennel clubs generally recognize three sizes, standard, miniature, and toy, sometimes as sizes of the same breed and sometimes as separate breeds.  Only the FCI describes a maximum size for Standard Poodles. France is the country responsible for the breed in the FCI, and in this country, the puppies of all sizes are listed together. \nThe terms royal standard, teacup, and tiny teacup are marketing names, and are not recognized by any major kennel club.\n\nAll the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale Poodles are in Group 9 Companion and Toy, Section 2 Poodle. All the Kennel Club poodles are in the Utility Group. All three sizes of poodles for the Australian National Kennel Council and the New Zealand Kennel Club are in the Non-sporting Group. The Canadian Kennel Club and the American Kennel Club place standard and miniature sizes in the Non-sporting Group, and the toy size in the Toy Group. The United Kennel Club places the miniature and toy in the Companion Group and the standard poodle in the Gundog Group.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nUnlike most dogs which have double coats, poodles have a single layer coat (no undercoat is present) composed of dense, curly fur that sheds minimally. They  could be considered hypoallergenic (though not completely allergen free). The poodle does shed, but instead of the fur coming off the dog, it becomes tangled in the surrounding hair. This can lead to matting without proper care. \nTexture ranges from coarse and woolly to soft and wavy. Poodle show clips require many hours of brushing and care per week, about 10 hours/week for a Standard Poodle. Poodles are usually clipped down into lower-maintenance cuts as soon as their show careers are over. Pet clips are much less elaborate than show and require much less maintenance. A pet owner can anticipate grooming a poodle every six to eight weeks.\n\n\n=== Clips ===\nGenerally, the owners clip their dogs as they want; however, if they want their dogs in conformation shows, a show clip is a requirement. Many breed registries allow only certain clips for poodles shown in conformation. In American Kennel Club (AKC) shows, adults must be shown in the \"Continental\" or \"English saddle\" clips. Dogs under 12 months old may be shown with a \"puppy clip\". The AKC allows the \"Sporting\" clip in Stud Dog and Brood Bitch classes, as well.Some sources believe the show clips evolved from working clips, which originally provided warmth to major joints when the dogs were immersed in cold water. The rest of the body is shaved for less drag in the water. Others express skepticism at this theory, instead citing the French circus as the origin of the entertaining and unique clips.The second puppy clip is also called the Scandinavian clip or puppy clip. It was invented by Swedish and Norwegian show groomers in the 1970s. It is the most common one in all sizes for shows in Europe, and is allowed for adult poodles to be shown in the FCI countries. The face, throat, belly, feet and the base of the tail are shaved five to seven days before the show to get a nice, smooth appearance of the shaved areas. The hair on the head is left to form a \"topknot\", fixed in place using latex bands, because in most European countries, hair spray is banned. The rest of the dog is shaped with scissors.In the continental clip, the face, throat, feet and part of the tail are shaved. The upper half of the front legs is shaved, leaving \"fluffy pompons\" around the ankles. The hindquarters are shaved except for pompons on the lower leg (from the hock to the base of the foot) and optional round areas (sometimes called \"rosettes\") over the hips. The continental clip is the most popular show clip today.The English saddle clip is similar to the continental, except for the hindquarters, which are not shaved except for a small, curved area on each flank (just behind the body), the feet, and bands just below the stifle (knee) and above the hock, leaving four (4) pompons. This clip is now rarely seen in standard poodles.Pet clips can be as simple or as elaborate as owners wish. The hair under the tail should always be kept short to keep feces from matting in the dog's curls. Most owners also keep the feet and face clipped short to prevent dirt from matting between toes, tear stains on lighter-coated poodles and food from matting around the dog's muzzle. Beyond these sanitary requirements, desired clips depend on owners' preferences. Some owners maintain a longer clip in winter than summer.\n\n\n=== Corded coat ===\nIn most cases, whether a poodle is in a pet or show clip, the hair is completely brushed out. Poodle hair can also be \"corded\" with rope-like mats similar to those of a Komondor or human dreadlocks. Though once as common as the curly poodle, corded poodles are now rare. Corded coats are difficult to keep clean and take a long time to dry after washing. Any poodle with a normal coat can be corded when its adult coat is in. Corded poodles may be shown in all major kennel club shows.\nDifferent clips\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Colours ==\nThe Poodle has a wide variety of colouring, including white, black, brown, parti, silver, gray, silver beige, apricot, red, cream, sable, and patterns such as phantom and brindle. The AKC recognizes Poodles in either solid-coloured or particoloured coats. Recognition of particolour (spotted) Poodles varies by registry. Phantom, brindle, and sable are considered out of standard by all major registries. Recognized FCI colourations are black, white, brown, gray, apricot, and red.\nFor solid-coloured poodles, the coat is an even and solid colour at the skin. In blues, grays, silvers, browns, cafe-au-laits, apricots and creams, the coat may show varying shades of the same colour. This is frequently present in the somewhat darker feathering of the ears and in the tipping of the ruff. While clear colours are preferred by registries, such natural variation in the shading of the coat is not to be considered a fault. Brown and cafe-au-lait poodles have liver-coloured noses, eye rims and lips, dark toenails and dark amber eyes. Black, blue, gray, silver, cream and white poodles have black noses, eye rims and lips, black or self-coloured toenails and very dark eyes. In the apricots, while the foregoing colouring is preferred, liver-coloured noses, eye rims and lips, and amber eyes are permitted, but are not desirable. Incomplete colour of nose, lips and eye rims, or a \"mismatched\" colour are considered faults by registries.\nParti-coloured poodles are recognized in poodle history as the original colouring of the poodle. A parti poodle has solid-coloured patches over a white coat. The coat will usually be white and coloured in equal amounts, though it can vary with a larger percent of white.  Registries prefer that parti poodles have the same points as its correlating solid-coloured descendants.  Brown and white parti poodles have liver-coloured noses, eye rims and lips, dark or self-coloured toenails and amber eyes. This is also permitted, but not preferred, in apricot and white parti poodles. Black/white, Blue/white, and silver/white poodles have black noses, eye rims and lips, black or self-coloured toenails and very dark eyes. When the dog has markings that resemble those of a tuxedo, it is called a \"tuxedo\" poodle. The upper coat is solid: head, back, tail; and the lower coat is white: neck, chest, abdomen, and legs, making up usually 40% or more of the coat.\nPhantom poodles have the colouring of a Doberman Pinscher, with a lighter colour appearing on their \"eyebrows\", muzzle and throat, legs and feet and below their tail. Like Dobermans, phantom poodles have either a black or brown main coat with a tan (usually apricot or red) lighter colourings around the eyebrows, muzzle, throat, legs, feet, and below their tail.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nPoodles are known as a highly intelligent, energetic, and sociable breed. They require both physical and intellectual activities. Of note is this breed's keen sense for instinctive behavior. In particular, marking and hunting drives are more readily observable in poodles than in most other breeds. A typical poodle should be reserved with strangers upon first introduction, but after a while should slowly reveal a warm and personable disposition. Snappy, vicious behavior is considered a serious fault in the breed.Poodles are highly trainable dogs that typically excel in obedience training. A poodle will do well at many dog sports, including dog agility, flyball, dock diving, field tracking, and even schutzhund, and can follow owners on hiking trips or any trip involving swimming, as long as the dog is accustomed to water and swimming.\nOf the size varieties, Standard Poodles are the most highly recommended for families with children. They have a kindly demeanor and a love of playing games. As with all dogs and babies, introductions should be gradual, though most Standards will tolerate a baby and learn to be gentle and will respect toddlers so long as the child is supervised. A Standard Poodle will be fine in a family with many children provided the environment is stable, orderly, and relaxed, with enough room for the dog to go out and retire to if needed. Miniature and Toy varieties tend to have less patience with young children and might find certain children's antics too much to handle, especially because young  children are much larger than they are and may attempt to grab them without understanding how their attempt to hug the pooch is terrifying to a small dog. They are likely to bite out of fear and thus are better suited to homes with teenagers or older children. Poodles dislike being left alone or left out of the family fun and some get anxious at being left in the house alone, but sign of nervousness or neurosis is atypical and not how a poodle of any size is meant to behave.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe most common serious health issues of Standard Poodles listed in order of the number of reported cases in the Poodle Health Registry (20 August 2007) are Addison's disease, gastric dilatation volvulus, thyroid issues (hyperthyroid and hypothyroid), tracheal collapse, epilepsy, sebaceous adenitis, juvenile renal disease, hip dysplasia, and cancer. Standard Poodles are also susceptible to some health issues usually too minor to report to the health registry. The most common of these minor issues is probably ear infection. Ear infections are a problem in all poodle varieties because their nonshedding coat grows into the ear canal, where it traps wax and dirt. Ear problems can be minimized by proper ear care, including regular cleaning and plucking of hair within the ear canal. A veterinarian should be consulted if the dog shows signs of an ear infection.\nStandard Poodles in UK, Denmark and USA/Canada surveys had a median lifespan of 11.5 to 12 years. In a UK survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (30%), old age (18%), GDV (6%), and cardiac disease (5%).Miniature and Toy Poodles in UK surveys had median lifespans of 14 to 14.5 years. In Miniatures, the leading cause of death was old age (39%). In Toys, the leading causes of death were old age (25%), and kidney failure (20%).\n\n\n=== Addison's disease ===\nAddison's disease is (as of 20 August 2007) the illness most commonly reported to the Poodle Health Registry. The number of reported cases is nearly twice as high as the next most common problem (GDV). Addison's disease is characterized by insufficient production of glucocorticoid and/or mineralocortoid in the adrenal cortex (near the kidneys). Addison's is often undiagnosed because early symptoms are vague and easily mistaken for other conditions. Standard Poodles with unexplained lethargy, frequent gastric disturbances, or an inability to tolerate stress should be tested for it. Addison's can cause fatal sodium/potassium imbalances, but if caught early and treated with lifelong medication, most dogs can live a relatively normal life.\n\n\n=== Gastric dilatation volvulus ===\nThere is a high incidence of gastric dilatation volvulus (GDV) in this breed, which occurs when twisting of the stomach (volvulus or torsion) causes or is caused by excess gas. Symptoms include restlessness, inability to get comfortable, pacing, or retching without being able to bring up anything. The dog's abdomen may be visibly swollen, but bloat or torsion can occur without visible swelling. A dog with GDV requires immediate veterinary care. The dog's survival usually depends on whether the owner can get to a veterinarian in time.\nGDV risk is increased with faster eating and a raised feeding bowl.\n\n\n=== Reproduction ===\nBreed size is correlated with litter size and Standard Poodles have the highest litter size followed by Medium, Miniature, and Toy. Toy Poodles have one of the smallest litter size of all breeds. The stillborn rate and early neonatal mortality (death within 1 week from birth) in poodles are lower than the average across all breeds.\n\n\n== Poodle crossbreeds ==\n\nPoodles are crossed with other breeds for various reasons, and the resulting puppies (called designer dogs) are described by whimsical portmanteau words, such as cockapoo or spoodle (Cocker Spaniel), maltipoo (Maltese), goldendoodle (Golden Retriever), labradoodle (Labrador), Schnoodle (Schnauzer), Pekapoos (Pekingese), Cavapoo (Cavalier King Charles), Bernedoodle (Bernese Mountain Dog) and many others.\nA cross between a shedding breed and a poodle (which does not shed much) does not reliably produce a nonshedding dog. Traits of puppies from crossbreedings are not as predictable as those from purebred poodle breedings, and the crosses may shed or have unexpected or undesirable qualities from the parent breeds.\nPoodle crossbreds (also called hybrids) are not recognized by any major breed registry, as crossbreds are not one breed of dog, but two. If both parents are registered purebreds but of different breeds, it is still not possible to register a puppy as two different breeds. Some minor registries and Internet registry businesses will register dogs as any breed the owner chooses with minimal or no documentation; some even allow the breeder or owner to make up a new \"breed name\".\n\n\n== Hypoallergenic qualities ==\nPoodles are often cited as a hypoallergenic dog breed. Their individual hair follicles have an active growth period that is longer than that of many other breeds of dogs; combined with the tightly curled coat, which slows the loss of dander and dead hair by trapping it in the curls, an individual poodle may release less dander and hair into the environment. In addition, most poodles are frequently brushed and bathed to keep them looking their best; this not only removes hair and dander, but also controls the other potent allergen, saliva.Although hair, dander, and saliva can be minimized, they are still present and can stick to \"clothes and the carpets and furnishings in your home\"; inhaling them, or being licked by the dog, can trigger a reaction in a sensitive person. An air cleaner, air duct outlet and vacuuming with a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter can help clear dander floating in the air.The word hypoallergenic, when referring to a dog, is also a misconception; all dogs shed. Poodles shed hair in minimal amounts, and also release dander, but are not as likely to trigger allergies as much as many other breeds. Additionally, poodle maintenance must include some amount of regular shaving, which releases hair dust in the air.\n\n\n== Cultural visibility ==\nPoodles are commonly known as extensively groomed show dogs and companions with a distinctive clip, to such a degree that poodles in short pet clips often go unrecognized or mistaken as Poodle crosses (\"Doodles\"). This association of the breed's appearance and the resulting preconceptions is strong, and reflects in popular culture, where poodles most often are depicted as spoiled and perhaps obnoxious pets, or if anthropomorphic, snobby, selfish, and vain. Poodle owners are perceived stereotypically as fussy, frivolous, and impractical.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nPoodle at Curlie"}, {"id": 385, "name": "Porcelaine", "country": "France", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog385", "description": "The Porcelaine [p\u0254\u0281s\u0259l\u025bn] is a breed of dog originating from France. It is believed to be the oldest of the French scent hounds. Its alternate name is the Chien de Franche-Comt\u00e9, named after a French region bordering Switzerland. This caused some debate over the dog's origin, but it has been decided that it is a French dog.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Porcelaine gets its name from its shiny coat, said to make it resemble a porcelain statuette.  The fur is white, sometimes with orange spots, often on the ears. The skin should be white with black mottling that is visible through the white coat. The fur is incredibly short and very fine. The nose of a Porcelaine dog is black with very wide nostrils. It also has black eyes and long ears that droop down. The neck is long and the tail starts thick and narrows to a point at the end.\nPorcelaine males range from 22 to 23 inches (about 56 to 58.5 centimeters) tall. Bitches are 21 to 22 inches (about 53.5 to 56 centimeters) tall. They weigh from 55 to 62 pounds (about 25 to 28 kilograms).\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nPorcelaines have a very high activity level and therefore need a lot of exercise. Because of this, they are not recommended for people living in apartments because they cannot get sufficient exercise without a lot of work on the owner's part. Despite the Porcelaines being fierce hunters, they are gentle and relatively easy to handle.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Porcelaine is thought to be a descendant of the English Harrier, some of the smaller Laufhounds of Switzerland, and the now-extinct Montaimboeuf. There have been records of the breed in France since 1845 and in Switzerland since 1880. The breed actually disappeared after the French Revolution (1789\u201399) but has been reconstructed.\nBreeders in the UK are attempting to have the Porcelaine accepted as a recognized breed.  As of 2009 there have been 14 puppies bred in the UK.\n\n\n== Health ==\nPorcelaines have no health issues specific to the breed. Of course, they suffer from general dog issues like any other breed.\n\n\n== Care ==\nThe coat, due to its shortness, is very easy to care for.\n\n\n== Hunting purposes ==\nThe Porcelaine is a hunting dog usually used to hunt hare, roe deer, and in the north wild boar. The Porcelaines hunt in packs. Being a scent hound, it has a very good sense of smell with which it hunts. The Porcelaine is a fierce hunting dog that has been bred to hunt independently without many orders from the owner. The Porcelaine is also being bred in small numbers in Italy and used to hunt wild boar, however Italian indigenous hounds continue to be the preferred choice of local hunters.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nClub du Porcelaine (in French)"}, {"id": 386, "name": "Portuguese Podengo", "country": "Portugal", "type": "Sighthound and Pariah", "picture": "dog386", "description": "The Portuguese Podengo is an ancient multi-sensory hound (sight and scent) breed of dog from Portugal. As a breed, the Podengo is divided into three size categories that are not interbred: small (Pequeno), medium (M\u00e9dio) and large (Grande). Their coats are either short and 'smooth', or longer and 'wired'. The smooth coated variety is traditional, dating back to the 5th century, whereas the wire coated variety is an outcome of the assimilation of various other breeds during the 20th century. In general, the breed is healthy; the Pequeno (small) variety has an average lifespan of approximately 15\u201317 years.\nAll Podengo types are hardy, intelligent and lively dogs, excelling at agility and making fine companions. Loyal and fearless, Podengos are also good house guards and are amenable to training by dog experienced people and those that enjoy  primitive (unrefined, \"less domesticated\") dog behavior.\nKeen hunting dogs, the Podengo has an affinity for game regardless of size. Typically, the dogs hunt in a pack with their handler following. When game is found, they kill and retrieve it, or flush it towards the hunter to be shot. Each size category traditionally hunts game appropriate to their size and temperament. (Pequeno: rabbits; Medio: rabbits and wild boar; Grande: deer and wild boar).\n\n\n== Registration and representation ==\nThe Portuguese Podengo in the UK is represented by The Portuguese Podengo Club of Great Britain and The Northern Portuguese Podengo Association, and the Podengo Pequeno was recognized by the Kennel Club in 2003. The Breed Standard was approved on January 1, 2006. The Podengo Pequeno was transferred from the Import Register into the Breed Register on January 1, 2008 at the Kennel Club. The Podengo Pequeno now has its own breed classes at Championship Shows and Open Shows (the other sizes are in the process of being included). The Podengo Pequeno was shown at Crufts for the first time in 2009. There are approximately 500 Podengos (primarily Pequeno) now resident in the UK.\nAll three sizes and varieties of the Portuguese Podengo have been registered at the United Kennel Club since 2004 and are in the Sighthound & Pariah Group. The Podengo Pequeno became AKC recognized in January 2013 and is now registered there. Incorporated in 2009, Portuguese Podengo Pequenos of America is the AKC club for the breed in the US and is mostly in a few western states and the Midwest. The Portuguese Podengo Pequeno Club of America (PPPCA), founded in 2001, is the first and largest club of Podengo Pequeno owners in the USA and is in 40 states. They are the only club dedicated to BOTH the wire coat and the smooth coat varieties of the breed. The PPPCA was incorporated in January 2003 in Newport, Rhode Island and 85% of its members own Portuguese Podengo Pequenos. Other organizations that recognize the Podengo (all sizes) in the US are the United Kennel Club, American Rare Breed Association, North American Kennel Club and The American Sighthound Field Association.  The Portuguese Podengo Medio and Grande are represented in the United States by The American Portuguese Podengo Medio/Grande Club (APPMGC or 'MGC').The United Kingdom registers the most Podengos, followed by Finland, the United States and Portugal.\nIn Europe, the Podengo is classified by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) as Group 5: Spitz and primitive type, Section 7: Primitive type hunting dogs. The FCI breed standard, which originates in Portugal, governs all types and varieties of the Portuguese Podengo. In both the United States and the UK the Portuguese Podengo is classified in the Hound Group.\n\n\n== Types and varieties ==\nThere are three sizes of Podengos: Podengo Pequeno, Podengo Medio and Podengo Grande.\nWithin each size type are two varieties: smooth (also referred to as smooth coat) and wire (also referred to as wire coat, wirehaired, longhaired or rough coat).\nAll of these types are called 'Portuguese Podengo' as a 'breed,' although none of these six types are interbred.\n\nPortuguese Podengo Pequeno (Smooth)\nPortuguese Podengo Pequeno (Wire)\nPortuguese Podengo Medio (Smooth)\nPortuguese Podengo Medio (Wire)\nPortuguese Podengo Grande (Smooth)\nPortuguese Podengo Grande (Wire)In its home country, the Podengo is referred to as Small, Medium or Large Podengo.\nIt is acceptable for the hair description to come before or after the 'type' name.\nIn the United States, the American Kennel Club split the Podengo Pequeno from the other two sizes as a separate breed. This was done primarily to prevent the interbreeding of the Pequeno with the Medio.\n\n\n== General information ==\nThe Grande (large) was developed for deer and wild boar hunting. It will exhaust and hold down the prey and await the hunter's gun. The Grande is now very rare in its home country.The Medio (medium) was developed for rabbit chasing, flushing, hunting and retrieval. Its hunting style includes catlike stalking and, similar to the Ibizan Hound, it often jumps above the prey before landing on or near it to flush it out of dense brush, rock crevices or burrows. It will dig if necessary to flush prey.The Pequeno (small) was also developed for flushing rabbits from cover. It is also a good mouser and was probably kept on board explorer ships when the Portuguese initiated the European worldwide explorations in the 15th and 16th centuries.In the United States, the United Kennel Club (UKC) represents the breed as shown in Portugal and all FCI countries \u2014 the three sizes, all with two coat varieties \u2014 as one breed. The American Kennel Club (AKC) has divided the breed into the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno and the Portuguese Podengo (includes the Medio and Grande size). This breed Portuguese Podengo is represented by the American Portuguese Podengo Medio/Grande Club. The Pequeno entered the AKC Misc class in January 2011 and entered the Hound Class in January 2013.  The Portuguese Podengo (which includes the Medio and Grande), will enter AKC Miscellaneous Class on January 1, 2014.\n\n\n== Portuguese Podengo Pequeno ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Portuguese Podengo Pequeno is characterized by a wedge shaped head, with erect ears and a curved tail. The AKC breed standards include the following points: \n\nHeight: 8 to 12 in (20 to 30 cm)\nWeight: 9 to 13 lb (4.1 to 5.9 kg)\nColor: yellow or fawn\nCoat: wire coat (a rough, single coat \u2014 no undercoat; does shed but not very much) or smooth coat (a dense smooth coat with undercoat that is low maintenance. It naturally sheds dust and dirt and dries very quickly)\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nPodengo Pequeno are small, friendly, hardy, lively and intelligent companions. They are very active and usually good with children and other animals when socialized from an early age. They enjoy time with their human family.\nLike their Medio relatives, they are very watchful and observant and will bark when something gets their attention. They enjoy running and sunshine and must have a secure enclosed fence. The Podengo Pequeno is trained well with positive techniques and should be kept on leash all of the time during training as they can be quite autonomous and have their own ideas about what constitutes proper behavior. They can be remarkably silly in the home. A walk with many Pequenos can be a delight and they will continually come back to the owner to make sure they are coming along.\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe Portuguese Podengo Pequeno accompanied Portuguese explorers on their ships for ratting purposes after the Portuguese completed the reconquest of their country from the Moors in the 13th century.\nWire Coat Pequenos were first shown in the United States in 2001 when Chicharro de Viamonte, owned by Marilyn Piurek and Kip Bergstrom, was exhibited at an ARBA show in Boston. He was the first Podengo to ever be shown in the United States and the first Podengo Pequeno champion in ARBA and Rarities. Smooth coat Pequenos were first shown in the United States in 2003. The Viamonte podengos were the first family of Podengos pequenos in the United States, followed by Gelado de Viamonte \"Chico\" in 2004. Wire Coat Pequenos were first imported to the UK in 2002. The smooth coated Pequeno followed in 2004. Most (75%)of the purebred Portuguese Podengos in the United States consist of the Pequeno size, and most of these (85%) are of the wire coat variety.\n\n\n== Portuguese Podengo Medio ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nWIRE COATThe WPM is a medium-sized type with a rough coat that functions as an air conditioner in the hot weather. This coat was preferred in the South of their native Portugal, which is very warm. The single coat (without undercoat) does shed but not very much.\n\nSMOOTH COATThe SPM is a medium-sized type with a dense smooth single layer coat that is extremely low maintenance. It naturally sheds dust and dirt and dries very quickly. For that reason the Smooth Coat variety is preferred in the North of their native Portugal, which has rainy winters. The single coat (without undercoat) does shed but not very much.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nBoth kinds of Podengo Medio are  friendly, hardy and intelligent companions. They are very active and usually good with children and other animals, including livestock, especially when socialized from an early age.\nThey are watchful and observant and will bark when something gets their attention. Most enjoy digging and need a secure fence, optimally enclosing their own yard.  As they are very agile, regular fencing might not be enough, as they are excellent jumpers and climbers. The best way to address this is with a high enough fence to prevent jumping and a \"fence\" below the ground, preferably of hardware cloth.\nWhen trained, Podengo Medios can have good recall when not on leash. While hiking with them, they generally stay in visual distance and \"check\" on their owners frequently, always being aware of their position (although that can mean a few acres away). Of course, they must be trained with a reliable recall first.\nThey are enthusiastic, trainable dogs. This led them to star in a number of movies in the 1990s and 2000s, including Dante's Peak, Three Wishes, Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco, Zeus and Roxanne, Secondhand Lions, Can of Worms and Soccer Dog: The Movie. Also The Lake House\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe Portuguese Podengo Medio, both smooth and wire-haired, has existed, unregistered, in the United States for decades in small numbers with Portuguese-Americans in private home settings, where they have been used for traditional rabbit hunting.  They were never really popularized outside of their immigrant homesteads. They are attractive, nice family dogs, with a touch of mischief. The first group of Podengo Medio fanciers met in the US in the early 90's via the early internet Gopher (protocol) system. Registered purebred Smooth Podengo Medios began being shown in America in 2004 and registered purebred Wirehaired Podengo Medios began being shown in America in 2005.\nThe first Wirehaired Podengo Medio to be shown in North America was AM/CDN Ch Evita V.D. Kleiheuvel, owned by Mary Dixon at a United Kennel Club show in Belleville, Michigan. Evita became the first WPM United States Champion (with United Kennel Club) and the first Canadian Podengo Champion (with Canine Federation of Canada). The first Podengo Medio born in North America was Ch Marcos de Retrouvaille and was bred by Dixon. The first Podengo to earn an American Kennel Club Tracking Dog title (on February 17, 2008) was Jolena De Retrouvaille WM, bred by Mary Dixon.\nStill rare, breeders in Portugal primarily breed for rabbit hunting, not pets. They are hunting dogs, often kept in kennels, not in homes. The idea of Wirehaired Podengo Medios being kept more as house pets began with breeders in Europe.\n\n\n== Portuguese Podengo Grande ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nWIRE COATThe WPG is a large-sized type with a tough but even temperament and a rough coat that primarily functions as a briar-protectant when hunting wild boar.\nThe single coat (without undercoat) does shed but not very much.\nRegistered WPGs are very rare, even in its home country and is not yet available to export.\n\nSMOOTH COATThe SPG is a large-sized type with a dense smooth single layer coat that also functions as a briar-protectant when hunting wild boar. The registered SPG is still rare in its home country, with very few individuals available for export.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nBoth kinds of Podengo Grande are known to be tough, hardy and intelligently observant animals. They must be socialized very well and carefully by a primitive breed-experienced handler. They are used primarily for hunting wild boar in large packs, where they are released from kennel trucks and sent to chase the boar to its den. They then continue to harass it until it emerges in its attack mode. The dogs then jump in and attach to the boar from all angles and dispatch it swiftly. The waiting hunter can then retrieve the prey.\nThey will be good guardians and require a securely fenced yard (at least 6 ft tall). They enjoy digging dens, also, like their other Podengo relations. It is most closely related to the Podengo Medio, in fact, Podengo Medios which grow too tall for the Medio standard may be classified as Podengo Grandes.  This arrangement does not exist in any other way within the Podengo group. Training will be firm but fair with the Podengo Grande as it must have respect for its handler and be amenable to training.\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe Portuguese Podengo Grande may have existed, unregistered, in North America with Portuguese-Americans in private home settings, where they have been used for deer and wild pig hunting. The first Podengo Grande was imported to the US in 2008 and the first litter born in 2009 as well as the import of 4 Grande of the wire coat. 2010 brought the second litter of Grande. Breeders in Portugal continue to breed primarily for hunting and the PG is kept and raised in kennels.\nThere is a unique system currently in place in Portugal where unregistered dogs (denoted by the kennel club of Portugal as R.I. or 'Initial Registration') may be evaluated by breed experts and used in a breeding program. Succeeding generations, also evaluated by said experts, may eventually result in a 3 generation pedigree of known, evaluated, 'R.I.' dogs which would thus create a full pedigree for certain formerly \"RI\" Podengos. This process is carried forth under rules established by the CPC and is not exportable to other countries as it relies on the presence of indigenous wild specimens of the breed.\nIn the United States the American Kennel Club (AKC) has determined that the Medio and Grande size together are to be called 'Portuguese Podengo' as one breed. It will be registered by the AKC in the Hound Group.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 387, "name": "Portuguese Pointer", "country": "Portugal", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog387", "description": "A Portuguese Pointer, (Portuguese: Perdigueiro Portugu\u00eas) is a breed of dog developed as a gun dog. It is one of several pointing breeds and is mainly used in red-legged partridge hunting.\nThe Portuguese pointer (perdigueiro Portugu\u00eas) arose from the ancient Iberian hunting dogs with its presence in Portugal traceable to the early twelfth century. Initially the dog was bred in the royal kennels and later became a very popular hunting dog for the lower classes of society. In the eighteenth century, many English families established a presence in the region of Oporto in the business of wine production and came to know the Portuguese hunting breed which was taken to England where they played a part in the origin of the English pointer. However, during the nineteenth century when Portugal was experiencing considerable social hardships, the breed began a progressive decline. It was not until the 1920s when some breeders made an effort to salvage the breed by locating some of the ancient Portuguese dogs in the inaccessible north of Portugal. The Portuguese pedigree book was then established in 1932 and breed standard in 1938. For at least a thousand years, this dog has always had the same square head, a marked stop, triangular ears and compact look and since the 17th century, the same docked tail, and among pointing dogs all over the world just the perdigueiro and his \"son\" the English pointer have this kind of skull-facial convergence so typical.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Portuguese Pointer is a dog of medium proportions.\nWhen being evaluated at a conformation show, dogs judged for conformation that benefits working ability, with deviations from the standard penalised according to the amount that they interfere with working ability. The dogs are square in build, with the 10:10\u00bd height to length ratio. The tail is docked to half, or two-thirds the natural length, and held level with the spine when the dog is excited, hanging down otherwise.\n\n\n=== Coat and colour ===\nThe coat is short and coarse on most of the dog, being the texture of velvet on the ears and face.\nIts standard colour is yellow or light brown, both unicoloured or with white markings.\n\n\n=== Size ===\nThe height at the withers is  48\u201356 cm (19\u201322 in) .

Portuguese Water Dogs are originally from the Portuguese region of the Algarve, from where the breed expanded to all around Portugal's coast, where they were taught to herd fish into fishermen's nets, to retrieve lost tackle or broken nets, and to act as couriers from ship to ship, or ship to shore.\nPortuguese Water Dogs rode in fishing trawlers as they worked their way from the Atlantic waters of Portugal to the waters off the coast of Iceland fishing for cod.In Portuguese, the breed is called c\u00e3o de \u00e1gua (IPA: [\u02c8k\u0250\u0303w d\u0268 \u02c8a\u0261w\u0250]; literally 'dog of water'). In Portugal, the dog is also known as the Algarvian Water Dog (c\u00e3o de \u00e1gua algarvio), or Portuguese Fishing Dog (c\u00e3o pescador portugu\u00eas). c\u00e3o de \u00e1gua de p\u00ealo ondulado is the name given to the wavy-haired variety, and c\u00e3o de \u00e1gua de p\u00ealo encaracolado is the name for the curly-coated variety.The Portuguese Water Dog is a fairly rare breed; only 36 Portuguese Water Dogs were entered for Britain's Crufts competition in 2013. Though some breeders claim they are a hypoallergenic dog breed, there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that hypoallergenic dog breeds exist. Their non-shedding qualities have made them more popular in recent years.\nThe Portuguese Water Dog has recently gained more fame by being the chosen breed of US President Barack Obama, who has two of them, Bo and Sunny. The Obama family chose Sunny for the breed's comparatively hypoallergenic nature, while Bo was given to them by Senator Ted Kennedy.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe closest relatives of the PWD are widely thought to be the Standard Poodle. Like Poodles and several other water dog breeds, PWDs are intelligent, can have curly coats, have webbed toes for swimming, and do not shed. However, Portuguese Water Dogs are more robustly built, with stout legs, and can have a wavy coat instead of tightly curled. If comparing the structure to that of a Poodle, there are significant differences between the two breeds. The Portuguese Water Dog is built of strong substantial bone; well developed, neither refined nor coarse, and a solidly built, muscular body. The Portuguese Water Dog is off-square, slightly longer than tall when measured from prosternum to rearmost point of the buttocks, and from withers to ground. Portuguese Water Dog eyes are black or various tones of brown, and their coats can be black, brown, black and white or brown and white.Male Portuguese Water Dogs usually grow to be about 20 to 23 inches (51 to 58 cm) tall, and they weigh between 40 and 60 pounds (18 and 27 kg), while the females usually grow to be about 17 to 21 inches (43 to 53 cm) tall, and they weigh between 35 and 50 pounds (16 and 23 kg).\n\n\n=== Coat types ===\nPWDs have a single-layered coat that does not shed (see Moult), and therefore their presence is tolerated well among many people who suffer from dog allergies. Persons with dog allergies, however, should consult their medical advisor before considering the purchase of any dog.Most PWDs, especially those shown in conformation shows, are entirely black, black and white, brown, or silver-tipped; it is common to see white chest spots and white paws or legs on black or brown coated dogs. \"Parti\" or \"Irish-marked\" coats, with irregular white and black spots, are rare but visually striking. \"Parti\" dogs are becoming more common in the United States. However, in Portugal the breed standard does not allow more than 30% white markings. Overall, white is the least common Portuguese Water Dog color, while black with white markings on the chin (\"milk chin\") and chest is the most common color.\nFrom the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America Revised Standard for the Portuguese Water Dog come these descriptions of the two coat types:\nCurly coat: \"Compact, cylindrical curls, somewhat lusterless. The hair on the ears is sometimes wavy.\"\nWavy coat: \"Falling gently in waves, not curls, and with a slight sheen.\"Many dogs have mixed pattern hair: curly all over the body but wavy on the tail and ears.\n\n\n=== Grooming styles ===\nIf left untended, the hair on a PWD will keep growing indefinitely. Problems associated with this include the hair around the eyes growing so long as to impede vision, and matting of the body hair, which can cause skin irritations. For these reasons, PWDs must be trimmed about every two months and the coat brushed every other day.\nThe coat is usually worn in a \"retriever cut\" or a \"lion cut\".\n\n\n==== The lion cut ====\nIn the lion cut, the hindquarters, muzzle, and the base of the tail are shaved and the rest of the body is left full length. This traditional cut originated with the fishing dogs of Portugal. The lion cut diminished the initial shock of cold water when jumping from boats, as well as providing warmth to the vitals. The hindquarters were left shaved to allow easier movement of the back legs and the powerful, rudder-like tail.\n\n\n==== The retriever cut ====\nThe retriever cut is one inch (2.5 cm) long, evenly over the body (although some owners prefer the muzzle or the base of the tail shorter). This cut is a more recent style and originated because breeders wanted to make the breed more appealing to buyers. Sometimes owners will clip the hair of their dogs very short, especially in the summer months, in modified retriever cut.\n\n\n=== Vocalisation ===\nPortuguese Water Dogs have a multi-octave voice. They tend to be quiet dogs although they will warn when the home is approached, and they will communicate their desires vocally and behaviourally to their owner. Their bark is loud and distinctive. They may engage in \"expressive panting\", by making a distinct \"ha-ha-ha-ha\" sound as an invitation to play or to indicate a desire for nearby food. They sometimes whine.The PWD's biddability, high intelligence, and tendency to vocalise and then seek out its human master when specific alarms occur make it an ideal hearing-ear or deaf-assistance dog. PWDs can be readily trained to bark loudly when a telephone rings, and then to find and alert a hard-of-hearing or deaf master.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nPortuguese Water dogs are loving, independent, and intelligent and are easily trained in obedience and agility skills. They are generally friendly to strangers, and enjoy being petted, which, due to their soft, fluffy coats, is a favour that human beings willingly grant them.Because they are working dogs, PWDs are generally content in being at their master's side, awaiting directions, and, if they are trained, they are willing and able to follow complex commands. They learn very quickly, seem to enjoy the training, and have a long memory for the names of objects. These traits and their non-shedding coats mean they excel at the various service dog roles such as hearing dogs (assistance dogs for the deaf), mobility dogs, and seizure response dogs. They also make unusually good therapy dogs.A PWD usually stays in proximity to its owners, both indoors and outdoors. Although very gregarious animals, these dogs will typically bond with one primary or alpha family member. Some speculate that this intense bonding arose in the breed because the dogs were selected to work in proximity to their masters on small fishing boats, unlike other working dogs such as herding dogs and water dogs that range out to perform tasks. In any case, the modern PWD, whether employed on a boat or kept as a pet or a working dog, loves water and attention and prefers to be engaged in activity within sight of a human partner. This is not a breed to be left alone for long periods of time, indoors or out.As water dogs, the PWD's retrieving instinct is strong, which also gives some dogs tugging and chewing tendencies. A PWD will commonly jump as a greeting. Owners may choose to limit this behavior. Some PWDs may walk, hop, or \"dance\" on their hind legs when greeting or when excited. Some PWDs will stand upright at kitchen counters and tables, especially if they smell food above them. This habit is known as \"counter surfing\" and is characteristic of the breed.\nBecause of their intelligence and working drive, they require regular intensive exercise as well as mental challenges. They are gentle and patient \u2014 but not \"couch potatoes\", and boredom can cause them to become destructive.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== In ancient times ===\n\nOne theory proposes that some of the dogs left the Asian steppes with the Goths, a confederation of German tribes. Some, (the Ostrogoths), went west and their dogs became the German poodle, called in German the poodle-hund or puddle-dog\u2014that is, water-dog. Others, the Visigoths, went south to fight the Romans, and their dogs became the Lion Dog, groomed in the traditional lion cut. In 413 CE, the Visigoths invaded Iberia before being settled in Aquitania north of the Pyrenees in 418, ultimately extending their rule to most of Iberia after 470 CE.A Portuguese Water Dog is first described in 1297 in a monk\u2019s account of a drowning sailor who was pulled from the sea by a dog with a \"black coat, the hair long and rough, cut to the first rib and with a tail tuft\".These theories explain how the Poodle and the Portuguese Water Dog may have developed from the same ancient genetic pool. At one time the Poodle was a longer-coated dog, as is one variety of the Portuguese Water Dog. The possibility also exists that some of the long-coated water dogs grew up with the ancient Iberians. In early times, Celtiberians migrated from lands which now belong to southwestern Germany. Swarming over the Pyrenees, circulating over the whole of western Europe, they established bases in Iberia, as well as in Ireland, Wales, and Brittany.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nThe PWD was a breed on the verge of extinction when, during the 1930s, Vasco Bensaude, a wealthy Portuguese shipping magnate, began to seek out fishermen's dogs for use in a breeding program to re-establish the breed. Bensaude's kennel was named Algarbiorum, and his most famous dog was Le\u00e3o (1931\u20131942), a very \"type-y\" (that is, standard-conformant) fisherman's stud dog, who was bred to so many different females that about half of the pedigreed Portuguese Water Dogs in existence can trace their lineage back to him. Bensaude was aided by two Portuguese veterinarians, Dr. Francisco Pinto Soares and Dr. Manuel Fernandes Marques. His work was carried on by Conchita Cintron de Castelo Branco, to whom he gave his last 17 PWDs and all his archives.Dr. Ant\u00f3nio Cabral was the founder of the Avalade kennels in Portugal. Ch. Charlie de Avalade (Charlie), a brown-coated dog, and C. B. Baluarte de Avalade (Balu) were two of his many famous PWDs. He registered his first PWD in 1954, after Bensaude had pioneered the re-establishment of the breed in Portugal. Cabral worked with Carla Molinari, Deyanne Miller, Sonja Santos and others to establish PWDs in the US. The \"Mark of Cabral\" is a triangular shape of different color/textured hair, usually 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) from the base of the tail.Deyanne Miller is the person most responsible for the rise of the PWD in America. In 1972, the Millers, along with 14 others, formed the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America, Inc. (PWDCA). She worked with dogs from both the Cintron and Cabral lineages to establish a stable genetic pool of PWDs in the US at her Farmion kennels. Another early US breeder of PWDs was actor Raymond Burr.\n\n\n== Genetic diseases ==\nAs with all purebred dogs, PWDs are vulnerable to certain genetic defects. Due to the limited gene pool for this breed, conscientious breeders carefully study pedigrees and select dogs to minimize the chance of genetic disease and improper coat. As with many other breeds, growing popularity has encouraged breeding by people not knowledgeable about the breed.\n\n\n=== Hip dysplasia ===\nLike poodles, PWDs are vulnerable to hip dysplasia, a congenital and developmental problem with the hip joints. However, the risk of a PWD developing hip dysplasia can be greatly reduced by thoroughly checking the pedigrees and health clearances in both the sire and dam of the dog.\n\n\n=== Cataracts, progressive retinal atrophy, and distichiasis ===\nCataracts and progressive retinal atrophy are two eye diseases found in PWDs. Progressive retinal atrophy, which causes \"night blindness\", may lead to complete blindness. This is a simple recessive gene. DNA testing, known as \"Optigen Testing\", can identify dogs carrying the gene for progressive retinal atrophy. \"Normal\" or \"A\" dogs do not carry the gene. \"Carriers\" or \"B\" dogs carry one copy of the gene and will not express the disease, but pass the gene to 50% of their offspring. \"Affected\" or \"C\" dogs have two copies of the progressive retinal atrophy gene and will probably express the disease as late onset progressive retinal atrophy. \"B\" or \"C\" dogs should be bred only to \"A\" dogs to ensure that any offspring will not express the disease.Ingrown eyelashes (distichiasis) occur in some curly-coated breeds, but they are not particularly common in PWDs. Ingrown eyelashes will rub the eye causing extensive corneal ulcerations. The condition is minor so long as it is not ignored, and can be surgically treated if necessary.\n\n\n=== GM1 Storage Disease ===\nGM1 storage disease, one of a family of conditions called GM1 gangliosidoses, is a recessive, genetic disorder that is inevitably fatal. It is caused by a deficiency of beta-galactosidase, with resulting abnormal storage of acidic lipid materials in cells of the central and peripheral nervous systems, but particularly in the nerve cells. Because PWDs are all rather closely related to one another and share a limited gene pool, PWDs who were GM1 storage disease carriers were able to be genetically identified, and the condition has now been almost entirely eliminated from the breed. All breeding stock should be tested for GM-1 storage disease or GM1 gangliosidoses, which is a fatal nerve disease that typically appears when a puppy is approximately six months of age. The affected puppy will show clinical signs of cerebellar dysfunction including ataxia, tremors, paresis, and seizures. The pet may also exhibit a change in temperament. Lesions of the retina and clouding of the cornea may occur.\n\n\n=== Juvenile dilated cardiomyopathy ===\n\nJuvenile dilated cardiomyopathy is a fatal condition caused by an autosomal recessive gene. Affected puppies die suddenly or with very little warning usually between the ages of six weeks to seven months old. The signs and symptoms include a 12- to 48-hour onset of loss of appetite, decreased energy level, vomiting, and difficulty breathing. Some pups have no physical signs or symptoms at all, may just collapse and die, or are found dead by the breeder or new owner. At this time, there is no known cure or treatment but there is a way to prevent producing puppies affected by juvenile dilated cardiomyopathy.Breeders now have a DNA gene based test, based on a cheek swab or a blood sample, which will determine if a dog is a carrier of the gene for juvenile dilated cardiomyopathy. All breeding animals can be tested to determine their status, thus avoiding the breeding of two carriers. A puppy from a sire or dam without the gene will not be affected with this fatal disease.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGun dog\nWorking dog\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPortuguese Water Dog at Curlie"}, {"id": 389, "name": "Posavac Hound", "country": "Croatia", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog389", "description": "The Posavac Hound (FCI No. 154) (Croatian: posavski goni\u010d) is a breed of dog, originating as a hunting dog of the scenthound type. Croatia is the home country for the breed. The name translates into English as the Scenthound From The Sava Valley, but is usually translated as the Posavac Hound.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Posavac Hound is a solidly built dog with a somewhat long body, close-fitting drop ears, a long tail, and a gentle expression. The breed has an ideal height around 50 cm (20 ins) at the withers. The short, flat coat is slightly longer on the belly and backs of legs (feathering). Coat colour is a reddish wheaten, marked with white.\n\n\n== History ==\nThere is no actual proof of great antiquity for this breed, although there is much fanciful conjecture. The type is very old, and the modern breed resembles images seen in frescoes as early as 1497. Writers cited as having mentioned the type include Bishop of \u0110akovo Petar Baki\u0107 in 1719 and the veterinarian Franjo Berti\u0107, also of \u0110akovo, in 1859. Hounds from the Sava Valley (Posavina, south-east of Zagreb) were sold as boskini in Croatia in the 1800s. The ancestry of the dogs was documented starting in 1929, when registrations for the stud book were first taken. The breed was internationally recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1955, and the name was clarified in 1969. The breed has been known since then as the Posavac Hound. The breed is recognised in North America by the United Kennel Club in the Scenthound Group, and by a number of minor registries, hunting clubs, and internet-based dog registry businesses, and is promoted as a rare breed for those seeking a unique pet.\n\n\n== Health and temperament ==\nNo unusual diseases or claims of extraordinary health have been documented for this breed. The breed standard describes the ideal temperament as docile and an enthusiastic hunter.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIstrian Shorthaired Hound (FCI No. 151)\nIstrian Coarse-haired Hound (FCI No. 152)\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 390, "name": "Pra\u017esk\u00fd Krysa\u0159\u00edk", "country": "Czech Republic", "type": "", "picture": "dog390", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 391, "name": "Pudelpointer", "country": "Germany", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog391", "description": "The Pudelpointer is a versatile hunting dog breed from Germany. It is a pointing breed that came from a cross between the German hunting poodle (pudel) and the English Pointer.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe breed weighs between 44 and 66 lb (20 and 30 kg), stands 21 to 26 in (53 to 66 cm) at the shoulder, and comes in liver, chestnut, and occasionally black coats. The ideal coat is harsh, wiry, and dense. The dogs shed very little.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1881, a German breeder, Baron von Zedlitz, worked on producing his ideal tracking, pointing, and retrieving gun dog, suitable for work on both land and water. From seven specific Poodles and nearly 100 different pointers, he developed the Pudelpointer. The original sire was Tell, an English Pointer belonging to Kaiser Frederick III and the original dam was a German hunting pudel named Molly who was owned by Hegewald, an author known for works on hunting dogs.\nThe goal was to produce a dog that was willing and easy to train, intelligent, and loved water and retrieving, like the poodle, and add to that a great desire to hunt, a strong pointing instinct, and an excellent nose, like in the English Pointer, as well as being an excellent companion in the home.\nThe Poodle breed had much stronger genes, and so many more Pointers were used to achieve the balanced hunting dog that was desired. A mix of 11 Pudels and 80 Pointers were used during the first 30 years to achieve the desired traits and results.\nThe breed was introduced to North America in 1956 by Bodo Winterhelt, who to this day, remains very involved in maintaining the breed standard. His Winterhelle Kennel was the foundation of the breed in North America. In 1977 Winterhelt founded the Pudelpointer Club of North America in Canada.\nIn Germany as well as North America, its performance standards are its most important trait. Before being approved for breeding, dogs and bitches must pass Hunt Test with minimum scores of their performance tests of its field, tracking, and water skills set by the various breed clubs. These clubs are the Verein Pudelpointer in Germany and the following clubs in North America: NAPPA, PCNA and VPP-GNA).  The North American Versatile Hunting Dog Association (NAVHDA) also tests pudelpointers and other breeds of versatile hunting dogs.  \nThe pudelpointer never became a popularized breed in the United States in part because breeders have actively avoided recognition by the American Kennel Club.  Breeders believe that AKC recognition would place too much emphasis on form over function, possibly splitting the breed into a show breed and separate working class.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website of the North American Pudelpointer Breeders Association \nOfficial website of the Pudelpointer Breed Club (Verein Pudelpointer)\nOfficial website for the Pudelpointer Club of North America\nNorth American Chapter of the Verein Pudelpointer\nNorth American Versatile Hunting Dog Association (NAVHDA)"}, {"id": 392, "name": "Pug", "country": "China", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog392", "description": "The pug is a breed of dog with physically distinctive features of a wrinkly, short-muzzled face, and curled tail. The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colours, most often fawn or black, and a compact square body with well-developed muscles.\nPugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in Western Europe by the House of Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart. In the United Kingdom, in the nineteenth century, Queen Victoria developed a passion for pugs which she passed on to other members of the Royal family.\nPugs are known for being sociable and gentle companion dogs. The American Kennel Club describes the breed's personality as \"even-tempered and charming\". Pugs remain popular into the twenty-first century, with some famous celebrity owners. A pug was judged Best in Show at the World Dog Show in 2004.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Physical characteristics ===\nWhile the pugs that are depicted in eighteenth century prints tend to be long and lean, modern breed preferences are for a square cobby body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle. Their smooth and glossy coats can be fawn, apricot fawn, silver fawn, or black. The markings are clearly defined, and there is a trace of a black line extending from the occiput to the tail. The tail normally curls tightly over the hip.Pugs have two distinct shapes for their ears, \"rose\" and \"button\". \"Rose\" ears are smaller than the standard style of \"button\" ears, and are folded with the front edge against the side of the head. Breeding preference goes to \"button\" style ears.Pugs' legs are strong, straight, of moderate length, and are set well under. Their shoulders are moderately laid back. Their ankles are strong, their feet are small, their toes are well split-up, and their nails are black. The lower teeth normally protrude further than their upper, resulting in an under-bite.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe breed is often described by the Latin phrase multum in parvo, or \"much in little\" or \"a lot of dog in a small space\", alluding to the Pug's remarkable and charming personality, despite its small size. Pugs are strong willed but rarely aggressive, and are suitable for families with children. The majority of the breed is very fond of children and sturdy enough to properly play with them. Depending on their owner's mood, they can be quiet and docile but also vivacious and teasing. Pugs tend to be intuitive and sensitive to the moods of their owners and are usually eager to please them. Pugs are playful and thrive on human companionship. They also tend to have a snoozy nature and spend a lot of time napping. Pugs are often called \"shadows\" because they follow their owners around and like to stay close to the action, craving attention and affection from their owners.\n\n\n=== Birth and reproduction ===\nA Pug will be pregnant for an average of 63 days. The average sized litter for Pugs is 4 to 6 puppies, though this can vary from 1 to 9 and still be considered normal.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Chinese origins ===\nIn ancient times, Pugs were bred to be companions for ruling families in China. The pet Pugs were highly valued by Chinese Emperors, and the royal dogs were kept in luxury and guarded by soldiers. Pugs later spread to other parts of Asia. In Tibet, Buddhist monks kept Pugs as pets in their monasteries. The breed has retained its affectionate devotion to its owners since ancient times.The early history of the Pug breed has not been recorded in great detail; however, it is widely believed that the breed came from the Orient. China is the earliest known source for the breed. Similar dogs were popular in the Imperial court during the Song Dynasty.\n\n\n=== 16th and 17th centuries ===\nPugs were popular at European courts, and reportedly become the official dog of the House of Orange in 1572 after a Pug named Pompey saved the life of the Prince of Orange by alerting him to the approach of assassins.A Pug travelled with William III and Mary II when they left the Netherlands to accept the throne of England in 1688. During this period, the Pug may have been bred with the old type King Charles spaniel, giving the modern King Charles Spaniel its Pug characteristics.The breed eventually became popular in other European countries as well. Pugs were painted by Goya in Spain, and in Italy they rode up front on private carriages, dressed in jackets and pantaloons that matched those of the coachman. They were used by the military to track animals and people, and were also employed as guard dogs.\n\n\n=== 18th century to present day ===\nThe English painter William Hogarth was the devoted owner of a series of Pugs. His 1745 self-portrait, which is now in London's Tate Gallery, includes his Pug, Trump. The Pug was also well known in Italy. In 1789, a Mrs. Piozzi wrote in her journal, \"The little Pug dog or Dutch mastiff has quitted London for Padua, I perceive. Every carriage I meet here has a Pug in it.\" The popularity of the Pug continued to spread in France during the eighteenth century. Before her marriage to Napoleon Bonaparte, Jos\u00e9phine had her Pug Fortune carry concealed messages to her family while she was confined at Les Carmes prison, it having alone been given visiting rights.In nineteenth century England, the breed flourished under the patronage of Queen Victoria. Her many Pugs, which she bred herself, included Olga, Pedro, Minka, Fatima and Venus. Her involvement with dogs in general helped to establish the Kennel Club, which was formed in 1873. Queen Victoria favoured apricot and fawn colours. Queen Victoria's passion for Pugs was passed on to many other members of the Royal family, including her grandson King George V and his son King Edward VIII. Many responded to the breed's image of anti-functionalism and diminutive size during this period.In paintings and engravings of the 18th and 19th centuries, Pugs usually appear with longer legs and noses than today, and sometimes with cropped ears. The modern Pug's appearance probably changed after 1860 when a new wave of Pugs were imported directly from China. These Pugs had shorter legs and the modern-style Pug nose. The British aristocrat Lady Brassey is credited with making black Pugs fashionable after she brought some back from China in 1886. Ear cropping was made illegal in 1895.Pugs arrived in the United States during the nineteenth century and were soon making their way into the family home and the show ring. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1885. The Pug Dog Club of America was founded in 1931 and was recognised by the American Kennel Club that same year. In 1981, the Pug Dhandys Favorite Woodchuck won the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in the United States, the only Pug to have won there since the show began in 1877. The World Champion, or Best in Show at the 2004 World Dog Show held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was a Pug named Double D Cinoblu's Masterpiece.\n\n\n== Health problems ==\nSince Pugs lack longer snouts and prominent skeletal brow ridges, they are susceptible to eye injuries such as proptosis, scratched corneas, and painful entropion. They also have compact breathing passageways, leaving many prone to breathing difficulties or unable to efficiently regulate their temperature through evaporation from the tongue by panting. A Pug's normal body temperature is between 101 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) and 102 \u00b0F (39 \u00b0C). If this temperature rises to 105 \u00b0F (41 \u00b0C), oxygen demand is greatly increased and immediate cooling is required. If body temperature reaches 108 \u00b0F (42 \u00b0C), organ failure can occur. Their breathing problems can be worsened by the stresses of travelling in air cargo, which may involve high temperatures. Following the deaths of Pugs and other brachycephalic breeds, several airlines either banned their transport in cargo or enacted seasonal restrictions.Pugs that live a mostly sedentary life can be prone to obesity, though this is avoidable with regular exercise and a healthy diet. The median life span of Pugs is 11 years, which is in line with other breeds of the same size.\n\n\n=== Common conditions ===\n\nPugs, like other short-snouted breeds, have elongated palates. When excited, they are prone to \"reverse sneezing\" which causes them to quickly (and seemingly laboriously) gasp and snort. The veterinary name for this is pharyngeal gag reflex and it is caused by fluid or debris getting caught under the palate and irritating the throat or limiting breathing. Reverse sneezing episodes are usually not harmful, and massaging the dog's throat or covering its nose in order to make it breathe through its mouth can often shorten a sneezing fit.Some pugs are also born with stenotic nares which can also inhibit their breathing. In serious cases, the pinched nostrils make breathing even more difficult for this breed and put added pressure on the larynx. In some cases, the dog could pass out from blocked airways. If this happens, one should inquire with their veterinarian whether or not surgery is needed to modify the breathing passages.Eye prolapse is a common problem among Pugs and other brachycephalic breeds (see brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome) and can be caused by a trauma to the head or neck, or even by the owner using a tight leash instead of a harness.  While the eye can usually be pushed back into its socket by the owner or by a vet, veterinary attention is usually advisable. If the prolapse happens on a regular basis, the Pug might require surgery.Pugs have many wrinkles in their faces, so owners will often clean inside the creases to avoid irritation and infection. If this is not done, the dog may develop a condition known as skin fold dermatitis.An abnormal formation of the hip socket, known as hip dysplasia, affected nearly 64% of Pugs in a survey performed by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals; the breed was ranked the second worst-affected by this condition out of 157 breeds tested.Pugs are one of several breeds that are more susceptible than other dogs to demodectic mange, also known as \"demodex\". This condition is caused when parasitic mites, that are often present in a dog's skin without causing symptoms, are allowed to do damage because their host has a weakened immune system. It is a problem for many young Pugs, although not usually a major one, and is easily treatable, but some are especially susceptible and present with a systemic form of the condition. This vulnerability is thought to be genetic and breeders will avoid producing puppies from adults who have this condition.In 2008, an investigative documentary carried out by the BBC found significant inbreeding between pedigree dogs, with a study by Imperial College, London, showing that the 10,000 Pugs in the UK are so inbred that their gene pool is the equivalent of only 50 individuals.\n\n\n=== Serious issues ===\nPugs can suffer from necrotizing meningoencephalitis (NME), also known as Pug dog encephalitis (PDE), an inflammation of the brain and meninges. NME also occurs in other small dogs, such as the Yorkshire Terrier, Maltese, and Chihuahua. There is no known cure for NME, which is believed to be an inherited disease. Dogs usually die or have to be put to sleep within a few months of onset, which, in those susceptible to this condition, is mostly between six months and three years of age.This breed, along with other brachycephalic dogs (e.g., boxers, bulldogs), are also prone to hemivertebrae. The curled tail of a British bulldog is an example of a hemivertebrae, but when it occurs not in the coccygeal vertebrae but in other areas of the spine, it can cause paralysis. The condition occurs when two parts of a spinal vertebra do not fuse properly while a young Pug is still growing, resulting in an irregularly shaped spinal cavity which can put pressure on the spinal cord.\n\n\n== Historical depictions of pugs ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe breed became iconic in India, as it was featured as the mascot in a series of Vodafone (formerly Hutchison Essar) advertising commercials directed by Prakash Varma. The pug that was predominantly featured in the commercials was Cheeka. The advertisement campaign was followed by a rise in the popularity of pugs in India, and the sale of pugs more than doubled within months, with prices for pugs rising considerably. A few other adverts also appeared in the following months, inspired by the idea of a dog following a boy.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMolosser\nCompanion dog\nLap dog\nOrder of the Pug\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPugs at Curlie"}, {"id": 393, "name": "Puli", "country": "Hungary", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog393", "description": "The Puli is a small-medium breed of Hungarian herding and livestock guarding dog known for its long, corded coat.

The white Pulis are not albino, nor do they have blue eyes. They commonly have dark pigment, black pads, black noses and black pigment inside the mouth. The white gene is recessive to the pure black gene. The breed standard for females is about 16.5 inches (42 cm) at the withers and 17 inches for males.  Females weigh 23-25 pounds and males slightly more. The coat of some Puli dogs can be different with either thinner or thicker cords which can be flat or round depending on the texture of the coat and the balance of undercoat to outer coat.The coat is the result of a controlled matting process. Thin, rope-like corded coats are desired and the grooming should control the coat towards the forming of thinner ropes. The Puli's coat needs considerable grooming to keep its cords clean, neat, and attractive. With age, the coat can become quite long even reaching the ground. Alternatively, the coat can be trimmed short regularly for easy maintenance although the corded coat is what attracts many people to the breed. Contrary to some beliefs, the coat of a healthy puli will grow out again after trimming. This breed has little to no shedding.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Puli is an intelligent and active dog. It needs obedience training while still young. If a Puli gets enough exercise, it can live in the city,\nbut they do best when not kept indoor pets in small living spaces. Pulis kept indoors need a lot of exercise to use up their energy, or they can become either shy or overactive. They need to get the kind of exercise they were created for.  A Puli without enough exercise can become mischievous and cause trouble. The right kind of exercise includes running, running with a biker, hiking, jogging and field work; not just a walk around the corner. Pulis are best kept in a house with a garden. Cozy and very friendly especially towards children, they are sensitive and prone to resentment.\n\n\n=== Activities ===\n\nPulis are intelligent, agile dogs. Despite their bulky appearance and very thick coat, they are very fast, agile, and able to change directions instantly and are obedient enough to train for athletic competition. They are devoted and form close bonds with their owners.The breed is intelligent and can do well in obedience training if begun early. Traditionally, the Puli dog breed was used as a herding dog and sometimes even as a livestock guarding dog, as well. They make very good guard dogs, since they are very protective of their masters and territory. The Puli is sensitive, fun-loving, courageous, but also, at times, tough and headstrong.They are loyal to their owners and wary of strangers. They are highly active and keep a playful, puppy-like behavior their entire lives. They need a lot of exercise and free space, preferably outdoors. They can be trained and housebroken, but Pulis are generally not very well suited as city or indoor pets. When restricted to closed spaces for long periods of times, they grow restless and may develop unwanted personality traits, such as becoming hyperactive or, instead, increasingly aloof and lazy.\nAs a working dog, the Puli is very obedient, focused and determined when assigned a task. Some of them are used as police dogs. As a livestock guarding dog, they are fiercely protective of their territory and flock, and, despite their relatively small size, will fearlessly try to scare and drive any intruder away, however, they very rarely inflict any real injuries.\nAs a family dog, they make good security dogs and faithful family guardians. They can be very friendly and playful, even in old age. They regard their family as their flock, and will keep their distance until they are sure a stranger is not a threat. When annoyed, they may attack without warning, so a considerable distance may be advisable for strangers. They can be extremely independent and obstinate, and only accept strong-willed individuals as master.Pulis can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, Rally obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Pulis exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n=== Training ===\nPulis are valued for their energy and determination which is a result of their sheepdog history. Every Puli is a natural shepherd and instinctively knows how to herd a flock of sheep or livestock even if they have been raised as a family dog and have never been trained to do it. It is advisable to start training the Puli early in age, especially in obedience. They are very independent, strong-willed, and difficult to train in adulthood.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Puli is an ancient sheepdog from Hungary introduced by the migration of the Magyars from Central Asia more than 1,000 years ago. The Pulis were used for both herding and guarding livestock.\nThe Puli would commonly work together with the much larger, white Komondor, a Hungarian breed of (solely) livestock guardian dog. The Komondor is a large, solidly built dog, around 30 inches tall. The Komondor (or several Komondorok if there was a large amount of livestock) guarded the sheep or cattle mostly at night, while the Puli herded and guarded them during the day.\nWhen wolves or bears attacked the livestock, the Puli would alert the pack and the Komondorok would come and fight the intruders. Pulis can be good at fighting off wolves, because the thick coat protects their skin from being bitten. The Komondorok usually rested during daytime but at night walked around the flock, constantly moving, patrolling the area.\nNomadic shepherds of the Hungarian plains valued their herding dogs, paying as much as a year's salary for a Puli.\nIn Asia, the breed dates back 2,000 years and anecdotal evidence suggests that a Puli-like dog existed 6,000 years ago. Although the coats may look slightly similar, the Puli has never worked in water and the Puli's coat does not grow continuously in the same fashion as a corded Poodle's coat once the cords are formed. The ancestry of the Puli, however, is not known with certainty, as there are some references to ancient Rome.Possibly the Puli\u2019s ancestors are ancient Hungarian shepherd dogs. Travelers brought the Puli with them to the Carpathian basin, to help organize the flocks and herd the stallions of the area. Large Komondor or Kuvasz were used for guarding the flock. The Puli was also a suitable guard for flock protection but was primarily used for herding the animals. Around the beginning of the 20th century, a real turning point for the breed came when it was rediscovered but no longer used much as a sheepdog; extensive shepherding was replaced by intensive farming. The Puli\u2019s role was reduced in the life of the flock. Although their traditional duty was kept, they started to fulfill jobs that were convenient in the circumstances of their owner: they became house dogs. After World War II, the breed became a less popular pet; even now, the breed has not been able to regain the popularity it previously enjoyed.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture imported four purebred Pulik in 1935 to Beltsville, Maryland as part of an experiment when trying to help American agriculturists concerned with the problem of herding dogs which sometimes killed the animals to which they had been entrusted to control. The Pulik were bred among themselves and crossed with the German Shepherd, the Chow Chow and perhaps with two turkish sheepdogs which were quartered there at the time. On the tests given by researchers there, Pulik scored, on the average, between 75 and 85, where other herding breeds, scored in the range of 12 to 14. Because tests were inconclusive, they were never published. When WWII broke out, the Pulik were auctioned off to professional breeders, and, it is thought that, it is from these four dogs and their progeny that history of the Puli in the United States began.\n\n\n== Notable Pulik ==\nIn 1978, a Puli called Cinko Duda Csebi won the world exposition organized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale. The Mexican-born dog was owned by breeder Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez \u00c1valos.The dog known as \"The Auditor\" is assumed to be a Puli.  It lived in the contaminated Berkeley Pit copper mine in Butte, Montana. Notable for being one of the few things that could live and thrive in such a place, in time it became a sort of mascot for the town. After The Auditor died, several memorials were erected celebrating its existence.British grunge-rock band Bush, featured a picture of a leaping Puli in the booklet to their album Sixteen Stone. This particular Puli belonged to frontman Gavin Rossdale and was named Winston.\nLovey and Dude Romeo of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania have appeared extensively online and in YouTube videos Puli PrayingOriginally from Green Bay Wisconsin.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has a white Puli named Beast.In the 1960s, writer Harlan Ellison adopted a Puli named Ahbhu and wrote about him in the 1975 Hugo-winning novelette \"The Deathbird\" (part of the 1975 collection Deathbird Stories). In addition, Ahbhu appeared in the 1969 short story \"A Boy And His Dog\" as a predecessor to the main character's telepathic dog Blood.\nAmerican novelist T.C. Boyle used to own several Pulik and still has one. One of them, named \"Kutya\" (Hungarian for \"dog\"), is commemorated in his novel The Harder They Come.\n\n\n== Puli pictures ==\nWhite and black Pulik\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPuli at Curlie"}, {"id": 394, "name": "Pumi (dog)", "country": "Hungary", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog394", "description": "The Pumi (in Hungarian, the plural form is pumik) is a medium-small breed of sheep dog from Hungary.  They are versatile stock dogs equally adept at gathering, driving and keeping stock under control. They have a long head with semi-erect ears, a whimsical expression, and a tail that forms a circle over the back. The coat (black, white, grey, or fawn) is a combination of wavy and curly hair forming curls all over the body.\nThe Pumi is considered to have arisen from the cross-breeding of Hungarian Pulik with French and German herding dogs from the 17th century onwards.  The international breed standard was approved in 1935.  The Pumi became an officially recognised breed in the US in 2011 and in the UK in 2015.  There are over 2,000 Pumis registered in Hungary, with notable populations in Finland and Sweden and small but growing numbers of registrations in the US, UK and Germany.\nSome refer to the Pumi as the \"Hungarian herding terrier\" because it has some terrier-like attributes such as quick movement, alert temperament, and a quadratic, lean and muscular body type.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nPumis can be in varying shades of grey, white, or fawn (known as 'fako' in Hungary).  Grey Pumis are the most common, born black, and ranging from almost black to light grey in adulthood.  Puppies usually start greying at six to eight weeks old and the shade progressively lightens. The final shade is predicted by the colour of the parents. Other accepted colours are black, white, and cream to red with a darker mask, known as fawn with mask.  An analysis of 1023 Pumi puppies carried out in 2009 by the University of Debrecen found that 56% were born black turning grey, 14% were black, 13% white, 11% grey, and 4% are fawn-coloured. Brown, mottled or blue-merle-coloured puppies are born occasionally.The thick coat is curly and of medium length approximately 4-7 cm (1.5-3 inches) long and consisting of a harsh topcoat and soft undercoat, which provides good insulation and enables the dog to tolerate extremes of weather. The coat is maintained by combing every few weeks, and trimming every two to four months. The coat grows constantly (similar to that of the Poodle) and, if grooming is not maintained, it may start matting. The breed has little to no shedding. The Pumi is known for its alert and lively ears, which are high-set and carried semi-erect and with longer hair than the body.The Pumi is a square, light-bodied dog which looks somewhat larger because of its thick coat with a long, narrow head. The muzzle is 45% of the length of the head, which is of equal length to the neck. The stop is barely noticeable, and the skull is flat when seen from the side. The eyes are small, dark, and slightly oblique. Movements are lively and energetic as is the Pumi itself.Male Pumis stand 41 to 47 cm (16 to 19 in) at the withers and weigh 10 to 15 kg (22 to 33 lb); bitches are 38 to 44 cm (15 to 17 in) and weigh 8 to 13 kg (18 to 29 lb).\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe Pumi is lively, expressive, bold, a little suspicious of strangers, but never aggressive or overly shy, somewhat vocal and always ready for action. They can be very protective of their own families. Early socialisation is important.Pumis are intelligent and bark easily, but are easy to train. With the intelligence of a herding dog and the alertness of a terrier, this breed needs to be kept busy, for example with herding, agility and obedience training, flyball, jogging, or playing fetch. Pumis are good with children and other animals, as long as they are trained from an early age.  It retains a playful temperament into adulthood and this, together with its tufted ears, gives its Hungarian nickname, \"the clown\".A well-socialised Pumi with mental stimulation and physical activity should not have behavioural problems, but there are some natural behaviours that might become a problem if not managed properly include digging, barking, and a tendency to try to herd people. The Pumi was bred as a herding dog and it is still so used today working close to and driving livestock with its rapid movement, barking, and the occasional nip. It has  also acted as a guard dog barking at any strange person or animal. Consequently, it can be a vocal breed and dogs that are not engaged in farm work should be discouraged from barking unnecessarily.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name \"Pumi\" was first used in 1815. The name may have derived from \"Puli\"; the two names were used interchangeably for centuries, often depending on the region where the animal was from.  Alternatively, the name might have been derived from the German word \"pummel\" (\"puppy\") or from the word \"Pomeranian\", the origin of many German herding dogs used for cross-breeding. The most commonly accepted theory, from Otto Hermann, is that the name originated in \"pommern\", the short name of the Pomeranian Spitz. This was also accepted by Emil Raitsits in 1924.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe breed is closely related to the longer-haired Puli, an ancient sheepdog from Hungary that was introduced by the migration of the Magyars from Central Asia more than 1,000 years ago which can probably be traced back to Tibetan herding/guard dogs from China and Tibet.  The ancestral Hungarian herding dog appears to have been brought west during the migration from the Ural-Altay regions around 800 AD. The Pumi arose from later cross-breeding with French and German sheepdogs, such as the Spitz and Briard.The breed evolved spontaneously and was not the result of planned breeding. Pulis were cross-bred with German Pomeranians, French Briards, and several varieties of terriers during the 17th and 18th century.  In the 18th century, many Merino sheep were imported to Hungary, along with small Pyrenean Mountain Dogs that probably contributed to development of the Pumi producing dogs with a shorter and curlier coat. The first known drawing of a Pumi is from 1815.The breeding of pedigree dogs began on the initiative of Count Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi, founder of the Hungarian Academy of Science.  Within the Austro-Hungarian empire, during the later part of the 19th century, breeding of native Hungarian dogs was not encouraged. During the early twentieth century, Hungarians separated their herding dogs into the various breeds according to their phenotypes, and so the first distinction between Puli and Pumi was published in 1902.  The Puli was most common on the east Hungarian plains the Pumi in the hills of west Hungary with the Mudi common in southern Hungary. In the 1910s, controlled breeding began, but many large herds and their dogs were lost during the First World War, and the subsequent division of Hungary.Dr. Emil Raitsits who created the Pumi breed standard in 1921, referred to it as a \"sheepdog terrier\". Numbers rose between the wars with 130 of the dogs registered in 1924 when they were seen in the show ring and as working dogs. Raitsits was keen to preserve its typical terrier qualities. Before 1923, Pumis had been shown as local varieties of Pulis, but, by 1927, the two breeds had been officially separated. The Pumi standard was approved by the FCI in 1935 along with the scientific name Canis familiaris ovilis villosus terrarius-Raitsitsi. This had been proposed by Csaba Anghi to reflect the great deal of terrier in the Pumi both in its features and character. The early breed standards, focused on the differences between the related breeds noting for the Pumi with its distinctive features such as a longer muzzle, smoother stop line, upright folding ears, and its non-corded coat.During the Second World War, food shortages and lack of veterinary care reduced their numbers again and many dogs were shot by soldiers. Ria H\u00f6rter wrote that \"Ilona Orlay, one of Dr. Raitsits's assistants, walked through a burning Budapest pushing a chart [sic, ?cart] containing valuable Hungarian sheepdog papers, from the office of the Hungarian Kennel Club to a place of safety.\"Breeding became possible again in the period after the 1956 uprising. The 1960 breed standard, which remained current through to the 1980s, allowed any solid coat colour,, but the variations seen within the breed during the 1950s had since been reduced. It was first exported to Finland in 1973 and Sweden in 1985 and then to Italy and the Netherlands and the US in the early 1990s. The current international breed standard dates from September 2000. In 2016, the Hungarian government named the Pumi as one of its eight indigenous dog breeds, created a gene bank to preserve its characteristics, and announced support for breeding at the Hungarian national breeding centres.\n\n\n== Health ==\nPumis have a typical life expectancy of 12 to 14 years, but have been known to live to 19 years. Known medical issues are a knee problem called  patella luxation and canine hip dysplasia.  Responsible breeders have DNA testing performed for degenerative myelopathy and an eye disease called primary lens luxation, although neither is common. They also screen for patellar luxation and sometimes for elbow dysplasia.\n\n\n=== Hip Dysplasia ===\nHip dysplasia is an abnormal formation of the hip socket that can lead to serious joint problems for the dog.  It is a genetic trait also affected by environmental factors, and can be identified by X-Ray.  It is probably the most common health problem specific to the breed.  Tests on 93 Pumis in America found that about 9 per cent had abnormal hips.Health records of the breed from Finland and Sweden indicate that 80 per cent of the Pumis born there have healthy hips.\n\n\n=== Degenerative Myelopathy ===\nDegenerative myelopathy is an incurable, progressive disease of the canine spinal cord, found typically after the age of seven years.  Pumis can be carriers of the trigger gene.  DNA testing can identify those dogs that are carriers, and these should not be bred with other carriers.  Twenty per cent of 65 Pumis tested in the US were found to be carriers.\n\n\n=== Primary Lens Luxation ===\nPrimary Lens Luxation is a dislocation of the eye's lens.  This is also a genetic disease, for which the carrier gene can be identified by DNA testing.  Of 60 Pumis tested in the US, about 22 per cent were found to be carriers.\n\n\n=== Elbow Dysplasia ===\nElbow dysplasia involves developmental abnormalities of the elbow-joint, and the growth of cartilage or the structures surrounding it, leading to osteoarthritis. As of 2016, none of the Pumi tested in the UK have recorded abnormal scores.\n\n\n=== Testing ===\nAccording to the Hungarian Pumi Club of America, the tests that are recommended for the Pumi are:\nHip Dysplasia (X-ray)\nPatellar Luxation (veterinary certification)\nPrimary Lens Luxation (DNA test)\nDegenerative Myelopathy (DNA Test)\nEye examination by an ophthalmologist (optional)\nElbow Dysplasia (optional) (X-ray)\nDNA repository (optional) (blood sample)\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe Pumi was originally used as a herding dog and most working sheepdogs in Hungary are Pumis. However, today many are used for dog agility, dog dancing, and obedience. They also can be trained for detection, search and rescue, and other purposes. Since the Pumi was originally used for herding, they are eligible to compete in herding events; appropriate instinct and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive tests. Pumis that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in trials. Pumis have also been used for hunting wild boar.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nThe Pumi is little known outside Hungary where in 2015 there were 2,064 registered dogs.. The first Pumis were introduced into Finland in 1973, and Sweden and Finland have registered around 100 Pumis every year. In both countries, the Pumi is a popular agility dog seen in championship competitions, and also used for competitive obedience and dog dancing. At the end of 2014, there were about 881 Pumis registered in Finland, 74 in the Netherlands, 111 in Germany, 84 in the Czech Republic, 36 in France, 29 in the UK, 9 in Ireland, 10 in Ukraine, 10 in Estonia, 2 in Latvia, 5 in Slovenia, 1 in Spain and 5 in Japan.In 2004, the Pumi was accepted to the American Kennel Club Foundation Stock Service program and the Hungarian Pumi Club of America was founded. On 1 January 2011, the Pumi was accepted into the AKC Miscellaneous class having achieved 150 US registrations, and, on 1 July 2016, into the Herding group with over 300 registered dogs as the 190th dog breed that the Club had officially recognised.In the UK, the Kennel Club accepted the breed standard for the Pumi in 2015. There is an active breed club, and, as of December 2017, about 100 UK registrations.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 395, "name": "Pungsan Dog", "country": "North Korea", "type": "", "picture": "dog395", "description": "The Pungsan or Poongsan (Chosongul: \ud48d\uc0b0\uac1c; Hanja: \u8c50\u5c71\uac1c) is a breed of hunting dog from Korea. They were bred in the Kaema highlands of what is now North Korea. The dogs were traditionally hunting dogs.The dog is a rare breed, and is sometimes smuggled over the North Korea\u2013China border.During the 2000 inter-Korean summit, North Korean leader Kim Jong-il made a gift of two Pungsan dogs (associated with the North) to South Korean president Kim Dae-jung. In return, Kim Dae-jung gave two Jindo dogs (associated with the South) to Kim Jong-il. Born at the Pyongyang Central Zoo, the Pungsan dogs were originally named Dangyol (Unity) and Jaju (Independence), but were later renamed Uri (meaning We) and Duri (Two). They initially lived in the Blue House, the residence of the South Korean president, before being moved to the Seoul Zoo, where they gave birth to 15 puppies before both dying at age 13. During their lives, the dogs were accorded special status as guests of the state.At their Pyongyang summit in 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un gave two Pungsan dogs to South Korean President Moon Jae-in. The male was named Songkang, and the female was named Gomi. Gomi gave birth to six puppies within two months afterwards, leading Moon to remark that she must have been pregnant when she was given to him.

It should not be confused with the Pyrenean Mountain Dog.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Pyrenean Mastiff is a very large dog, males  77 centimetres (30 in) and females  71 centimetres (28 in) at the withers, although they can be up to  81 centimetres (32 in). They have a heavy white coat with large darker spots. The average weight is about  81 kilograms (179 lb), although males can often weigh over  100 kilograms (220 lb).\n\n\n== History ==\nFor a long time the Pyrenean Mastiff accompanied the herds of sheep in its migratory paths from the Aragonese and Navarrese Pyrenees until Maestrazgo. Its main function was to guard and protect the herds and its masters from the attacks of wolves, bears and thieves.\nDuring the 20th century, especially after the Spanish Civil War, due to economic difficulties, the mastiff went into decline as it was very expensive to keep a dog of its size. In the 1970s a group of fans started a job of recovery of the breed through the few specimens that were in the countryside and still had typical features of the ancient mastiff.  It has been documented since 1977 as a modern purebred breed by the Club del Mast\u00edn del Pirineo de Espa\u00f1a in Spain.The mountain dog breed is now being taken from its native region and promoted as a pet in other countries like USA by the Pyrenean Mastiffs USA Club. It was recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1982. The Pyrenean Mastiffs USA Club is actively working on AKC recognition within the United States.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThis strong, rustic breed is self-reliant and calm. It is even-tempered and docile at home and is protective with children. It is gentle with other dogs as well as other pets and people it knows. However, if challenged, the Pyrenean Mastiff will not hesitate to defend its family or itself from a perceived threat. Although it is gentle and kind with a loving temperament, it takes its work seriously and needs a strong, experienced leader. Certainly this large breed should be socialized from puppyhood to encourage confidence, but it will always be in its nature to remain suspicious of strangers.\nThe Pyrenean Mastiff should be trained with reward-based, positive lessons from as early an age as possible. This teaches it to pay attention to people. It is generally an independent-minded dog, and may not respect the owner if the owner is too passive.\n\n\n== Grooming ==\nThe Pyrenean Mastiff's longish coat needs regular brushing and combing. It is a regular shedder, too, so the more frequently it is brushed, the less shedding there will be. Its ears should be kept clean and dry, as should the areas around its eyes.\n\n\n== Exercise ==\nThe Pyrenean Mastiff does not require a great deal of exercise, but it will become bored and restless without a sufficient amount. Several daily walks will give it the opportunity it needs to check its surroundings and get exercise. Outings are also a great way to socialize the Pyrenean Mastiff, who becomes gentler and more trusting with every friend it makes along the way.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPerenean Mastiff at Open Directory Project"}, {"id": 397, "name": "Pyrenean Shepherd", "country": "France", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog397", "description": "The Pyrenean Shepherd (known in France originally, and also in non-AKC registries such as the UKC, as the Berger des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, and in Spain as the Pastor de los Pirineos) is a medium-small breed of dog native to the Pyrenees mountains in southern France and northern  Spain, bred since at least medieval times for herding livestock, especially sheep.  It worked as an active herder together with the Great Pyrenees, another mountain dog, which acted as the flock's guardian.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Pyrenean Shepherd is the smallest of the French and Spanish herding dogs.  The breed comes in two varieties: Rough-faced (Poil Long) and smooth-Faced (Face Rase). Rough-faced males are 15 1\u20442 to 18 1\u20442 inches (39 to 47 cm) at the withers, and rough-faced females are 15 to 18 inches (38 to 46 cm). Smooth-faced males are 15 1\u20442 to 21 inches (39 to 53 cm) at the withers, and smooth-faced females are 15 1\u20442 to 20 1\u20442 inches (39 to 52 cm) inches at the withers.  The weight is between 15\u201332 pounds (7\u201315 kg), aiming for lithe and muscular, never fat.The head is of small proportions in comparison to the dog, with a rather flat skull, and a somewhat short, triangular muzzle. The face is expressive and intelligent, with dark eyes, except in the case of merles or slate grey coat colour. Traditionally the dog's ears are cropped.  If natural, the Pyrenean Shepherd should have semi-prick or rose ears. Naturally prick ears are not correct for the breed, and may indicate an outcross.The body is long and lean, and should reflect the natural energetic athleticism of the dog. The legs are well proportioned, with lean, well-angulated, well-let-down hocks typical of a sure-footed mountain breed. The tail can be docked short, a natural bob-tail, or naturally long with a crook in the end, so long as its carried below the topline at rest and in motion.\n\n\n==== Coat ====\nThe coat has two basic varieties, smooth-faced and rough-faced (demi-long or long-haired). The smooth-faced variety has short, fine hairs on the muzzle, with a modest ruff around the face and neck, and some feathering along the legs, tail, and belly. In contrast, the rough-faced has longer hair on the muzzle and face, though never enough to cover or obscure the eyes or create a bearded effect, and demi-long or long, coarse hair over the rest of the body. The rough-faced dog can also form cords over his hindquarters and front legs.\n\n\n==== Color ====\nShades of fawn are most typical for the breed, either with or without black mask and overlay. Also very common are brindles and various shades of grey. Less common are merles of various kinds (blue merle, brindle merle, fawn merle), and black. All colors allow for some white at the head, chest, and feet, but solid colors are preferred.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe Pyrenean Shepherd was designed to be a sheepdog, and as such is full of the same sort of energy that other herding dogs have, but in a surprisingly small package. This adaptive dog wants to, and can, do all the jobs on the field, and is a natural herder. A dog that needs a job, its cleverness makes it ideal for other work and dog sports such as flyball, competitive obedience, and agility. This dog is good with, and protective of, children with whom they were brought up.Pyr Sheps are \"one-man\" dogs, attached and dedicated to their owners, with a desire to follow them around the house to help with daily chores. They sense every mood and often seem to be able to read their masters' minds, as they are constantly watchful. Because of this, they are extremely trainable.Their natural wariness, while valuable in a herding dog which might need to alert their shepherd of strange animals or people, combined with their herding bossiness, can lead to shyness or aggression in even the most friendly puppy if not properly managed. Frequent socialization from a very young age can help counter this trait.\n\n\n=== Activities ===\nPyrenean Shepherds can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, and tracking events.On 1 January 2009, the Pyrenean Shepherd finally became eligible to compete in herding events in the United States sponsored by the AKC. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Pyr Sheps exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== Care ==\nPyrenean Shepherds need only a weekly brush, as well as regular checks for burrs or mats, to keep their coat in good condition. They also need a lot of space indoors, and space to exercise outdoors.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSome specialists argue that the Pyrenean Shepherd was there long before the arrival of the Roman armies which dominated Gaul and Hispania and this was mixed with large molossers that the Romans had in their army. Other theories suggest that its origin is linked to the passage of the Vandals and Suebi through the Pyrenees to the south.After the first World War, the Pyrenean Shepherd, or \"Pyr Shep\", gained national recognition in France for their valiant work as couriers, search and rescue dogs, watch dogs, and company mascots.The smooth-faced Pyrenean Shepherd in its harlequin or blue merle coloration may have been one of the foundation breeds for the Australian Shepherd when sheep herders brought their sheepdogs to the American West when they flew to the United States as contract herders for the Western Range Association in the 1940s until the early 1970s.The Pyr Shep is not yet a well-known breed outside of its native France and Spain, but its size, intelligence, and attractive coat make it appealing. After one of its breed won the World Agility Championship for midsized dogs in 2003, it gained more attention as an intelligent performance dog for dog sports.On 24 January 2015, a male Pyrenean Shepherd, GCh (Grand Champion) La Brise Sun Bear, a dog (i.e., male), was awarded an AKC all-breed Best In Show (BIS). This was the first (and so far only) BIS since having been formally recognized by the AKC for competition (within the Herding Group) effective as of 1 January 2009 (6 years previously).The first Pyrenean Sheepdogs were registered with the Kennel Club (UK) in 1988 and the Pyrenean Sheepdog Club of Great Britain was formed in 1992 by a small number of enthusiasts.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPyrenean Shepherd at Curlie"}, {"id": 398, "name": "Rafeiro do Alentejo", "country": "Portugal", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog398", "description": "The Rafeiro do Alentejo or Alentejo Mastiff, also called the Portuguese Mastiff, is a large breed of dog that originated in Portugal. The Rafeiro do Alentejo is of the livestock guardian dog type, and the name refers to its area of origin, Alentejo, in south-central Portugal. Although the word rafeiro means mongrel in Portuguese, the Rafeiro do Alentejo is recognized as a breed by the Portuguese Caniculture Club and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Rafeiro is a very large mountain dog, averaging 47.5 kg (104.5 lb) and 73 cm (28.7 in) at the withers. The head is described as bear-like. Eyes should be dark, never yellow. The ears are set medium high and fold downwards. The dog has a deep chest, and should have a general aspect of length (not whippety, the standard says.)\nThe fur is short to medium, the same length all over, and can be black, yellow, and fawn (a light brown colour) with white markings, or white with other colours. The coat can be streaked or brindled or dappled.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe breed standard describes the breed as \"sober\" (meaning \"marked by seriousness, gravity, or solemnity of conduct\"), his movement as slow and rolling, and as having a calm expression. Individual dogs may vary in behaviour and temperament, and puppies must be well socialized.\nAs with all very large dogs, they are not the dogs for beginners. Dogs of this size and type have the potential to be a danger to others if not well socialized at an early age, and are recommended only for the experienced dog handler who has the time to socialize and train the dog. They mature slowly, are very independent, and often does not respond to traditional force methods of dog obedience training. They are extremely territorial and will protect the sheep, households, and families they feel were placed under their protection. They are not aggressive but protective and are said to get along quite well with children.\n\n\n== History ==\nRafeiro do Alentejo are of the very ancient molosser type that migrated with humans from Central Asia. When the dogs arrived in the Iberian Peninsula is not known; they may have come with nomads sometime in prehistory, or have been brought by the Romans when they ruled the area thousands of years ago. It is often supposed that the breed is related to the Tibetan Mastiff, but no proof of this exists.\nWhat is known is that this breed and the ancient types from which it descended have been used to move sheep from mountains in northern Portugal to the plateau of Alentejo and back to the mountain. Due to changes in agriculture and livestock raising, and the elimination of large predators, the breed ceased to have economic use and began to decline. Fanciers, however, have been able to keep the breed alive, although, in Portugal, it is still considered \"vulnerable\". Today the Rafeiro do Alentejo is most often kept as a companion and guard dog.\nThe Rafeiro do Alentejo (Alentejo Mastiff) is recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in Group 2, Section 2.2 Mastiffs, Mountain Type, Portugal (breed number 96). Other Portuguese breeds in Section 2.2 include the C\u00e3o da Serra da Estrela (number 173) and the C\u00e3o de Castro Laboreiro, number 150. The Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Dos Criadores Do Rafeiro Do Alentejo is the official breed club for the Rafeiro do Alentejo in Portugal. Rafeiro do Alentejo are now included in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club (as the Rafeiro do Alentejo) and fully recognised by the United Kennel Club in the United States, in the Guardian Dog Group (as the Alentejo Mastiff). It may also be sold by commercial breeders under the Rafeiro do Alentejo name or any of the various translations and English versions of the name, with registration by minor kennel clubs that require little to no breed verification for registration, or listed by internet-based dog registry businesses where it is promoted as a rare breed for those seeking a unique pet.\n\n\n== Health ==\nLittle data exists for health problems in this breed. However, when bred to be very oversized, they may be subject to hip dysplasia, and dogs with deep chests sometimes suffer from bloat.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPastoralism\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHancock, David (August 31, 2014).

It was the companion of the royalty and aristocracy in Southern India, particularly in its namesake town of Rajapalayam in the Virudhunagar district of Tamil Nadu.\nFour commemorative postage stamps were issued on 9 January 2005 by India Post for four breeds (sic.) i.e. Himalayan Sheepdog, Rampur Hound, Mudhol Hound (Face value Rs. 5.00 each) and Rajapalayam (Face value Rs. 15.00).\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nIt is a large dog, usually measuring about 65\u201375 cm (25\u201330 inches) at the withers. It is a hound, and therefore should be kept in optimum working condition. It tends to be heavier boned than most sighthounds, but shares the depth of chest and basic body structure.\nIts facial structure is considerably different from that of a Caravan Hound, as it is meant primarily for hunting wild boar. The tail has a slight curl.\n\nThe most prized colour is milk white, with a pink nose and golden eye. In the past, puppies of colour were usually culled from the litters since the owners preferred the pure white dogs. The coat is short and fine. An extremely handsome and graceful dog, the Rajapalayam has a gait similar to the trotting of a thoroughbred horse. As with many fully white dogs, there is a high incidence of deafness in this breed. Puppies born with whitish or blue eyes are deaf. Many Rajapalayam dogs suffer from mange, though this is usually not a serious problem. Though the breed dates back a few centuries, the creators of the breed unwittingly ended up fashioning an albino dog, characterized by the pink nose and the lack of pigmentation.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Rajapalayam was used predominantly for hunting wild boar and as a formidable guard dog.They are sight hounds by nature but it was proved that by a little training they can be also a Scent hound. All depends on the trainer. It needs wide open spaces and is very affectionate and devoted towards its owner, although not always demonstrative. They do not usually like to be touched or handled by strangers and are known to be one-person dogs. Rajapalayams are largely aggressive and hostile towards strangers, and will attack intruders. Socialization in puppyhood is important. They usually do not get along well with other pets like cats, owing to their strong hunting instincts.\n\n\n== History ==\nRajapalayam hounds were primarily bred and used by Nayakar dynasty of Tamil Nadu, it is speculated by some researchers that the Rajapalayam may have been one of the dogs used in the breeding of the modern Dalmatian. The Rajapalayam dog was used during the Carnatic Wars and Polygar War to attack the British cavalry in battle as Rajapalayams were very fast, strong and aggressive in attacking the opponents. It is also believed that 4 Rajapalayams once saved the life of their master fighting against a tiger and killing it bravely many years ago near a forest in Virudhunagar district of Tamil Nadu. They are largely used to guard the rice fields, houses and farms. In the last two decades Indian Army started using them as guard dogs to support the army in the borders of Kashmir.\n\n\n== Future of the breed ==\nThe pure Rajapalayam is more or less extinct, and only a few are to be found in isolated pockets around southern Tamil Nadu. The breed may vanish altogether if efforts are not initiated soon to revive it. A dog breeding unit was established at Saidapet, Chennai, during 1980\u201381. This unit primarily rears native breeds like the Rajapalayam, Combai, kanni, and Chippiparai. To create awareness and encourage dog lovers to rear native breeds, the Animal Husbandry Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu participates in dog shows. Localities have established a cooperative and interested families are given female dogs and expertise that is required for large-scale breeding. The Indian Postal Department has brought out postage stamps on the Rajapalayam, as well as the Mudhol Hound, Rampur Hound, and the Himalayan Sheepdog. The Kennel Club of India has taken up the cause of the Rajapalayam.  With the club's cooperation, the \"Save the Rajapalayam Project\" has been launched. The project has greatly influenced the breed's population and is active under KCI.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRaja et al \"Phenotypic characterization of Rajapalayam dog of Southern India\" Indian Journal of Animal Sciences 87 (4): 447\u2013451, April 2017\nRaja, K.

The Rampur hound is a large member of the sighthound family. In North West of India it is often described as a smooth-haired sighthound that is substantially built. It was the favored hound of the Maharajahs for jackal control, but was also used to hunt lions, tigers, leopards, and panthers. It was considered a test of courage for a single hound to take down a golden jackal. The Rampur is built to cover great distances at high speed but is also capable of great endurance.\nFour commemorative postage stamps were issued on 9 January 2005 by India Post for four breeds (sic.) i.e. Himalayan Sheep Dog, Rampur Hound, Mudhol Hound (Face value Rs. 5.00 each) and Rajapalayam (Face value Rs. 15.00)\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe length from the withers to the base of the tail is about 36 inches, with a chest which is deep but not very wide across the shoulders, and with well-sprung ribs. The tail is long and tapering slightly curving upwards and carried low; it is about 24\"\u201327\" in length. The neck, about 12 inches in circumference, is long, arched, and muscular, and rather broad where it joins the body. The roughly 9-inch-long jaws are expected to exhibit a powerful scissor bite. The males measure 60\u201375 cm (24\u201330 in) in height. The females measure 55\u201360 cm (22\u201324 in) in height. They weigh about 27\u201330 kg (60\u201365 lb).\nThey are approximately the same height as most other greyhounds, but much wider and more muscular, somewhat similar to the Rhodesian Ridgeback. The head of the Rampur is broader and more substantial than the head of the English Greyhound. It has a flat skull and a pointed nose. It also has a characteristic roman bend. Their ears are high-set on their head and held in a rose or pendant fashion. The Rampur's foot is a large \"hare\" shape, with heavy webbing. Their toes are very articulated and flexible, even able to bend backwards a bit. They are not unlike our own fingers in many ways. This maneuverability helps to give them a cat-like balance, with most dogs able to walk on ledges or to calmly clear a six-foot fence. Colors include mouse-gray, grizzle, brindle, particolor or, rarely, black. The gray and grizzle colorings in particular have the ability to blend particularly well with forest foliage, capable of making the dogs difficult to spot from a distance of as little as ten feet, in broad daylight. Black, however, is the most sought-after color of dog by many enthusiasts. Their eye color ranges from yellow to golden-brown.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe breed loves human companionship, and like most sighthounds tends to keep itself clean and well-groomed. They may appear lazy but will charge if needed. The Rampur in play can be a scary thing to the uninitiated. They like to charge at each other at speed, then butt their chests with extensive force. They are affectionate to their owners, almost to a fault.  Even so, the Rampur Hound is still a commanding breed and makes an excellent guard-dog. Generally gentle and sensitive around its own family's children, the Rampur nonetheless tends to be a one-person dog, and has been known to display protective instincts. At times they can also be rambunctious and prone to knocking people over in their enthusiasm. They can sometimes be aggressive with other dogs.\nBefore obtaining a Rampur Hound, size and exercise requirements should be taken into consideration. Relatively robust, it needs plenty of space to stretch its legs and probably would be not be happy to be confined to a small apartment.\n\n\n== Health ==\nRampurs are typically a healthy and long-lived breed, living up to fifteen years, and hereditary illness is rare. What diseases are seen are usually similar to those seen in other greyhound breeds; Rampurs have been known to develop esophageal achalasia, gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), and osteosarcoma Because the Rampur's lean physique makes it ill-suited to sleeping on hard surfaces, owners should generally provide soft bedding; without bedding, Rampurs are prone to develop painful skin sores, though feeding them foods high in vitamin A may also help mitigate this.\nDue to Rampurs' unusual physiology and anatomy, a veterinarian with experience in the peculiarities of the breed is advisable, particularly when anaesthesia is required. If such specialists are not available, it is best to seek one who specialises in the treatment of greyhounds or related breeds.\nGreyhounds demonstrate unusual blood chemistry, which can be misread by veterinarians not familiar with the breed; this can result in an incorrect diagnosis. Rampurs have higher levels of red blood cells than do other breeds, (a trait inherited from their English Greyhound ancestors). Since red blood cells carry oxygen to the muscles, this higher level allows the hound to move larger quantities of oxygen faster from the lungs to the muscles. Veterinary blood services should use greyhounds as  blood donors if there are no available Rampurs, (Greyhounds are generally used as universal blood donors anyway).\n\n\n== Modern utilisation ==\nToday, with boar hunting no longer a state-sanctioned activity, it is restricted mainly to the rural population of India, and Rampurs have seen a resultant decline in popularity. Unlike the maharajahs of years past, today's rural Rampur owners tend to keep their working hunting dogs for food or to get rid of pests, rather than solely for companionship. Rampurs are now mainly kept for the hunting of jackals, but they are also still capable of tracking down and killing other, larger game that has been wounded by hunters. Their upkeep can prove prohibitively expensive for many of the rural poor, however. They have not caught on as a show dog, have never been exhibited in the conformation ring, and are by and large still an actively working breed, rather than a pet.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nHis Royal Highness Ahmad Ali Khan of Rampur, Nawab of Rampur State, bred these dogs by combining the blood lines of very powerful but ferocious T\u0101z\u012b, brought in by the Afghans, and the English Greyhound that was more obedient but less resistant to the varying climatic conditions. He gave the name 'Rampur Hound' to the dogs he bred. The Rampur Hound far exceeded his expectations. While it got its looks and stalwart character from its T\u0101z\u012b Afghan ancestors, from the English Greyhound it got its speed. Here was a dog that would seldom back down in confrontations, and could more or less keep up with the fastest prey.\nWith the fall from power of the Maharajahs in 1947, so too fell the popularity of the Rampur Hound. The effect of the arrival of the English was evident to the Rampur, as well as the native Indian people. Additional English greyhound was bred into some of the lines, making it very difficult to find a purebred Rampur Greyhound today. \nWith the decline in hunting in India the dog's popularity plummeted. It was no longer fashionable or practical for the rich to keep them, while the poorer population simply could not afford to keep one. In recent years, however, its popularity has begun to rise once more, and the breed's numbers along with this.\nNonetheless, this remarkable breed still balances on the edge of extinction. Only a handful are known and registered outside of India, with all current known individuals outside India being currently located in the U.S. state of New Jersey.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSighthound\nRajapalayam (dog)\nChippiparai\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20060713191426/http://www.thekci.org/home.aspx, The Kennel Club of India."}, {"id": 401, "name": "Rastreador Brasileiro", "country": "Brazil", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog401", "description": "The Rastreador Brasileiro (in English, Brazilian Tracker) is a large breed of dog from Brazil, first recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1967, but an outbreak of disease, compounded by an overdose of insecticide, wiped out the breed's entire breeding stock.  The FCI and the Brazilian Kennel Club (Confedera\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Cinofilia) then declared the breed extinct in 1973 and delisted it. Since then,  efforts have been made to re-create the breed. The Rastreador Brasileiro is a hunting dog of the scenthound type. The breed is also known by the names Urrador (for its hunting cry) or Urrador Americano, in reference to the American (U.S.) coonhounds in its background.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nA breed standard from 1970 shows the size as being 62 to 67 cm (24.4 to 26.4 ins) at the withers, and the general appearance as being generally similar to an American coonhound.\n\n\n== Re-creation ==\nThe Grupo de Apoio ao Resgate do Rastreador Brasileiro in Brazil, a club dedicated to the Brazilian restoration of the breed, lists as an objective the finding of forty breeding animals of the correct type that can be certified as members of the breed, so as to eventually be once again recognised by the Brazilian Kennel Club.Restoration of the breed is difficult due to the existence of very few dogs of the correct type and the lack of people interested in recovering the true Brazilian cultural and genetic heritage of the breed.

The breed is an agile dog with a lean and athletic build; the head is triangular with a semi-flat skull. The eyes are very dark and the Ratonero has a long muzzle, and high set ears that bend over at the tip. The tail is traditionally docked to one quarter of its length, however they may also be born with a natural bobtail.The coat is short and dense, which is typically white. Its facial markings are a mixture of brown, white and black markings (known as tricolor), usually with tan-colored eyebrows, and always with a black melanistic mask.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe breed is lively and brave with strong hunting instincts. It must also be friendly and according to the breed club this breed is good with children.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nEnglish wine merchants settling in the Sherry making region of Spain, Marco de Jerez, brought with them the ancestors of today's Fox Terrier breeds as long as several hundred years ago, where they were crossed with local dogs and used for vermin control of rats and mice in the wineries. In the 1900s, the Toy Terrier was crossed into the breed. In 1993, the first breed club, the Club Nacional del Perro Andaluz Ratonero Bodeguero, was formed, and a breed standard was written. In 2000 the breed was recognised as a native Spanish breed by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, although it is not yet recognised internationally by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale. The breed is recognised by numerous minor kennel clubs - such as the Nordic Kennel Union - and dog registries, especially in North America. As some of these groups require little to no verification before registering dogs as being of a certain breed, puppy buyers should research their dog's pedigree to make sure it is from Spain and not one of the many similar breeds of dogs derived from fox terriers.\n\n\n== Health ==\nNo diseases specific to this breed, or claims of extraordinary health, have been documented for the Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz, though an undescended testicle is not uncommon in male pups.\n\n\n== Similar breeds ==\nBreeds similar in appearance to (but not the same as) the Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz include the Jack Russell Terrier, the Parson Russell Terrier, and the Rat Terrier.

During that era it was known as Canis villaticus (\"Farm dog\") and Perro de huerta (\"Huerta dog\"). Huerta refers to the fertile cultivation area of the region. In the 18th century, the breed was called Perro de acequias (\"Dog of irrigation ditches\"), which referred to the fact it killed rats that were found in irrigation canals. It increased its popularity as a rat-catcher and a playmate of children. The local farmers used it both as a ratter and a companion, as well as a protector of the house. It caught rats and mice in stables, cellars and barns, but it was also used for rabbit and hare hunting.The instincts of the Murcian Ratter had developed during the modern age both through crossing and inbreeding. As the result, there was a dog who had both rat-catching instinct and agility and the small size of the ancient dogs that were imported from far away. According to one theory, the breed descends from crosses between imported terriers and local dogs. Another theory states that its ancestors might have been Carthaginian, Roman or Egyptian dogs brought to the area by sailors. It might have been crossed with the Fox Terrier during the 18th and 20th century, but it is more likely that it has been crossed with the English Toy Terrier or Manchester Terrier. These kinds of dogs were also used on boats and it is likely that English trademen have influenced on its arrival to the region.In the 18th century, the Murcian Ratter had developed into the form it is known today. In the late 19th and early 20th century, it was already very popular in the region. Breeding was very strict and breeders avoided crossing it with the German Pinscher and Chihuahua, as purity was much appreciated. As breeding was focused on certain families which were devoted to purity, this led to remarkable inbreeding. Due this, its characteristics became more homogenous. It became strong, agile and fast in its work.In the late 18th century and mid 19th century, the majority of the population was concentrated in the county of Huerta de Murcia. However, they were also popular in Vega Alta del Segura (Cieza, Abar\u00e1n), Alto Guadalent\u00edn, Bajo Guadalent\u00edn (Totana, Lorca, Alhama), Valle de Ricote (Archena, Villanueva del R\u00edo Segura, Ulea), R\u00edo Mula (Campos del R\u00edo, Mula, Albudeite), Noroeste (Calasparra, Caravaca de la Cruz, Ceheg\u00edn), Campo de Cartagena (Cartagena, Fuente \u00c1lamo) and Comarca del Mar.While the region and its economic activities developed, the numbers of the breed started to decrease. In the 20th century, it was already isolated to very small regions of Murcia. Its breeding was still continued in Bajo Guadalent\u00edn and Alto Guadalent\u00edn and the highest number of individuals was found in the municipality of Lorca. It was still appreciated in local factories and mills as an efficient ratter. In other municipalities of the region, it was used as a protector of rabbits.In 1935, Don Pedro Manzanera Cano started to rescue Ratoneros in Rambilla de San Lazaro area of Lorca. He received his first pair of dogs from the mill of Don Juan de Dios Vald\u00e9s and later he got one male and three females more from the same place. After receiving a male from La Rambla Mill, Manzanera started breeding program in the neighborhood of San Jose. His dogs spread also to the neighborhoods of San Juan, Santa Mar\u00eda, San Pedro etc. Manzanera used his dogs also for hunting rabbits and although the size of the dogs varied from 28 cm to 40 cm, the smaller size was more practical in this task.Today, the Murcian Ratter is more popular as a pet than a ratter or hunter. However, it is still nowadays used also as hunter and protector in several places in Murcia.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Murcian Ratter resembles the Miniature Pinscher and English Toy Terrier. The height of males is 35.25 cm and the height of females 32.79 cm. The males weight 6.18 kg and females 5.53 kg. The most common colors are tricolor and black-and-tan. Other colors include black, black with white markings, cinnamon, and cinnamon with white markings. Ears are erect and eyes either round or oval-shaped. The color of the eyes is either black or brown. The tail is either naturally stumpy or docked.\n\n\n== Health ==\nA typical characteristic of the breed is its longevity. For example, a female named Estrella has achieved the age of 23 years. Usually the average life expectancy is 14 years or more.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 404, "name": "Ratonero Valenciano", "country": "Spain", "type": "", "picture": "dog404", "description": "Gos Rater Valenci\u00e0 (English for: Valencian rat hunting dog) is a breed of dog that originates in Spain.

A Ratonero Valenciano named Kike de Ca Batiste won the National Dog Championship in Spain in November 2011, the first time the breed has done so.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAccording to the breed standard, the coat should be short, no longer than 2 centimetres (0.79 in) in length. The most common markings are tricolor, with the colors dominating the white portion of the coat. Other markings include black and tan, brown and white, and brown and tan. The standard conformation show size for these dogs are 30\u201340 centimetres (12\u201316 in) for males at the withers, and 29\u201338 centimetres (11\u201315 in) for females. The ideal size is listed as 36 centimetres (14 in) and 33 centimetres (13 in) respectively. Both sexes weight ranges are the same, ideally 4\u20138 kilograms (8.8\u201317.6 lb).The breed standard describes them as tailless dogs, and states that any tail should be cropped either \"without respecting any vertebra or just the first\".\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe dogs continue to be used in hunting, specifically for rabbits.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRatonero Bodeguero Andaluz\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSpanish National Breed Club\nReal Sociedad Canina de Espa\u00f1a Breed Standard"}, {"id": 405, "name": "Rat Terrier", "country": "United States", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog405", "description": "The Rat Terrier is an American dog breed with a background as a farm dog and hunting companion. Traditionally more of a type than a breed, they share much ancestry with the small hunting dogs known as feists. Common throughout family farms in the 1920s and 1930s, they are now recognized by the United and American Kennel Clubs and are considered a rare breed.  Today's Rat Terrier is an intelligent and active small dog that is kept both for pest control and as a family pet.\n\n\n== Info ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Rat Terrier ranges from about 10 to 25 pounds and stands 10 to 18 inches at the shoulder. The miniature size (13 inches and under as defined by the UKC) is becoming increasingly popular as a house pet and companion dog, but the miniature is still a hunting dog. The standard says \"small to medium\"  and the miniature is small enough to go in and under those places where vermin like to hide. A larger strain, often in excess of 25 pounds, has been developed. Called the Decker or Decker Giant, it was named after breeder Milton Decker, who created a larger hunting companion and are recognized by the National Rat Terrier Association (NRTA, see \"Breed recognition\" below). UKC and AKC do not recognize the Decker strain as another breed, they are merely considered a standard variety. The NRTA recognizes a Toy variety weighing 10 pounds or less. The NRTA continues to classify the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier as the Type B Rat Terrier. In the 1970s, a hairless mutation appeared in a single Rat Terrier and was propagated into a strain of the Rat Terrier.  After a period of development this line resulted in the American Hairless Terrier, recognized as a separate breed by several registries.\n\nThe Rat Terrier comes in a variety of coat colors. The classic coloring is black tanpoint with piebald spotting (known as black tricolor), but chocolate, tan (varying in shade from pale gold to dark mahogany), blue, isabella (pearl), lemon and apricot are all fairly common. They may be tricolor or bicolor, always with some amount of white present. Sable may overlay any of these colors. Creeping tan (often \"Calico\"), is also acceptable. Ticking is usually visible in the white parts of the coat, or in the underlying skin. Brindle, currently disallowed by the main breed standards, is considered by some to be a traditional Rat Terrier pattern, and there is a growing movement to have this pattern accepted into the breed. However, merle is widely considered to be the result of recent outcrosses and, because of associated health problems, is rejected by most Rat Terrier breeders. \nEar carriage is erect, but can also be tipped, or button, all of which contribute to an intelligent, alert expression. The tail has been traditionally docked to about 2\u20133 inches, but the bobtail gene is very common in Rat Terriers and can result in a variety of tail lengths. Today, some breeders prefer a natural, undocked tail, which is accepted in the breed standards.\nRat Terriers tend to be both intelligent and stubborn, knowing how to get what they want when they want it. They are also considered good family pets because of their high energy and compatibility with kids. They are very playful and they need lots of exercise.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe social sensitivity of Rat Terriers makes them very trainable and easier to live with for the average pet owner, but it also means that extensive socialization from an early age is critical. Proper socialization of a Rat Terrier puppy includes exposing the animal to a wide variety of people and places, particularly during the first three months of life. Like most active and intelligent breeds, Rat Terriers tend to be happier when they receive a great deal of mental stimulation and exercise. Rat terriers are loyal to their owners and are very respectful.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nDue to regular outcrossings throughout the Rat Terrier's history, overall it is a very hardy breed. However, with its growth in popularity in recent years some issues are becoming more common. The Canine Health Information Center (CHIC) recommends that Rat Terriers be tested for patellar luxation, cardiac abnormalities, pancreatic issues, hip dysplasia, and Legg\u2013Calv\u00e9\u2013Perthes syndrome.The average lifespan of a well-bred Rat Terrier is 16\u201319 years. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest known record of a rat-catching dog is that of \"Hatch\", whose remains were recovered from the Mary Rose, the flagship of Henry VIII, sunk in 1545 and re-raised in 1982. Hatch is thought to have been a mongrel, and was brought on board to control the rat population.The breed name comes from the occupation of its earliest ancestors brought to the US by working-class British migrants as the dogs were used in rat-baiting. However they were, for the most part, bred for speed. Their speed is used for controlling vermin and hunting small game such as squirrels and hares. After the 1890s, as the breed type became popular in America, Beagles, Italian Greyhounds and Miniature Pinschers were bred in. Many of the foundation Rat Terriers were indistinguishable from small mixed-breed hunting dogs known as \"feists\". The smaller varieties diverged from the Rat Terrier line very early on, with UKC registration for the Toy Fox Terrier beginning in 1936.\nRat Terriers were cherished as loyal hunting companions and efficient killers of vermin on 20th century American farms: as a result, they were one of the most popular dog types from the 1920s to the 1940s. However the widespread use of chemical pesticides and the growth of commercial farming led to a sharp decline in the breed from the 1950s onwards. Breed loyalists maintained the bloodline, leading to the modern Rat Terrier.\nThe genetic diversity of the Rat Terrier has contributed to the overall health, keen intelligence, and soundness of the breed. Most modern breeds were developed from a few founding dogs and then propagated from a closed gene pool. In contrast, the Rat Terrier has benefited from a long history of refinement with regular outcrosses to bring in useful qualities and genetic variability.\nIn the current times, the Rat Terrier is becoming popular not only as a family pet but as a working dog in several fields.\nTheir affectionate and calm temperament along with small size has made them popular as service dogs in hospice, treatment for depression, in Assisted Living, and other human care jobs.\nPolice departments have started using them as contraband search dogs as their intelligence level shortens training to as little as 3 weeks which is much shorter than for traditional police service breeds.  Also, their small size allows search of cars, homes, and prison cells without causing the major damage a large German Shepherd or other traditional police service breed would do during a car search and lessening the chances of major financial settlements if there is nothing found during a search.\n\n\n== Breed recognition ==\nRat Terrier organizations exhibit the typical disputes over the course of action to be taken for the promotion and preservation of the breed. As usual among working breeds, points of departure are which dog type best represents the breed and whether the dog's working qualities will be sacrificed to selection for conformation show competition.\n\nThe Rat Terrier Club of America is the official breed parent club for the American Kennel Club.  Rat Terriers were accepted into the AKC's terrier group June 2012.  Rat terriers have been competing in the United Kennel Club events for over 15 years. UKC is a family-friendly group that promotes many different venues for dogs to compete. The National Rat Terrier Association is the largest independent registry and has maintained lineage records for decades. Feeling the working terrier nature of the breed will suffer, it is the most prominent of those clubs and associations opposed to Kennel Club closed-registry breeding rules.\nThe Decker Hunting Terrier Registry was created specifically for the Decker Giant. This registry's mission is to keep all the qualities that set the Decker aside from the standard Rat Terrier, while retaining and improving upon the hunting ability.\nThe UKC officially recognized the breed on January 1, 1999.  The AKC recognized the Rat Terrier as a breed on July 1, 2010, however allowed them to compete in companion events beginning January 1, 2006 in sanctioned AKC Companion events (Obedience, Agility, Rally).  The first Rat Terrier to earn a title under AKC Sanctioning was in Agility on January 14, 2006 in Van Nuys, California by Harpur's Giddy Upp \"Gigi\" and D. Davidson Harpur. AKC accepted the rat terrier into the terrier group in June 2012. The first AKC Champion Rat Terrier was \"Annie\"  GCH GRCH King Pen RnB\u2019s Queen Ann bred, owned by Sherry & Dud Lee Hendrix of Modesto, California.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRat Terrier Club of America (AKC Parent Club)\nUniversal Kennel Club International\nNational Rat Terrier Club and Registry\nUnited Kennel Club\nAmerican Kennel Club"}, {"id": 406, "name": "Redbone Coonhound", "country": "United States", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog406", "description": "The Redbone Coonhound is an American breed of dog used for hunting raccoon, deer, bear, and cougar. The American Kennel Club standard says, \"The Redbone mingles handsome looks and an even temperament with a confident air and fine hunting talents.\" This breed has been registered with the United Kennel Club since 1902 and the American Kennel Club since 2009.  The Redbone is the breed of hound featured in the classic novel Where the Red Fern Grows.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Redbone Coonhound has a lean, muscular, well proportioned build. The body type is typical to the coonhounds subgroup, with long straight legs, a deep chest, and a head and tail that are held high and proud when hunting or showing. The Redbone Coonhound has brown eyes and a face that is often described as having a pleading expression. The dog's eyes may be dark brown to hazel, but a darker color is preferred. The coat is short and smooth against the body, but coarse enough to provide protection to the skin while hunting through dense underbrush. The large paws have especially thick pads, with webbed toes, and dewclaws are common.  The nose is often black and prominent. The ears are floppy and will most likely extend to nearly the end of the nose if stretched out. Coloration of the nose is black, and the coat color is always a rich red, though a small amount of white on the chest, between the legs, or on the feet is sometimes seen. The white chest and feet markings that occasionally appear on  Redbone Coonhound puppies today is most likely a throwback to the mixing of Bloodhound and Foxhound bloodlines.  Variations of black fur on the face and muzzle are also not uncommon.\nMales tend to be 22-27 inches (56-68.5 cm) at the shoulder, with females slightly shorter at 21-26 inches (53\u201366 cm). Weight should be proportional to the size and bone structure of the individual dogs, with a preference towards leaner working dogs rather than heavier dogs. Generally, weights will range from 45 to 70 lbs (20.5 to 31.75 kg).\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Redbone Coonhound is affectionate, gentle, and has a strong desire to please its owner.The Redbone is an extremely vocal dog, as would be expected of a hound. The breed is known for its distinctive \"drawling\" bark, also known as a bay. Hunters who use the breed follow the sound of the voice as the dogs track quarry. It takes training to first control their excited, emotional, booming barks, but also to help provide the hounds an outlet for their 'tracking' desires that sometimes drive their vocalizations. A Redbone Coonhound will have a \"specific\" bay when it has an animal either treed or cornered. This bay is very much distinguishable from their normal day to day baying. A Redbone's bay helps when hunting. A Redbone Coonhound's training is a key component to creating a capable hunting dog. Proper training should begin as soon as possible. The Redbone Coonhound has a stubborn mindset that can work to the owners advantage, but the Redbone can also absorb a significant amount of information that can help with creating a reliable hunting dog. \n\nRedbones do not reach full physical and mental maturity until the age of two years, comparatively slower than many other breeds. As with all breeds, puppies and adolescents are more energetic than adults and need lots of activity or they will become destructive, often chewing furniture, chewing shoes, and snooping around the garbage. When going through obedience training it is imperative for a pet owner to know that harsher methods are not effective with this breed. Coonhounds are typically stubborn but can also be sensitive; being overbearing can frighten the animal.  Once trained and aware of its size the breed is known to be very gentle and can be trusted with children.  While playing with older children they will happily jump into the family swimming pool to play. The dogs are adept in the water and can be compared to other water-loving breeds like the Labrador Retriever in swimming ability.\nCoonhounds are in the same group as well known breeds such as the Beagle, Basset Hound, and Bloodhound: they are bred primarily to track game using sight and scent over long distances. They also instinctively mark their position for following hunters by vocalizing as they catch up with their quarry. Therefore, this breed will have the desire to chase small animals such as rabbits, squirrels, badgers, or even cats. A Redbone Coonhound should have a tall fence to retain the animal and keep it from wandering.\nHunting dogs require a good deal of exercise to stay happy and healthy. The breed is best suited to the countryside or suburbs; urban environments are less than ideal but workable so long as they get roughly an hour and a half or more of walking per day. Redbones are known to have an independent intelligence especially well suited for problem solving. This can be an issue if the problem they want to solve is their backyard fence or the dog-proof garbage. Most Redbones require leashes to avoid wandering. In a hunt setting they will often make quarter mile loops away from the pack searching for scent of their prey before returning or using their bay to raise the alarm, thus bringing the pack to their aid. When breeding the Redbone Coonhound, traits such as determination and endurance created a dog that isn't afraid to hunt until its exercise is accomplished.  Because of their instinctive desire to follow scents, they are eager to follow their noses and may ignore their owners' commands.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the late 18th century, many European-type hunting dogs were imported to America, most of them of Scottish, French, English, and Irish ancestry: the English Foxhound, the Harrier, the Grand Bleu de Gascogne, the Welsh Hound, the Beagle, and the Bloodhound were among these. Most often, these dogs were imported so that wealthy planters of the Tidewater could engage in foxhunting. Over time, Southern hunters selectively bred dogs that would not back down, had great stamina, and would \"hound\" their prey until they treed or cornered their exhausted quarry, leading to modern coonhounds.\n\nIn the late 18th century Scottish immigrants brought red-colored foxhounds to Georgia, which would be the foundation stock of the Redbone. Later, approximately 1840, Irish-bred Foxhound and  Bloodhound lines were added. The name came from an early breeder, Peter Redbone of Tennessee, though other breeders of note are Redbone's contemporary, George F.L. Birdsong of Georgia, and Dr. Thomas Henry in the 19th century. Over time, breeders followed a selective program that led to a coonhound that is specialized for prey which climbs trees, was unafraid of taking on large animals,  was agile enough to carry on over mountain or in meadow, and liked to swim if necessary. They were ideal for pack hunting of both small and larger prey. Originally, the Redbone had a black saddleback, but by the beginning of the 20th century, it was an uninterrupted red tone.Like many American hunting dogs, especially those from the South, they were widely known by hunters and farmers, but not well known in the show ring. The Redbone has found recognition by the two major American kennel clubs.  Because of its main use as a hunting dog rather than a show dog  Redbones are extremely rare dogs outside of the United States. There are very few breeders outside of North America and it is virtually unknown in Europe or Australia.\nThe Redbone Coonhound was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1902, becoming the second coonhound breed to gain recognition.The Redbone Coonhound was popularized after the novel Where the Red Fern Grows, written by Wilson Rawls, was published in 1961. It told the story of Billy Colman and his Redbones.The Redbone Coonhound was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2010. It was shown at the  Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show for the first time in 2011.\n\n\n== Famous Redbone Coonhounds ==\nWhere the Red Fern Grows is a story about two Redbone Coonhounds (\"Old Dan\" and \"Little Ann\") and their owner Billy Colman. The book was written by Wilson Rawls in 1961, then turned into a movie in 1974.\nThe Hound That Thought He Was a Raccoon is a story about a young Coonhound puppy raised by a family of raccoons. The film was made by Walt Disney Productions in 1960.\nThe Outlaw Josey Wales is a story of a Civil War Veteran who has everything, including his family, taken from him by a group of renegade Union Soldiers.  During his quest for vengeance, he picks up other loners who accompany him on his path, one of which is a Redbone Coonhound.\nArthur Ownby, one of the main characters in Cormac McCarthy's first ever published novel, The Orchard Keeper, owns a three legged Redbone Coonhound named Scout. The dog accompanies him as he attempts to escape the authorities after a shootout at his cabin, and is later shot after Arthur is sent to live out his days in a mental hospital.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRedbone Coonhound at Curlie"}, {"id": 407, "name": "Rhodesian Ridgeback", "country": "Zimbabwe", "type": "Sighthound and Pariah", "picture": "dog407", "description": "The Rhodesian Ridgeback is a dog breed developed in the Southern Africa region. Its forebears can be traced to the semi-domesticated, ridged hunting dogs of the Khoikhoi, which were crossed with European dogs by the early colonists of the Cape Colony of southern Africa. The original breed standard was drafted by F. R. Barnes, in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia  (now Zimbabwe), in 1922, who named the breed the Rhodesian Ridgeback. The standard was approved by the South African Kennel Union in 1927.\nThe Rhodesian Ridgeback has also previously been known as Van Rooyen's lion dog or the African Lion Hound or African Lion Dog\u2014simba inja in Ndebele, shumba imbwa in Shona\u2014because of its ability to keep a lion at bay while awaiting its master's arrival.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Khoikhoi people who lived in the Cape Peninsula when the Dutch began trading with the area during the mid 17th century, had a hunting dog which was described as ugly, but noted for its ferocity when acting as a guard dog. This dog measured approximately 18 inches (46 cm) at the withers, with a lean but muscular frame. The ears have been described both as erect and hanging, but the most distinctive feature was the length of hair often growing in the reverse direction along its back. Within 53 years of Dutch colonisation in Southern Africa and the origins of the wagon-trekking boers  later known as Afrikaners, who converted vast stretches of wild veld into farmland, hunted for meat and defended their cattle herds, staff, and homesteads from lion, the Europeans were using these local dogs themselves.By the 1860s, European colonisers had also imported a variety of mainly European dog breeds to this area of Africa, including such dedicated hunting dogs as Great Danes, Bloodhounds, Greyhounds, and terriers. Genetic analysis indicates that there has been admixture between the Great Dane and the Ridgeback, indicating the Dane's major contribution. These breeds were bred with the indigenous African dogs, including the dog of the Khoikhoi people, which resulted in the Boer hunting dogs, generically called names such as boerhund (Boer hound) in Dutch then its descendant language of Afrikaans, which are the chief forerunners to the modern Rhodesian Ridgeback.\" Other breeds came from Arabian traders around the Horn of Africa and with Asian immigrants, particularly into the Cape Colony, and jackal coursing introduced from British India brought lurchers from England and Ireland and the borzoi or Russian wolfhound, and before the era of standardised modern breeds, several breeds may have more rarely contributed to Rhodesian Ridgeback genetics.Reverend Charles Helm (1844\u20131915), son of Reverend Daniel Helm of the London Missionary Society, was born in the Cape Colony, joined the London Missionary Society himself, and moved from the Zuurbraak (now Suurbraak) mission station just east of Swellendam (modern Western Cape Province, South Africa) to the Hope Fountain Mission in Matabeleland, Southern Rhodesia, travelling from October 1874 to December 1875, then bringing two ridged dog bitches from somewhere between Kimberley (modern Northern Cape Province, South Africa) and Swellendam with him to Hope Fountain in 1879 en route to becoming, as it would turn out, a political advisor to King Lobengula, house-host to hunter-explorer Frederick Courteney Selous, postmaster of Bulawayo and well-appreciated tooth-extractor. At Hope Fountain, now part of the city of Bulawayo, fellow South African transplant Cornelis van Rooyen (b. 1860, Uitenhage, modern Eastern Cape Province, South Africa), a big\u2013game hunter, was married to Maria Vermaak of Bloemhof by Reverend Helm in 1879 the same year Helm brought his two rough-coated grey-black bitches to the Mission. Van Rooyen saw Helm's pair of bitches and decided to breed his own dogs with them to incorporate their guarding abilities. It is not known if these two first direct ancestors of Rhodesian Ridgebacks had dorsal hair pattern ridges themselves, but they founded the Rhodesian Ridgeback bloodline, so either carried the trait or it was added from other Boer dogs and hybrids with Khoikhoi ridgebacks which van Rooyen bred into his lines over many trials then generations.After trying pointers and Airedales, crossing with collies gave van Rooyen the best lion hunters, as his son Cornelis Jr. tells us. Pointers, bulldogs (perhaps boerboels, which were actually mainly larger mastiffs) and greyhounds are generally credited in the European core of this mix, with larger terriers such as Irish terriers and perhaps great Danes. Modern Rhodesian Ridgeback breeders speak of some of their ridgebacks being too 'mastiffy' though it is uncertain what extent, if any, of actual mastiff heredity may have entered, as from the boerboels and their descendants prevalent in these territories. After initially greyer, rough-coated litters originating from Helm's dogs, van Rooyen's subsequently crossed offspring turned to redder coats, incorporating the KhoiKhoi landrace dog's ridges already carried in Boer dogs within his genomes. They became the foundation stock of a kennel which developed dogs over the next 35 years with the ability to bay a lion by darting in and out but staying out of its reach until the hunter shot it. However, dogs that took risks were sometimes killed by lions, leaving those that were more careful to breed. These dogs were used to clear farmland of  wild pigs and baboons, and they can kill a baboon independently of a human hunter's collaboration.The original breed standard for the Rhodesian Lion Dog was drafted in 1922 by F. R. Barnes on founding the first Ridgeback Club at a Bulawayo Kennel Club show, then in Southern Rhodesia (now in Zimbabwe), and based on that of the Dalmatian. In 1927, Barnes' standard was approved by the South African Kennel Union with the name amended to Rhodesian Ridgeback. Outside the subcontinent and internationally, the first Rhodesian Ridgebacks in Britain were shown by Mrs. Edward Foljambe in 1928. In 1950, Mr. and Mrs. William H. O'Brien of Arizona brought six carefully selected Ridgebacks to the US from South Africa. He and his wife and Margaret Lowthian of California began the process of getting the breed accepted by the American Kennel Club. Similarly, in 1952, The Rhodesian Ridgeback Club of Great Britain was founded at Crufts to promote the breed around the United Kingdom to show judges, so a standard for the breed might be recognised. In 1954 the first Challenge Certificates were awarded to dogs shown as Rhodesian Ridgebacks at United Kingdom competitions, toward their subsequent recognition by The Kennel Club of Great Britain, and in 1955 the American Kennel Club recognised the Rhodesian Ridgeback breed as a member of the hound group.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Rhodesian Ridgeback's distinguishing feature is the ridge of hair running along its back in the opposite direction from the rest of its coat. It consists of a fan-like area formed by two whorls of hair (called \"crowns\") and tapers from immediately behind the shoulders down to the level of the hips. The ridge is usually about 2 inches (51 mm) in width at its widest point. It is believed to originate from the dog used by the original African dog population which had a similar ridge. The first depiction of a ridgeback is a wall painting describing the life of the Boers, housed in South Africa in the Voortrekker Monument.Male ridgebacks usually stand 25\u201327 in (64\u201369 cm) at the withers and weigh about 36.5 kg (80 lb) (FCI standard); females are typically 24\u201326 inches (61\u201366 cm) tall and about 32 kg (71 lb) in weight. Ridgebacks are typically muscular and have a light wheaten to red wheaten coat, which should be short, dense, sleek and glossy in appearance, and neither woolly nor silky.White is acceptable on the chest and toes. The presence of black guard hairs or ticking is not addressed in the AKC standard, although the elaboration of the AKC standard notes the amount of black or dark brown in the coat should not be excessive. The FCI standard states that excessive black hairs throughout the coat are highly undesirable. Ridgebacks sometimes have a dark mask. The dog's nose should be black or liver in keeping with the colour of the dog. No other coloured nose is permissible. The brown nose is a recessive gene. It is not as common as a black nose; some breeders believe the inclusion of brown noses in a breeding program is necessary for maintaining the vibrancy of the coat. The eyes should be round and should reflect the dog's colour: dark eyes with a black nose, amber eyes with a brown (liver) nose. Ridgebacks have a strong, smooth tail, which is usually carried in a gentle curve backwards.The original standard allowed for a variety of coat colours, including brindle and sable. The modern FCI standard calls for light wheaten to red wheaten.Other dog breeds also have a reverse line of fur along the spine, including the Phu Quoc ridgeback dog and Thai ridgeback. The Thai ridgeback is a crossbreed of the Phu Quoc; historians have speculated the relationship between the Rhodesian Ridgeback and the Phu Quoc with suggestions that historically one breed may have been imported to the other's location.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nRhodesian Ridgebacks are known to be loyal and intelligent. They are typically somewhat aloof to strangers; this is not to be confused with aggression, a Rhodesian Ridgeback with a good temperament will not attack a stranger for no reason. They require consistent training and correct socialization; they are often not the best choice for inexperienced dog owners. Rhodesian Ridgebacks are strong-willed and confident dogs. They are protective of their owners and families; if trained well, they can be excellent guard dogs.Despite Rhodesian Ridgebacks being extremely athletic and sometimes imposing, they do have a sensitive side. Francis R. Barnes, who wrote the first standard in 1922, acknowledged that, \"rough treatment ... should never be administered to these dogs, especially when they are young. They go to pieces with handling of that kind.\" The Rhodesian Ridgeback accepts correction as long as it is fair and justified, and as long as it comes from someone the dog knows and trusts.\n\n\n== Ridge genetics ==\n\nThe genotype responsible for the ridge was recently found by a consortium of researchers at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (Nicolette Salmon Hillbertz, G\u00f6ran Andersson, et al.), Uppsala University (Leif Andersson, Mats Nilsson, et al.) and the Broad Institute (Kerstin Lindblad-Toh, et al.).The only disqualification in the AKC standard for this breed is \"ridgelessness\". This term refers to the purebred offspring of heterozygous parental animals that do not inherit a copy of the ridge mutation from either parent and are, in effect, normal dogs without a ridged back. The most current research suggests that the ridge mutation is autosomal dominant with complete penetrance. However, while the few studies that have analyzed the issue do not agree on the incidence of ridgelessness within the breed, they all show a ridgeless rate significantly lower than 25%, which cannot be explained using the Punnett square model for single gene/two allele inheritance.One possible reason for these studies to deviate from the expected 25% incidence of ridgelessness is inclusion of parents who were not heterozygous (possessing a copy of both the ridgeless and ridged allele) in the study. The inclusion of homozygotes (possessing two copies of the ridged alleles) would make the observed incidence be less than 25% when averaged across the population in the study.  Heterozygotes are detected by mating the animal in question to either known heterozygotes or known homozygous recessives (other methods exist such as mating to offspring, but result in inbred offspring) and a heterozygote is detected when a ridgeless pup is born. Note that many matings are required to have a high probability of detecting a homozygous dominant (once a ridgeless pup is produced, the animal in question is assumed to be heterozygous without question), and more than one sire can produce the pups in one litter. The latter fact can cast doubt on the calling of male heterozygotes by this method and could possibly lead to the results shown in studies testing the mode of inheritance of ridgelessness.Traditionally, many ridgeback puppies were culled at birth for numerous reasons, including ridgelessness. Contemporary breeders are increasingly opting for surgical sterilisation of these offspring to ensure they will not be bred but can live into maturity as non-showing, non-breeding pets. Some breed parent clubs and canine registries in Europe have even made the culling of ridgeless whelps a requirement. It was pointed out on the BBC One investigative documentary Pedigree Dogs Exposed that the Rhodesian Ridgeback Club of Great Britain's \"code of ethics\", which is ratified annually by the kennel club states that \"Ridgeless puppies shall be culled\", and that \"mismarked\" puppies will only ever be sold on condition that they are never shown, and are neutered. The Ridgeback Club defended itself pointing to the statement that follows, \"if a breeder finds this morally impossible [to cull the puppy] the puppy shall be homed...\" as indication that culling is not mandatory, but preferred. It was only after the publicity surrounding the promotion of culling that they reversed their code of ethics to say \"no healthy puppy will be culled\".\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Classification conundrum ==\nThe historic and modern hunting uses of Rhodesian Ridgebacks have included everything from upland game birds to larger 'dangerous game'. While the hunting versatility of the breed has served it well in the field, it has caused much confusion and contention among ridgeback fanciers about what these dogs are, and are not, as hunting companions. Throughout its history, the Rhodesian Ridgeback has been a breed of dog that has somewhat defied the strict interpretation of most conventional group classification paradigms.\n\n\n=== Classification history ===\nIn 1922 Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Francis Barnes standardised the breed using the existing Dalmatian standard as a model - there was no mention of a preferred group placement. Although no parent club was 'officially' recognised at the time, in September 1924 the South African Kennel Union began taking \"lion dog\" registrations. In February 1926, SAKU (KUSA) officially recognised the Rhodesian Parent Club. At the behest of Barnes, SAKU also made two changes at this time:\n\nThe union's official name for the breed was changed from 'Rhodesian lion dog' to 'Rhodesian Ridgeback'.\nThe breed was placed in the union's 'gundog' group.On this second point Barnes was emphatic, stating \"I am breeding a gundog.\" The Rhodesian Ridgeback remained classified as a gundog for over 20 years thence.\n\nAlthough the Rhodesian Ridgeback's bird hunting prowess has been well known throughout the breed's history (the original description from the South African parent club belabors this point in fact), it is important to note that the \"gundog\" classification made in 1920s Southern Rhodesia and South Africa was not specifically about bird hunting. To understand this it is necessary to understand the union's classification system at that time. The two likely categories Barnes could have chosen from within the SAKU classification system at that time were, \"sporting\" and \"gundog\". In the \"sporting\" group were the sighthounds and scenthounds. In the \"gundog\" group were the birddogs. This raises the question why Barnes rejected the group containing the sighthounds and scenthounds, and successfully lobbied in favour of the group containing the birddogs. Barnes' reasoning becomes clear with an understanding of the distinction between the two groups. The union's \"sporting\" dogs were those that would find game above ground, and were then expected to dispatch the game without assistance. The union's \"gundogs\" were those that find game above ground, and the human hunter was then expected to dispatch the game by means of a firearm. Within this context, the Rhodesian Ridgeback\u2014which was clearly expected to hold the lion at bay for the hunter, not to attempt to dispatch the lion unassisted by the gun\u2014placement in the union\u2019s gundog group becomes the logical choice within that system as it existed at that time.Over time the culturally perceived meanings of the group labels had changed to those closer to their modern meanings, and the union eventually became a federated member of the FCI, and therefore adopted its group categorisation system. By 1940, Barnes had resigned from the Rhodesian Parent Club and prompted by the lobbying of a newer generation of leadership within the Rhodesian Parent Club, in the 1950s, the breed's group classification was changed from \"gundog\" to \"hound\".\n\n\n=== Classification theories ===\n\nToday, there are at least five competing theories concerning proper group placement for the Rhodesian Ridgeback.\nScenthound\n- This theory arises from the fact that the southern African landscape in general, and the Zimbabwean landscape specifically, is an extremely varied and diverse terrain, where a true sighthound would be severely handicapped in its finding ability in the game producing cover of the bushveldt, thornveldt, and kopjes. Proponents of the scenthound classification also observe that the ridgeback bears very little resemblance to the decidedly northern African desert breed sighthounds, in either form or function. And while proponents of this theory freely admit that ridgebacks are undoubtedly athletic 'running' dogs, they draw the distinction that ridgebacks do not pursue game by sheer speed, which is typical of the true sighthounds associated with the northern half of the continent.Sighthound\n- This theory is based on the fact that some of the foundation stock used by Cornelius Van Rooyen during the creation of the breed was sighthound stock. Support for this theory has grown in areas (most notably in the United States) where ridgebacks have been allowed to compete with sighthounds in lure-coursing field trials. The theory's detractors contend that success in lure coursing trials does not in and of itself make a dog a true sighthound, and further bolster their contention by pointing out that ridgebacks are very poor performers when allowed to run in unofficial open field courses where they typically cannot keep up with the true sighthounds. Even so, no one can argue that ridgebacks have not been successful at lure coursing events. In fact ridgebacks have been very competitive in almost every lure coursing venue in which they have been allowed to compete. Proponents of this theory will often further defend it with a (debated) claim that while ridgebacks are versatile and use all their senses, their first and strongest inclination is to find game by sight\u2014which itself is considered normal for dogs of any type, when the game is actually in sight.Cur-dog\n- This theory is based on the United Kennel Club's (the leading 'working dog' registry in the U.S. in terms of numbers of dogs registered) classification system which, within the scenthounds, includes a sub-group known as \"cur dogs\". Contrary to the traditional/historical meaning of the term \"cur\", these dogs are neither mongrels, nor dogs of dubious breeding or value. Quite the contrary, the UKC cur-dogs are pure-bred, versatile hunting and livestock dogs. These pure breeds were typically developed by pioneering people who needed a dog that was highly protective of the family and farm, as well as a capable stock driver. Most importantly the dog was required to pursue various species of game both small and large game alike, in a manner inconsistent with the rest of the hounds (sight or scent). The cur-dog does so using all of its senses - hearing, sight, and scent as the situation demands. This classification theory is consistent with old breed descriptions, which are somewhat contrary to the more classical sighthound/scenthound types, like the one offered in an advertisement run by the Rhodesian Parent Club in a show catalogue in 1926, \"... Rhodesian Ridgeback (lion dogs) are unsurpassed for hunting and veld work. Ever faithful and loyal to their owners, highly intelligent and reliable guards.\"Wagon dog/wagon hound\n- This theory was forwarded at the 2008 Rhodesian Ridgeback World Congress, and contends that an honest evaluation of the breed's functional history indicates that during its formative development and early use as a breed, the ridgeback was much more a \"hunter's/farmer's ox-wagon dog\" than it was a \"lion dog\". This theory aligns itself with the current FCI classification of the breed, group 6.3 (a special type of scenthound). However, the important distinction in this theory is not that the FCI classification of \"scenthound\" is accurate, but rather, that placing the Dalmatian and the Rhodesian Ridgeback (the only breeds currently in FCI group 6.3), breeds that historically have served as versatile hunting/wagon dogs, should indeed be classified as two examples of the same type of dog, but further asserts that such dogs\u2019 classification makes more sense as a discrete group. This classification theory is generally supported by historical accounts that mirror the one offered by Phyllis Archdale who went to Southern Africa in 1919 and bred ridgebacks there in the 1920s, \"Old timers told me that in early days most Dutch transport riders had a Ridgehound as guard to their wagons. They were used to bail up lion and wild pig. Mine did both...\"\n\nRidged primitive\n- There is also a group of ridgeback fanciers who believe Rhodesian Ridgebacks should be thought of in terms of the FCI's group 5.8. FCI group 5 includes the spitz and related primitives. FCI group 5.8 specifically is \"primitive type hunting dogs with a ridge on the back\". The theory's detractors note that the Rhodesian Ridgeback was not only developed in the late 19th century and standardised in the early 20th century, but developed specifically to \"hunt to the gun\" and as such is in fact a very modern creation, and anything but \"primitive\". But supporters of the theory contend that enough of the foundational stock is ancient, including the greyhound and the Khoikhoi dog (from which the ridged back derives), that even though it was developed relatively recently and for use with modern firearms, the breed can still be considered to be of a \"primitive type\".\n\n\n=== Current registry classifications ===\nPresently, the breed is categorised as a \"hound\" by every major registry throughout the world. For example, the British Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel club both categorise the Rhodesian Ridgeback as a hound, without any further specification. Both of the major registries in the United States, the AKC and the UKC, currently further distinguish the breed as a sighthound. The FCI, the largest international canine governing body, which looks to the parent club in the country of origin (the parent club in Zimbabwe) for the breed standard and group classification, currently further distinguishes the Rhodesian Ridgeback as a scenthound.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nHealth conditions that are known to affect this breed are hip dysplasia and dermoid sinus. The ridgeback ranks number six in terms of most affected breeds for thyroid problems recorded by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals. In 2014, the UK breed survey reported an average lifespan of 11 years.\n\n\n=== Dermoid sinus ===\nDermoid sinus is a congenital neural-tube defect that is known to affect this breed. The dermoid is often likened to a thin \"spaghetti strand\" beneath the skin. Puppies should always be screened at birth by the breeder and veterinarian, and the examination repeated as the puppies grow before they go to their new homes. This is done by palpation of the subcutaneous dorsal midline from the base of the skull to the insertion of the tail. Surgical removal is an option for affected neonates, puppies and adult dogs. All affected dogs, even those surgically corrected, should be spayed or neutered and never be bred, since surgical dermoid sinus removal can be extremely cost prohibitive, and because many unremoved dermoid sinuses will eventually abscess. Abscessed dermoid sinuses will be at best a recurrent, painful problem, and if the sinus communicates with the tissues around the spinal cord, cause meningitis and often death. However, it has been shown that supplementation of folic acid to the diet of the brood bitch before mating and during pregnancy reduces the incidence of dermoid sinus. One study on the Swedish population estimates that 8-10% are affected. Slightly less than 5% of ridgebacks were reported to be affected with the condition in a US breed club survey.\n\n\n=== Degenerative myelopathy ===\nDegenerative myelopathy (DM) is a neurological disease of the spinal cord causing progressive paraparesis, most commonly in the German shepherd dog breed. It affects Rhodesian Ridgebacks at a rate of only 0.75%. Signs of degenerative myelopathy are characterised at the beginning with foot dragging, and slipping of the rear limbs. The disease progresses to the point where the animal can no longer stand or walk on its own. Progression has been known to take as little as six months, or several years. There is a DNA test offered by the Orthopedic Foundation of Animals, to test for the gene. Animals who are at risk for the disease should not be bred to other animals at risk, as this creates future generations of this debilitating disease.\n\n\n=== Hypothyroid ===\nHypothyroidism is a growing problem in the Rhodesian Ridgeback, and this condition causes a multitude of symptoms, including weight gain and hair loss. Treatment for hypothyroidism in dogs consists of an inexpensive once-daily oral medication. Dr. Lorna Kennedy at the University of Manchester\u2019s Centre for Integrated Genomic Medical Research in England has found the haplotype (group of genes), which, when present, double the chances of a Ridgeback becoming hypothyroid due to lymphocytic thyroiditis. This is important to the breed because lymphocytic thyroiditis is the overwhelming cause of hypothyroidism in ridgebacks.\n\n\n=== Gastric dilatation volvulus ===\nLike many other deep-chested breeds, ridgebacks are prone to gastric dilatation volvulus, commonly known as bloat. This is a potentially fatal condition that requires immediate treatment.\n\n\n=== Resources ===\nRRCUS H&G - the Rhodesian Ridgeback Club of the United States maintains a web site devoted to the breed's health issues that also gathers ongoing research for their Health & Genetics Committee. This group recommends that breeders perform at least four health screenings: hips, elbows, thyroid and eyes, with cardiac and hearing tests optional.\nCRRHS - it is also recommended that all ridgeback owners enter their dogs' information in the Comprehensive Rhodesian Ridgeback Health Survey.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBay dog\nCur Dogs\nHound Group\nLion hunting\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nRhodesian Ridgeback at Curlie\nHistory of the Rhodesian Ridgeback- from the archive of the history and life of Rhodesia.\nRhodesian Ridgeback Breed Guide"}, {"id": 408, "name": "Rottweiler", "country": "Germany", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog408", "description": "The Rottweiler (, UK also ) is a breed of domestic dog, regarded as medium-to-large or large. The dogs were known in German as Rottweiler Metzgerhund, meaning Rottweil butchers' dogs, because their main use was to herd livestock and pull carts laden with butchered meat to market. This continued until the mid-19th century when railways replaced droving. Although still used to herd stock in many parts of the world, Rottweilers are now also used as search and rescue dogs, as guard dogs, and as police dogs.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Rottweiler is one of the oldest of herding breeds. With a history possibly dating back to the Roman Empire, the Rottweiler may be a descendant of ancient Roman drover dogs; a mastiff-type dog that was a dependable, rugged dog with great intelligence and guarding instincts. During their quest to conquer Europe, the Roman legions traveled in large numbers across the continent. The lack of refrigeration meant soldiers brought herds of cattle for food. Drover dogs kept the herd together and guarded it at night. Around A.D. 74 the Roman army travelled across the Alps and into what is now southern Germany. For the next two centuries the Roman drover dogs were continually used in herding and driving cattle for trade even after the Romans were driven out of the area by the Swabians.The dog breed was subsequently named after Rottweil, a town in the region. It became an important trade center and the descendants of the Roman cattle dogs proved their worth by driving the cattle to market and protecting the cattle from robbers and wild animals.\nThe dogs are said to have been used by traveling butchers at markets during the Middle Ages to guard money pouches tied around their necks. The dogs were eventually known as Rottweiler Metzgerhunds, or \"Butchers' Dogs\". As railroads became the primary method for moving stock to market, the demand for the Rottweiler breed declined, as did their numbers, so severely diminished by 1882 that a show in Heilbronn, featured only one very poor representative of the breed.The buildup to World War I saw a great demand for police dogs, which led to a revival of interest in the Rottweiler. During the First and Second World Wars, Rottweilers saw service in various roles, including as messenger, ambulance, draught, and guard dogs.\nThe Deutscher Rottweiler-Klub (DRK, German Rottweiler Club), the first Rottweiler club in Germany, was founded on 13 January 1914, and followed by the creation of the S\u00fcddeutscher Rottweiler-Klub (SDRK, South German Rottweiler Club) on 27 April 1915 and eventually became the IRK (International Rottweiler Club). The DRK counted around 500 Rottweilers, and the SDRK 3000 Rottweilers. The goals of the two clubs were different. The DRK aimed to produce working dogs and did not emphasise the morphology of the Rottweiler.\nThe various German Rottweiler Clubs amalgamated to form the Allgemeiner Deutscher Rottweiler Klub (ADRK, General German Rottweiler Club) in 1921. This was officially recorded in the register of clubs and associations at the district court of Stuttgart on 27 January 1924.  The ADRK is recognised worldwide as the home club of the Rottweiler.\nIn 1931 the Rottweiler was officially recognised by the American Kennel Club. In 1936, Rottweilers were exhibited in Britain at Crufts. In 1966, a separate register was opened for the breed. In fact, in the mid-1990s, the popularity of the Rottweiler reached an all-time high with it being the most registered dog by the American Kennel Club. In 2013, the American Kennel Club ranked the Rottweiler as the ninth-most popular pure-breed in the United States.\n\n\n== Technical description ==\n\"Rottweiler breeders aim at a dog of abundant strength, black coated with clearly defined rich tan markings, whose powerful appearance does not lack nobility and which is exceptionally well suited to being a companion, service and working dog.\" This breed is all about balance, endurance, proportionality, intelligence and strength. The various standards in place for the Rottweiler's physical appearance specify these characteristics.\n\nHead (eyes)\nSnout (teeth, tongue)\nDewlap (throat, neck skin)\nShoulder\nElbow\nForefeet\nHighest Point of the Rump\nLegs (thighs and hips)\nHock\nHind feet\nWithers\nStifle\nPaws\nTail\n\n\n=== Head ===\nThe skull is of medium length, relatively broad between the ears. The forehead line is moderately arched as seen from the side, with the occipital bone well developed without being conspicuous. The stop is relatively strong. Frontal groove not too deep.\nThe Rottweiler nose is well developed, more broad than round, with relatively large nostrils and always black. The muzzle should appear neither elongated nor shortened in relation to the cranial region. The ratio between the length of the muzzle and the length of the skull is about 1 to 1.5 The nasal bridge is straight, broad at the base and moderately tapered.\nThe lips are black and close fitting with the corner of the mouth not visible. The gums should be black, or as dark as possible. Both the upper and lower jaws are strong and broad. According to the FCI Standard Rottweilers should have strong and complete dentition (42 teeth) with scissor bite, the upper incisors closely overlapping the lower incisors. The zygomatic arches should be pronounced (but not exagerated). \nUpper and lower jaw strong and broad. Strong, complete dentition (42 teeth) with scissor bite, the upper incisors overlapping the lower incisors.\nThe eyes should be of medium size, almond-shaped and dark brown in colour.  The eyelids are close fitting and should not droop. The ears are medium-sized, pendant, triangular, wide apart, and set high on the head.  With the ears laid forward close to the head, the skull appears to be broadened. The skin on the head is tight fitting overall.  When the dog is alert, the forehead may be slightly wrinkled.\nFaults:\nHound-type head. Narrow, light too short, long, coarse or excessively molossoid head; excessively broad skull, (lack of stop, too little stop or too strong stop). Very deep frontal groove.\nForeface long, pointed or too short muzzle (any muzzle shorter than 40 percent of the length of the head is too short). split nose; Roman nose (convex nasal bridge) or dish-faced (concave nasal bridge); acquiline nose, pale or spotted nose (butterfly nose).\nPincer bite. Molars of the underjaw not standing in one line.\nSevere Faults: \nToo molossoid type and heavy general appearance. \n\n\n=== Neck ===\nThe neck is strong, of fair length, well muscled, slightly arched, clean, free from throatiness, without excessive dewlap.\n\n\n=== Body ===\n\nThe back is straight, strong and firm. The loins are short, strong and deep. The croup is broad, of medium length, and slightly rounded, neither flat nor falling away. The chest is roomy, broad and deep (approximately 50% of the shoulder height) with a well-developed forechest and well sprung ribs. The flanks are not tucked up.\n\n\n=== Tail ===\nThe FCI 2018 Standard states: In natural condition, strong, level in extension of the upperline; while paying attention, when excited or while moving it can be carried upward in a light curve; at ease it may be hanging. While positioned along the leg, the tail reaches approximately to the hocks or is a bit longer. \nHistorically the tail was traditionally docked at the first or second joint. However, docking is now banned in most countries and this is reflected in the FCI Country of Origin Breed Standard.Although once \"preferred\" in early Standards, in 2018 the FCI Standard was amended to classify the Natural Bob Tail (aka \"Stumpy\") as a \"Disqualifying Fault\" along with \"kink tail, ring-tail, with strong lateral deviation.\n\n\n=== Limbs ===\nWhen seen from the front, the front legs are straight and not placed close to each other. The forearm, seen from the side, stands straight and vertical.  The slope of the shoulder blade is about 45 degrees. The shoulders are well laid back. The upper arm is close fitting to the body. The forearm is strongly developed and muscular. Pasterns are slightly springy, strong but not steep. The front feet are round, tight and well arched, the pads hard, nails are short, black and strong.\nWhen seen from behind, the rear legs are straight and not too close together.  When standing free, obtuse angles are formed between the dog's upper thigh and the hip bone, the upper thigh and the lower thigh, and the lower thigh and metatarsal. The upper thigh is moderately long, broad and strongly muscled. The lower thigh is long, strongly and broadly muscled, sinewy. The hocks are sturdy, well angulated, not steep. The hind feet are slightly longer than the front feet.  Toes are strong, arched, as tight as the front feet.\n\n\n=== Gait ===\nAccording to the FCI Standard:\n\nThe Rottweiler is a trotting dog. In movement the back remains firm and relatively stable. Movement harmonious, steady full of energy and unrestricted, with good stride.However, \"sluggish action while trotting\" is considered a \"Severe Fault\".\n\nAccording to the American Kennel Council the traditional gait of a Rottweiler is a trot. Therefore, the Rottweiler is a trotter. Trotting in this breed is by no means a fault and is required. This movement comes naturally to the Rottweiler and should appear as such; any deviation may lead to a disqualification in the show ring. While walking, the Rottweiler's legs, both front and hind, should move in a straight forward and backward manner. As with the straight movement of the legs, the path the Rottweiler moves in should also be straight. The Rottweiler's gait is all about balance and effectiveness as the breed is still used as a herder today.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nThe coat consists of an outer coat and an undercoat.  The outer coat is of medium length, coarse, dense and flat.  The undercoat should be present on the neck and thighs. The undercoat must not show through the outer coat. Rottweilers living in hot climates may have acclimatised and may be missing the undercoat. Rottweiler coats tend to be low maintenance, although they experience heavy shedding before their seasons (females) or seasonally (males). According to American Kennel Club breed standards, a Rottweiler's coat is short and straight. A coat that is long or wavy is considered a flaw to the AKC.\n\n\n=== Color and markings ===\nThe color and markings of a Rottweiler are very distinctive. A Rottweiler is always, by any breed club standards, black with well-defined mahogany or rust-colored markings that do not take up more than ten percent of the dog's body color. All Rottweilers standard to AKC specifications have one mahogany dot above each eye on the inner brow ridge, on the cheeks, one strip on each side of the snout; cheek markings do not cross over the bridge of the nose, the top of the nose should remain black. The markings on the face should move down onto the dog's throat. On the chest, a Rottweiler will have two downward-facing triangular marks. On each front leg, the marks will stretch from the forearm to the toes. On the hind legs, the markings will begin on the inside and move outward onto the stifle, then out onto the hock stretching to the toes as well. AKC standards recognize that the black base color is not completely voided on the rear pasterns. There is a patch of rust or mahogany underneath the tail that resembles a triangle as well. A thin strip of black should be present on each of the Rottweiler's toes.\n\n\n=== Size ===\nTechnically a \"medium / large\" breed, according to the FCI standard the Rottweiler stands 61\u201369 cm (24\u201327 in) at the withers for males, 56\u201363 cm (22\u201325 in) for females, and the weight must be between 50 and 60 kg (110 and 132 lbs) for males and 35 and 48 kg (77 and 105 lbs) for females. Weight must be relative to height.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nAccording to the 2018 FCI Standard: the Rottweiler is good natured, placid in basic disposition, very devoted, obedient, biddable and eager to work. Their appearance is natural and rustic, their behaviour self-assured, steady and fearless. They react to their surroundings with great alertness and at the same time even-tempered. \nThe American Kennel Club says the Rottweiler is:a calm, confident and courageous dog with a self-assured aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships. A Rottweiler is self-confident and responds quietly and with a wait-and-see attitude to influences in its environment. It has an inherent desire to protect home and family, and is an intelligent dog of extreme hardness and adaptability with a strong willingness to work, making them especially suited as a companion, guardian and general all-purpose dog.\nAccording to the American Rottweiler Club:\n\nFor us, it is the best breed in the world, but it is not a dog for everyone. They require a calm, stable and firm \u201cpack leader\u201d or they will assume that role for you. They need socialization, exercise and stimulating mental challenges. With these things, you will have a wonderful companion.\nRottweilers are a powerful breed with well-developed genetic herding and guarding instincts. Potentially dangerous behaviour in Rottweilers usually results from irresponsible ownership, abuse, neglect, or lack of socialisation and training. However, the exceptional strength of the Rottweiler is an additional risk factor not to be neglected. It is for this reason that breed experts declare that formal training and extensive socialisation are essential for all Rottweilers. According to the AKC, Rottweilers love their owners and may behave in a clownish manner toward family and friends, but they are also protective of their territory and do not welcome strangers until properly introduced. Obedience training and socialization are required.One study published in 2008 found that male rottweilers have higher confidence, sharpness, and defense and play drives than females.A 2008 study surveying breed club members found that while Rottweilers were average in aggressiveness (bites or bite attempts) towards owners and other dogs, it indicated they tend to be more aggressive than average toward strangers.  This aggression appears correlated with watchdog and territorial instincts.In the Rottweiler Handbook, Joan H. Walker states that \"The Rottweiler is very territorial\", meaning that the owner will have to regularly work with the dog to control its territorial aggressiveness.\n\n\n== Working style ==\n\nAccording to the American Kennel Club, Rottweilers have a natural gathering style with a strong desire to control. They generally show a loose eye and have a great amount of force while working well off the stock. They make much use of their ability to intimidate.\nThe Rottweiler often carries the head on an even plane with the back, or carries the head up but with the neck and shoulders lowered. Some females lower the entire front end slightly when using their eyes. Males also do this when working far off the stock in an open field. This is rarely seen in males when working in confined spaces such as stock yards.\nThe Rottweiler has a reasonably good natural balance, force-barks when necessary, and when working cattle uses a very intimidating charge. There is a natural change in forcefulness when herding sheep. When working cattle, it may use its body and shoulders and for this reason should be used on horned stock with caution.\nThe Rottweiler, when working cattle, searches out the dominant animal and challenges it. Upon proving its control over that animal it settles back and tends to its work.\nSome growers have found that Rottweilers are especially suited to move stubborn stock that simply ignore Border Collies, Kelpies, and others. Rottweilers use their bodies to physically force the stubborn animal to do its bidding if necessary.\nWhen working with sheep, the Rottweiler shows a gathering/fetching style and reams directions easily. It drives sheep with ease.\nIn some cases, Rottweilers have begun herding cattle without any experience at all.\nIf worked on the same stock for any length of time, the Rottweiler tends to develop a bond with the stock and will become quite affectionate with them as long as they do as it directs.The Rottweiler is also exceptionally suited for and is commonly used in many dog sports including Agility and Schutzhund.\n\n\n=== Service Dog ===\nRottweilers have been used as service dogs. \"Stinky\" the Rottweiler saved a previous soldiers life, just by being there for an ex soldier experiencing post traumatic stress disorder. Stinky was inducted into the Purina Animal Hall of Fame in 2011 as service dog of the year.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nRottweilers are a relatively healthy, disease-free breed. As with most large breeds, hip dysplasia can be a problem. For this reason the various Rottweiler breed clubs have had x-ray testing regimens in place for many years. Osteochondritis dissecans, a condition affecting the shoulder joints, can also be a problem due to the breed's rapid growth rate.  A reputable breeder will have the hips and elbows of all breeding stock x-rayed and read by a recognised specialist, and will have paperwork to prove it.\nThey will also have certificates that their breeding animals do not have entropion or ectropion and that they have full and complete dentition with a scissor bite.\nAs with any breed, hereditary conditions occur in some lines. The Rottweiler is very prone to osteosarcoma which is among the most common causes of early death in Rottweilers.  For unknown reasons, Rottweilers are more susceptible than other breeds to become infected with parvovirus, a highly contagious and deadly disease of puppies and young dogs.If overfed or under-exercised, Rottweilers are prone to obesity. Some of the consequences of obesity can be very serious, including arthritis, breathing difficulties, diabetes, heart failure, reproductive problems, skin disease, reduced resistance to disease and overheating caused by the thick jacket of fat under the skin.Breed surveys in the US, UK and Denmark, and UK vet data puts the average lifespan of Rottweilers at 8 to 10 years.As with the vast majority of large-breed dogs, Rottweilers are also predisposed to dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\n\n== Media portrayal ==\nThe portrayal of Rottweilers as vicious or malevolently aggressive dogs in several fictional films and TV series, most notably in The Omen, along with sensationalist press coverage, has created a negative image of the breed. In the UK, Rottweilers are widely perceived as status dogs \u2013 potentially dangerous or aggressive dogs kept to intimidate others, and possibly as weapons. A few countries such as Ireland, Portugal, Romania, Malaysia, and Singapore place restrictions on the ownership of Rottweilers. Rottweilers are banned as pets in Ecuador.Some films and television shows, such as Lethal Weapon 3, the 1998 film Half Baked, and the hit HBO show Entourage, have portrayed Rottweilers in a positive light. They are also featured in the children's book series Good Dog, Carl by Alexandra Day.\nIn an event widely reported by the media, a two-year-old UK Rottweiler named Jake owned by Liz Maxted-Bluck was recognised for his bravery by the RSPCA. The dog was out walking with his owner when they heard screams. Jake chased off a man as he molested a woman on Hearsall Common, Coventry, in July 2009. He located the attacker and his victim in thick scrub, chased off the attacker, led his owner to the scene, then stood guard over the victim until police arrived. The attacker was convicted of serious sexual assault and jailed for four years. Jake was nominated by police for the bravery award and medallion after the incident. Det Con Clive Leftwich, from Coventry police station, said: \"From our point of view Jake the Rottweiler stopped a serious sexual assault from becoming even worse.\"\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBlackmore, Joan.

Physically it is similar to a Cocker Spaniel, but has a shorter, tighter coat and a longer body. Developed and used as hunting dogs, this breed does not suffer from any major health complaints other than those normally associated with spaniels. Popular in its native Russia, the breed was only introduced overseas in the 1990s, and is not yet recognised by any major kennel clubs.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Russian Spaniel is a small, sturdy dog with a short, tight, silky coat with feathering on the ears and legs. Colors can vary greatly, and can include solid colors without white markings, piebald, speckled, black and tan, and combinations. The head and ears are also usually dark.\nThe Russian Spaniel resembles the English Cocker Spaniel, with a body similar to the field lines of that breed though with the longer ears of the show line. The body of the Russian Spaniel tends to be longer than that of the English Cocker however, and the breed has only one line rather than being split into separate specific show and field lines of the same breed.Both the male and females of the breed weigh on average 28\u201340 lb (13\u201318 kg) and are around 15\u201317 inches (38\u201343 cm) at the withers. This makes them similar in size or a little larger than the English Cocker Spaniel which weighs approximately 13\u201314.5 kg (29\u201332 lb) and is on average between 15.5 and 16 inches (39 and 41 cm) with the females being a little smaller at 15\u201315.5 inches (38\u201339 cm).Bred primarily as hunting dogs, their goal is to find the bird, send it into the air and then to retrieve it on command after the hunter has shot the quarry. The Russian Spaniel is suited for hunting in marshland, fields, woodland, for birds as well as rabbits and other small game. The breed is also popular in their native Russia as their small size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, and easily transported to hunting sites.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nAs with all long-eared spaniels, Russian Spaniels require checks to prevent ear infections. The breed does have an inclination to gain weight easily, which can be prevented by controlling food intake. The Russian Spaniel can be prone to food allergies, which are usually identified at between 1 and 5 months of age with the most common allergens being chicken and carrots. There are no other breed-specific health issues currently known.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nIt is an energetic, free-spirited breed. Even though it is a gundog, it is also kept as a companion dog because of its easy-going nature and devotion to the cause. It is a cheerful, active dog and is always ready to play, responding to any form of attention with a happily wagging tail. Russian Spaniels are trainable, can make a good watchdog, and are amiable with children.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Russian Spaniel is the youngest of the Russian gundogs. It originated mostly from English Cocker Spaniels and English Springer Spaniels. Breeds known as Russian Spaniels have been mentioned as early as 1891 in New Zealand.The first recorded spaniel in Russia was a black Cocker Spaniel owned by hunting enthusiast Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich towards the end of the 19th century. Because of its noble connections, spaniels of various breeds were imported to St. Petersburg and Moscow. Some were used for hunting, but the smaller spaniels were not of much use in Russian bird hunting due to the weather and terrain conditions. It was at the beginning of the 20th century that selective breeding began for longer legged spaniels; specifically importing Springer Spaniels to create a rather mixed Russian Spaniel.By the late 1930s there were a variety of spaniels in Moscow, Leningrad and Sverdlovsk that did not fit any specific spaniel breed standard, but were not yet standardised into the modern Russian Spaniel. Purposeful breeding after World War II led to the original Russian Spaniel standard in 1951. Further revised standards were issued in 1966 and 2000.The popularity of the breed in Russia increased after the early 1990s, with Moscow dog shows since that time annually including between 120 and 131 Russian Spaniels, which qualifies the breed as one of the most popular, along with the Irish Setter. In 2002, the Russian Spaniel Club was set up in the United States to increase the knowledge of the breed outside Russia and to enable owners to register their dogs.\n\n\n== International recognition ==\nAlthough not recognised by any major kennel clubs, the Russian Spaniel is recognised by the Continental Kennel Club, Federation of International Canines, North American Kennel Club, and Universal Kennel Club International. For recognition by The Kennel Club a breed is required to apply with names and addresses of UK owners/importers, number of dogs bred in the UK, copies of the pedigrees of UK dogs - at least three generations, it must be recognised in its country of origin and statistics on registration figures in that country, statistics on entries in shows in that country and at international level, any inherited health conditions, when the breed registry was closed, the standard from the country of origin and a brief history and details of any working activities.In order to become recognised fully by the American Kennel Club, they must first compete in a Miscellaneous Class. The requirements to compete in that class are to demonstrate a following by having a minimum of 100 active members in a national breed club, a population of 300 to 400 dogs, with third generation pedigrees and for all dogs in those pedigrees to be of the same breed, a distribution across twenty or more states, and the breed standard must be reviewed and approved by the AKC. Currently there are five dogs in the AKC's Miscellaneous Class which are Dogue de Bordeaux, Redbone Coonhound, Irish Red and White Setter, Norwegian Buhund and Pyrenean Shepherd. Typical stays in that class are between one and three years, and the national club of the breed must have held seminars, shows and judges workshops prior to being fully recognised.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nA Russian Spaniel flushing out birds in the field"}, {"id": 410, "name": "Russkiy Toy", "country": "Russia", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog410", "description": "The Russian Toy (also known as the Russian Toy Terrier, and in Russia as the Russkiy Toy, Toychik,Russian: \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u043e\u0439, \u0422\u043e\u0439\u0447\u0438\u043a) is a very small breed of dog originally bred in Russia from the English Toy Terrier. There are two types of coats in the breed: smooth coat and long coat. The smooth-coated variety was previously known as the Russian Toy Terrier and long-coated as the Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier. Both were brought together under the same Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988 and the \"Terrier\" was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale and has been registered in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since 2008, allowed to compete in AKC companion events since 2010. The first official breed standard of the two varieties was written in 1966 in Russia.The breed was nearly wiped out twice; first in the 1920s with the rise of Communism due to the toy dog's traditional link to the aristocracy and again in the 1990s with the influx of foreign breeds following the fall of the Iron Curtain. The smooth coat type is the older of the two, with the long coat type first appearing in 1958.\nUntil the 1990s, the breed was almost unknown outside of Russia, and so relatively few details on associated health issues are known. The Russian Toy was originally bred as a rat fighter and as a watchdog, and can still exhibit the vocalization expected from the latter. It is a friendly dog and can become very attached to the family unit. Due to its size and similarities to the chihuahua, the two are often compared.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Russian Toy is one of the smallest breeds in the world, measuring between 20 cm and 28 cm and weighing anywhere between 1 kg and 3 kg. It has a small, distinctive head with large eyes and triangular ears. In countries where docking is prohibited, the tail is curved in the shape of a sickle. There are two types in the breed, distinguished by their coats; one is long-coated and the other smooth-coated. The smooth-coated dog has a short, shiny, close-lying coat. The long-coated variety has a longer coat and profuse feathering in the ears, legs and tail. The feathering or \"fringe\" on the ears is usually 3 to 5 cm long, can be straight or with a slight wave. It will be grown by the age of three and should completely cover the outer edges and tips of the ears.The smooth coat type of the breed closely resembles the Pra\u017esk\u00fd Krysa\u0159\u00edk breed of the Czech Republic. The Pra\u017esk\u00fd on average is a little shorter on leg and a little heavier than the Russian Toy.\nBoth of the Russian Toy varieties can be crossed and produce smooth- and long-coated puppies from the same litter. In addition, when two smooth-coated dogs are bred together, they may occasionally bear a long-coated offspring if the long hair gene is present in their pedigrees. However, there have been no records of two long-coated Russian Toys breeding together and producing smooth-coated offspring.\nThe breed has four main colors: black and tan, blue and tan, brown and tan, solid red of various shades. Red includes sable (red where the tips of the hairs are black, known as overlay) and red sable (red with brown overlay).\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nA Russian Toy will often require the help of a veterinarian to remove any retained deciduous teeth (known as \"puppy teeth\" or \"baby teeth\") that fail to fall out and make way for the permanent teeth. Without this intervention, usually done under anesthetic, the baby and permanent teeth will occupy the same socket in the jaw, which can cause tartar deposits, tooth decay, gingivitis and periodontitis, and can lead to premature loss of teeth. Retained puppy teeth can also cause misalignment of the teeth.As with most breeds of dog, the Russian Toy can suffer from patellar luxation, which is where the knee cap slips out of place when the knee bends as the groove that normally holds it in place is too shallow. It is usually an inherited defect, which occurs during the development of the foetus and rarely by trauma.Russian Toys can suffer from bone fractures due to their small and sometimes delicate nature.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nActive and cheerful, the Russian Toy was originally bred both as an anti-rat dog and a watch dog. The second quality is still active in the breed, and they can be very vocal. They can become quite attached to their family, regardless of the ages of the family members. Russian Toys are usually very reserved with strangers, but very loyal to their owners, always ready to protect them from any perceived danger.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first evidence of English-style terriers in Russia can be seen in the Museum of Zoology in Saint Petersburg. On display is an English style terrier dated 1716\u20131726 with a sign that reads \"This dog is a short hair terrier named Lizetta. It personally belonged to the Russian Emperor Peter the Great.\" Indeed, the breed was developed as a companion dog for Russian nobility. According to some accounts, records indicate that eight smooth-coated Russian Toys competed in a dog show in Saint Petersburg as far back as 1874. The more generally accepted first reference to the breed appears in May 1907 when 11 Russian Toys were shown at an exhibition in Saint Petersburg. In 1923, two dogs appeared at a Moscow dog show and in 1924, three more were awarded medals at a show in Odessa. But as a result of the October Revolution, the Russian Toy diminished in popularity and in numbers as these types of dogs were closely linked to the aristocracy and therefore frowned upon. In 1947, only one dog was shown in Saint Petersburg. When breeding began to revitalize the stock of Russian Toys in Russia, only a few of the dogs left had pedigrees or were purebred.The lack of numbers and political isolation of the country at the time caused the creation of a new breed quite distinct from the former English style toy dog as breeders sought to stabilise the remaining toy sized terriers into a standard breed. The resulting contemporary Russian Toy has most of the features of the classic toy terrier, with the addition of some new characteristics. The head is high but not wide, the cheeks are flat and the eyes are round. By 1960, 76 dogs were entered into an exhibition and the first standard for the two Russian Toy varieties was written in 1966 and authorized by the Ministry of Agriculture.In 1988, the Russian Kynological Federation published a new breed standard, combining the short-coated Russian Toy Terrier and the long-coated Moscow Toy Terrier under \"Russian Toy Terrier.\" However, after the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, the popularity of imported exotic breeds nearly drove the Russian Toy into extinction. A resurgence occurred thanks to a new energetic generation of dog breeders, but the breed remained virtually unknown outside of Russia until the 1990s. Several kennels have now been established outside Russia, the most successful ones located in Finland, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine and Czech Republic. Interest in the breed is on the rise in the USA and Japan.\nThe Russian Toy was provisionally recognised by the Federation Cynologique Internationale in 2006 and is expected to gain definitive recognition in 2016.The United Kennel Club and The Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club both accepted the breed in 2008 Russian Toys are also recognized by the American Rare Breed Association and International All Breed Canine Association.\n\n\n=== Development of the long-coated Russian Toy ===\n\nThe original long-coated Russian Toy is arguably a dog named Chikki born on 12 October 1958 to two smooth-coated dogs that both had slightly longer hair than was typical. Initially, the puppy was not to be registered as its coat was too long meet the breed standard, and usually such dogs would not participate in breeding programs and would often be put down. Chikki, however, was registered with a pedigree and purchased by Evgeniya Fominichna Zharova. Zharova is thus the long-coated variety's founding breeder as the first breeder to intentionally retain and breed a dog with a longer coat. Chikki developed an ear fringe and was mated with a female named Irma, who also had a longer coat than most smooth-coated dogs, and together they produced a litter of three long-coated puppies. Zharova developed the breed in Moscow, and so it came to be known as the Moscow Toy Terrier. The breed made its first appearance at a dog show in 1964 and the standard was set in 1966. Ten years after Chikki's birth, between 1968 and 1969, approximately 300 long-coated dogs were registered \u2013 a significant number considering that Russian Toy litters tend to be small, typically one to three puppies. Today, the long-coated variety has an established presence in Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, the Ukraine and a number of other countries, but the breeding program is particularly strong in Finland.The first Russian Toy was brought to Finland in 1988 when a long-coated male named Black-Champion-Bonaparte was imported from Russia and registered by Sirpa Lehtinen under Kennel Jojamint's. A female named Ste-Shihu was brought later that same year from Estonia by the same owner, and the two produced Finland's first Russian Toy litter (Jojamint's Agostini and Jojamint's Alboreto) also in 1988. Black-Champion-Bonaparte and Ste-Shihu were the first Russian Toys to appear in a dog show in Finland in 1989.\n\n\n== American Kennel Club history ==\n\nThe Foundation Stock Service (FSS) of the American Kennel Club (AKC) accepted the Russian Toy into its records in August 2008, and in July 2009, the Russian Toy was approved to compete in AKC companion events from 1 January 2010 onwards. Russian Toys can also be shown and earn Certificate of Merit Points at FSS Open shows.In 2008, the AKC board and FSS also acknowledged the Russian Toy Club of America (RTCA). The following year, the AKC board and FSS acknowledged Russian Toy Dog Club of America, Inc. (RTDCA).In 2010 this second club, RTDCA, decided to become the National Club for the Russian Toy breed in the United Kennel Club (UKC), where it became known as the Russkiy Toy Dog Club of America, Inc. (RTDCA). In 2013, the RTDCA was asked by AKC to separate into two distinct clubs with different officers to form two independent clubs: one to represent the AKC club and the other to represent the UKC Club. The AKC Russian Toy Dog Club of America added the word \"The\" to their name and became The Russian Toy Dog Club of America (TRTDCA) while the UKC club retained the original Russkiy Toy Dog Club of America name (RTDCA).In August 2013, AKC stated that the two clubs RTCA and TRTDCA must combine into one club to represent the Russian Toy breed in the AKC.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nF\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale\nAmerican Kennel Club\nRussian Toy Club of America, Inc.

It is uncertain when precisely the breed ceased to exist; it could still be found in the late 1800s. The Tracker was of Asiatic Russian origin. It was used for hundreds of years to protect and herd the flocks of the Indo-Aryan people in the wind-beaten, snow-swept Caucasus Mountains. \nThe Tracker was a large dog, sometimes standing as high as 30 inches (76 cm) at the shoulder and weighing 100 pounds (45 kg) or more. Despite its seemingly cumbersome proportions, it was fast and flexible enough to chase off wolves and other such predators that threatened its sheep. It wore a thick, taffy colored double-coat that protected it from both the harsh weather and the savage wildlife. Aside from its physical prowess, this mountain dog also had exceptional intellect. It was so wise and capable (legend says) that it could keep itself and its flock alive and well for months on end with no human help.The breed is related to on some level, and may be synonymous with, the Yellow Russian Retriever, which measured 28 inches (71 cm) and 90 pounds (41 kg).   That breed was reputed to be used for tracking wounded deer. The Tracker's closest surviving descendent is the Golden Retriever; however, the Flat-coated Retriever and a few of the Setters are also believed to carry Tracker blood.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Further reading ===\nMason, Walter Esplin (1867- ) (1915).

The breed was derived from Jack Russell's working terrier strains that were used in the 19th century for fox hunting. Russell's fox working strains were much smaller than the Show Fox Terrier and remained working terriers. The size of the Russell Terrier (10\u2033 to 12\u2033) combined with a small flexible, spannable chest makes it an ideal size to work efficiently underground. Their unique rectangular body shape with the body being of slightly longer length than the leg makes them distinctly different from the Parson Russell Terrier and the JRTCA Jack Russell Terrier.\nThe Russell Terrier originated in England, but the country of development was Australia.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe name Jack Russell Terrier was never used to describe a breed of dog. Rather, it became a common name for any predominantly-white earth-working terrier after the death of the clergyman Jack Russell. The only requisite was color, the instinct combined with the will to employ earth-work, and the size to work efficiently underground. Still today, the name is widely used for working terriers of the Parsons Reverend's style. It was in the country of development, Australia, that this 10-12 inch dog was first standardized by Kennel Club recognition with the official name \"Jack Russell Terrier\" applied to the breed. This ultimately led to recognition of the breed by FCI (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale) countries including Ireland and most recently the USA. Unfortunately, due to the previous use of the name in the USA and England, the name Jack Russell Terrier is conflicting. In the USA, a Terrier conforming to the Australian/FCI standard is simply called a Russell Terrier.\nThe Russell Terrier is a very popular companion breed in the US. First and foremost the breed is a working breed not a companion breed. They are bred by dedicated fanciers to preserve their working functional conformation and the instinct to employ their original purpose as earth terriers. This makes them an excellent performance breed participating in a variety of events; natural hunting which includes earthwork, agility, rally, obedience, tracking, go-to-ground, and conformation, just to name a few. They are also found as therapy and service dogs.\n\n\n=== Breed development in England and Australia ===\nIn the early 1970s, the Jack Russell Terrier Club of Great Britain was formed, and this body instituted a very primitive form of registration. Soon, Jack Russell Terrier Clubs were being formed worldwide, including Australia. The Jack Russell Terrier Club of Australia was formed in 1972. This national organization set up a particularly comprehensive registration system, along with a formal breed standard. This club also initiated discussions with their KC regarding the possibility of the breed being accepted for registration as a pure breed. The ideal height for the Jack Russell Terrier in Australia was to be 10\u2033 to 12\u2033.\n\n\n=== The Russell Terrier in the US ===\nThe Russell Terrier, also known as the FCI type Jack Russell Terrier is a recognized Kennel Club breed and is maintained separately from the AKC Parson Russell Terrier, and the UKC Parson Russell Terrier. In 2001, the United Kennel Club accepted the application from the English Jack Russell Terrier Club to give dogs in their registry the official \"FS\" designation. UKC officially recognized the breed as the Russell Terrier because the name Jack Russell Terrier was already in use for the longer legged dog in 2001. The UKC breed standard was changed in 2005 from the original standard of 2001. In 2009 the UKC changed the name to Jack Russell to go back to their original standard and aligning themselves with the rest of the world. The American Kennel Club AKC accepted the breed into the FSS Program on December 8, 2004 based on the F.C.I. Jack Russell standard also submitted by the E.J.R.T.C. aka the American Russell Terrier Club. The American Rare Breed Association recognized the \"Russell Terrier\" in 2003, with the old UKC standard originally written by the UKC. This standard was based on the same standard written by Australia and used also in Ireland. The Australian National Kennel Council recognized the breed in 1990. The original ARBA standard was then changed by the NRTFC to a new standard and different standard in November 2008, than again on January 1, 2010. The AKC parent club for the Russell Terrier changed the F C I breed standard in 2010 and introduced their own standard which is now different from the rest of the world and F C I. The NRTFC was the first and is the only organization in the world and history of the breed, to recognize only the Smooth coated dog and create a history different from the rest of the world. \nThe FCI Jack Russell Terrier was accepted into the AKC FSS known as the \"Russell Terrier\" in December 2004 on the application submitted by the ARTC. using the FCI standard. The Parson Russell Terrier, Hunt Terrier and the Jack Russell Terrier/Russell Terrier (Australian/FCI JRT) will forever be linked in ancestry.  However, after 15 years of maintaining the Russell Terrier in the US and longer internationally as a distinctly separate breed with the selection of the rectangular appearance unique only to the Jack Russell/Russell Terrier they can no longer be considered variations.\n\n\n=== More ===\n\nThe breed originated in England and was developed in Australia with a well-documented history. The history of the breed detailed in the standard is as important as the definition of the description of the Russells. The AKC Parson Russell Terrier and the AKC FSS Russell Terrier are maintained as distinctly separate breeds in AKC and in Europe.\nThe American Russell Terrier Club in October 2007 was designated the AKC Parent Club. On January 1, 2010 the AKC Russell Terrier moved forward into the Misc. Class. The AKC FSS books are still open and 2 of the 3 clubs listed on the AKC website are still accepting registrations for the Russell Terrier. The AKC breed standard and other information regarding the breed can be found here:The American Russell Terrier Foundation Club is a recognized Russell Terrier registry for single dog registration for FSS AKC.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJack Russell Terrier Club of America\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBurns, Patrick. \"American Working Terriers\". 2005.

Although he was passionate about the German Shepherd, he found most dogs to be too domesticated and wanted to breed in more natural properties in order to get better working dogs. The result was not entirely what Saarloos had hoped for. This breed is cautious, reserved and lacks the ferocity to attack. Until Leendert Saarloos died in 1969, he was in full control over the breeding of his \"European wolfdog\". The Dutch Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1975. To honour its creator, they changed the name to \"Saarloos Wolfdog\". In 1981, the breed was recognized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI). In the past, some Saarloos wolfdogs were trained as guide dogs for the blind and as rescue dogs, but most dogs of this breed are currently simply kept as companions.\n\n\n== Genetics ==\nIn 2015, a study found that the Saarloos wolfdog showed more genetic association with the gray wolf than any other breed, which is in agreement with the documented historical crossbreeding with gray wolves in this breed. In 2016, a major DNA study of domestic dogs found a deep division between the Saarloos wolfdog and all other dogs, highlighting its descent from the crossing of German Shepherds with captive wolves in the 1930s, then followed by a further split between dogs of Eastern Eurasian and Western Eurasian origin.\n\n\n== Size and appearance ==\nThe Saarloos wolfdog is a fairly large dog, up to 76 cm (30 in) at the shoulder and weighing up to 45 kg (100 lb). It is an athletic dog in build, with medium bone, and a strong and muscular body. They move lightly on their feet and have an elegant march. Its coat is short and dense, providing good protection from the weather. There are three colours: wolf-grey, red and white. Because the wolf-grey genes are dominant, this is the most common colour. Genes for white colour are recessive, making this uncommon although this colour is accepted. The Saarloos has wolf-like expressions, as well as a wolf-like head.\n\n\n== Training ==\nThis breed needs thorough socialization before the twelfth week of age to ensure prosocial behavior.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCzechoslovakian Wolfdog\nTamaskan Dog\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSaarloos wolfdog at Curlie"}, {"id": 415, "name": "Sabueso Espa\u00f1ol", "country": "Spain", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog415", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 416, "name": "Colombian fino hound", "country": "Colombia", "type": "", "picture": "dog416", "description": "The Colombian fino hound (Sabueso fino Colombiano)  is a typical dog breed from Colombia,  the hunting dog of  Colombian peasants, distributed throughout the country with a traceable history for over 200 years, was selected by  functionality and adaptability to the Colombian landscape.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe fino hound is a beautiful scenthound, with  magnificent sense of smell, body with rectangular proportion of medium size, with a height at withers that varies between 45 and 55 cm, almond eyes, long ears and scissor bite .

Due to their ability as hunters, they became popular with all the social classes from Presidents of the Republic and the upper class because of their interest in hunting and sporting events, to the farmers and humble classes as they were used to hunt in order to find food.\nDue to geographic isolation suffered by the country over its history, it has been led to a great diversity of hounds still preserved and used for hunting of Lowland paca and others rodents.

The short-coated variety comprises two types of coat. The variety which has been developed and used in areas of the country with hot weather have a short, straight, shiny coat.  This is a single coat especially on the head and ears. The variety which come from the colder areas of the country has an undercoat which presents a denser appearance. The rough (bearded) variety: Harsh coat, rough and they have a slight beard and hair which is somewhat longer on their legs.

The breed has origins dating back to at least the 16th century, but was nearly extinct by the end of World War II. Through the efforts of Father Robert Billard, the breed was resurrected during the second half of the 20th century; its national breed club was founded in 1990. The breed was recognised by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine (French Kennel Club) in 2003.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of this breed can be traced to the 16th century, however by the mid 20th century it had nearly become extinct. Following World War II, Robert Billard, a priest, was given a parish in Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire in the Bresse region of France. Billard was an active hunter and began to search for a suitable hunting dog. He was told of a local dog breed known as the \"Epagneul de Saint-Usuge\", and contacted the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine in order to find what happened to the breed.Father Billard found that the last recording of the Saint-Usuge Spaniel was in a dog show in 1936 in the nearby town of Louhans, and he located  the breed standard from that show. He proceeded to visit the hunters in his parish until he found a dog which matched the breed description, a female named Poupette.In 1950 he found a male spaniel named Dick, who was a son of Braco, the dog which won best in show at the show in 1936. He continued to find other male dogs around the region to include in the reconstruction of the breed. In 1962, a Small M\u00fcnsterl\u00e4nder female named Bianca von der Rumerburg was used in the breeding programme, chosen as that breed's standards mostly closely resemble the Saint-Usuge's. In 1980, the work on reconstructing the breed was handed over to Serge Bey, a local conservationist. Father Billard's breeding programme bred nearly 250 dogs over a 33 year period.The national breed club for France was set up in 1990 and known as the Club de l'Epagneul de Saint-Usuge. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale Canine recognised the Saint Usuge Spaniel on January 8, 2003, placing it within Group 7 with other continental spaniels. While the breed is not fully recognised by the American Kennel Club,  it is listed as a breed in the club's companion animal recovery scheme.\n\n\n== Description ==\nIt is a small French pointing breed, measuring 16\u201321 inches (41\u201353 cm) at the withers according to the breed standard. They have a typical spaniel appearance, with ears that are located below the eyeline that have fringes long enough to reach the tip of the nose. The body should be well muscled with a broad, deep chest. The only color that the coat comes in is brown, but it may have white markings including a white \"star\" on the forehead, which some dogs can lose as their adult coat grows in. In addition to the ears; the tail, shoulders and chest should also be fringed with fur. The tail of the Saint Usuge is never docked, and should be long and curved. \n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nDescribed by its French breed club as easy to train, it is an obedient, passionate and affectionate breed. In the field it is suited to a variety of terrains, including swamps, water and thickets; quarry that the breed specialises in includes waterfowl and woodcock.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Club de l'\u00e9pagneul de Saint-Usuge\" (in French).\n\"Club Epagneul de Saint Usuge\" (in German)."}, {"id": 418, "name": "Sakhalin Husky", "country": "Japan", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog418", "description": "The Sakhalin Husky, also known as the Karafuto-Ken (\u6a3a\u592a\u72ac), is a breed of dog formerly used as a sled dog but now nearly extinct.As of 2011, there were only two surviving purebred members of the breed in Japan. The sole remaining breeder, Sergey Lyubykh, located in the Nivkh village of Nekrasovka, died in 2012, but before his death stated that there were no longer enough living specimens of the breed to allow for the genetic diversity necessary for continued breeding.\n\n\n== History ==\nKarafuto-ken breaks down as Karafuto, the Japanese name for Sakhalin and Ken, a Japanese word for dog; hence, this provides the breed's geographical origin.  This breed is used rarely now; therefore, few breeders remain in Japan.\nExplorers who went to Franz Josef Land, conquerors of northern Alaska, and South Pole explorers (including Robert Falcon Scott) used these dogs.  They were utilized by the Red Army during World War II as pack animals; but that affair was short-lived after research proved that they were prodigious eaters of salmon, and not worth keeping.Offshoots of the Sakhalin Husky are theorized to be progenitors of longer-coated Akitas.\n\n\n=== Antarctic expedition ===\nThis breed's claim to fame came from the ill-fated 1958 Japanese research expedition to Antarctica, which made an emergency evacuation, leaving behind 15 sled dogs.  The researchers believed that a relief team would arrive within a few days, so they left the dogs chained up outside with a small supply of food; however, the weather turned bad and the team never made it to the outpost.\nIncredibly, nearly one year later, a new expedition arrived and discovered that two of the dogs, Taro and Jiro, had survived and they became instant heroes.  Taro returned to Sapporo, Japan and lived at Hokkaido University until his death in 1970, after which he was stuffed and put on display at the university's museum.  Jiro died in Antarctica in 1960 of natural causes and the remains are located at the National Science Museum of Japan in Ueno Park.\nThe breed spiked in popularity upon the release of the 1983 film Nankyoku Monogatari, about Taro and Jiro. A second 2006 film, Eight Below, provided a fictional version of the occurrence, but did not reference the breed. Instead, the film features only eight dogs: two Alaskan Malamutes and six Siberian Huskies. In 2011, TBS presented the much-awaited drama, Nankyoku Tairiku, featuring Kimura Takuya. It tells the story of the 1957 Antarctica Expedition led by Japan and their Sakhalin Huskies.\nThe breed and the expedition are memorialized by three monuments: near Wakkanai, Hokkaido; under Tokyo Tower; and near Nagoya Port.  Sculptor Takeshi Ando designed the Tokyo statues (he also designed Hachik\u014d's statute in front of JR Shibuya Station), which were removed, likely to be placed at Tokyo's National Institute of Polar Research.\n\n\n== The Sakhalin Huskies of the 1957-1958 Japanese expedition ==\nFew sources provide the names of the fifteen Japanese sled dogs that were stranded, as well as the photos and descriptions of the huskies. The names of the dogs are listed here:\n\nRiki: Seven-year-old male with light gray coat and white markings, leader of the team.

The dog was originally bred in the Fertile Crescent. The modern breed is typically deep-chested and long-legged, and similar dogs appear in medieval and ancient art.  The breed is most closely related to the Afghan hound, a basal breed that predates the emergence of modern breeds in the 19th Century,, and the Saluki has been purebred both in the Middle East, including by royalty, since at least that era, and in the West (especially in Britain and Germany) since the 1840s (with breed standards established in the West and the Middle East around the 1920s\u20131930s), though as a free-breeding landrace, similar dogs are common as feral animals in the Middle East. A related standardised breed is the Sloughi, a variant of the same name (itself of unclear origin).\n\n\n== Name ==\nOne suggested origin of the breed's name is ancient Sumerian salu-ki translating to 'plunge-earth'. However, there is no evidence a breed existed then or was referred to by the Sumerians with this name, nor is it certain what \"plunge [to/into] earth\" might have meant in reference to dogs. It is suggestive of digging for burrowing prey animals, but there is also a story see below) of dogs being thrown toward quarry animals by a camel-mounted hunter.\nThe name used for the modern breed could be derived from Saluqiyyah, the Arabic form of Seleucia, appearing in pre-Islamic Arabic poetry. However, this is disputed. British diplomat Terence Clark wrote that the Arabic word saluqi indicates 'person or thing from a place named Saluq'. Arab tradition states that Saluq was an ancient town in Yemen not far from modern Ta'izz, and the Arabs associate this town with the origin of the breed. However, the word saluqi might have been derived from reference to several other places: Saluq in Armenia, and three towns called Saluqiyah. One has become modern Silifke (Turkey), another is near Antioch (modern Antakya, Turkey), and third is located near Baghdad (Iraq). Baghdad eclipsed Ctesiphon, the capital of the Persian Empire, which was located some 30 km (19 mi) to the southeast. Ctesiphon itself had replaced and absorbed Seleucia, the first capital of the Seleucid Empire (312 BCE \u2013 65 CE)\nRegardless, the adjective saluqi may have been derived by the Arabs of the Arabian Peninsula from the similar-sounding word for Seleucid used in the Aramaic and Syriac languages spoken there by the various peoples of that part of Mesopotamia, but there is no irrefutable evidence.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSalukis are sighthounds \u2013 hunting by sight more than scent or sound \u2013 and run their quarry down to kill or retrieve it. The normal size range for the modern breed is 23\u201328 inches (58\u201371 cm) high at the withers and 40\u201360 pounds (18\u201327 kg) in weight. Female Salukis are slightly smaller than males. The head is long and narrow with large eyes and drop ears. The tail of the breed is long and curved. It has the typical deep-chested, long-legged body of sighthounds. The coat comes in a variety of colors including white, cream, fawn, red, grizzle/tan, black/tan, and tri-color (white, black and tan).\n \nThe overall appearance of the Saluki is grace and symmetry. Two coat types \u2013 smooth and \"feathered\" \u2013 are evident in the breed's gene pool. The latter variety has light fluffing on the back of the legs, thighs, ears, and sometimes the throat. The fur on both types is silky and is low-shedding when compared to other breeds. Salukis bred in the Middle East most commonly have short hair.\nThere is a type called \"desert Saluki\", which descends from bloodlines brought directly from the original region of the breed. It exists in the entire Middle Eastern region. In Israel the type is known as the \"Negev Saluki\". The desert Saluki does not have influence of western lines and it tends to have a more primitive appearance. It often has a broader skull, shorter muzzle, shorter and more compact body, broader chest, less angulations, and shorter tail than the western equivalent. Some desert Salukis imported from the original region have cropped ears because this is a common tradition in countries such as Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Syria. However, it is difficult to strictly determine what desert Salukis are because even when the dogs with \"original\" bloodlines have been bred in the western world for 4 to 5 generations, many people start to call them \"western\". The type existed in the US already in the 1980's and there has been breeding in France in the 1990's. The first desert Salukis in Finland were imported from Israel in February 2000. After that, more have been imported from countries such as Syria, Oman, Qatar, Turkey. In addition to their countries of born, they have for example Iranian, Moroccan, Bahrainian, and Saudi Arabian (so-called \"beduin Salukis\") dogs in their background.\n\n\n== Swiftness and physical capacity ==\nWhile the Greyhound is credited as being the fastest dog breed up to distances of around 800 metres (2,600 ft), both the Saluki and Whippet breeds are thought to be faster over longer distances. In 1996, The Guinness Book of Records listed a Saluki as being the fastest dog, capable of reaching a speed of 68.8 km/h (42.8 mph). Due to its heavily padded feet being able to absorb the impact on its body, the Saluki has remarkable stamina when running.Historically, the ancestors of the modern Saluki breed were used for hunting by nomadic tribes. Typical quarry included the gazelle, hare, fox and jackal. While hunting hares, Bedouin hunters would sometimes ride close to their quarry on a camel holding such a dog, which would be thrown towards the prey while at speed to give the dog a running start. Gazelle hunters also used hawks to gouge out the eyes of the prey so that a saluki could then bring down the blinded animal.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe modern Saluki has retained qualities of hunting hounds and may seem reserved to strangers. The often independent and aloof breed may be difficult to train, and they generally cannot be trusted to return to their owner when off-leash. Training methods have been recommended to be always gentle and patient. Salukis may bore easily and are not an ideal breed to leave unattended for long periods; however, they are well-suited to life in apartments, since they are generally quiet and calm as adults. The saluki does not typically enjoy rough games or activities such as retrieving balls, but does enjoy soft toys. Early socialisation will help prevent timidity and shyness in later life. Given its hunting instincts, the dog is prone to chasing moving objects, such as cats, birds, squirrels, and bugs.\n\n\n== Health ==\nHip dysplasia is uncommon in Salukis, with the breed ranking joint lowest in a survey by the British Veterinary Association in 2003. The breed scored an average of 5 points, with a score of 0 being low, while 106 is high. In a 2006 breed specific survey conducted by The Kennel Club and the British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee, responses highlighted several health issues. The primary cause of death identified was that of cancer, being responsible for 35.6% of deaths, with the most common forms being that of liver cancer or lymphoma. The secondary cause of death was cardiac related, with forms such as heart failure, or unspecified heart defects. Old age is listed as the third most frequent cause of death.Cardiomyopathy, heart murmur, and other cardiac issues were present in 17.2% of responses while dermatolic conditions such as dermatitis or alopecia were reported by 10.8% of responses. Salukis have an average lifespan of 12 to 14 years, which is similar to other breeds of their size.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Saluki's ancestors were historically bred in the Fertile Crescent, where agriculture originated. Images of running dogs with long, narrow bodies adorn pottery found in Susa, southwest Iran that dates back to 6,000 years ago.  despite the depictions bearing erect, pointed ears. Dogs that look similar to Salukis and Greyhounds were increasingly depicted on Egyptian tombs from the Middle Kingdom (2134 BC\u20131785 BC) onward, however it was during the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt that Salukis-like dogs rose to prominence, replacing dogs called tesem (thought to be similar to modern pariah dogs or a generic term for a dog) in ancient Egyptian art. The variety spread southward into the Sudan.\n\nFrom Iran, such dogs are mentioned in the poetry of Khaghani (1121\u20131190), depicted in miniature paintings of hunting scenes along with horseback archers by Master Kam\u0101l ud-D\u012bn Behz\u0101d (1450\u20131535), depicted in book illustrations by 'Abd al-Wahhab ibn 'Abd al-Fattah ibn 'Ali (1516), and in metal-smithing from the reign of the Injuid prince, Jamal al Dine Abu Is'haq, created between 1342\u20131353. One of the more outstanding pieces of sculpture in Iran is the Savashi Canyon Relief, carved around 1800, that was commissioned by Shar Fath-Ali Shah Qajar to commemorate his hunting exploits.The Silk Road was a trading route that stretched from ancient Iran to China. From China, examples of dogs that look like Salukis were painted by the fifth Ming Emperor Zh\u016b Zh\u0101nj\u012b, known more commonly as the Xuande Emperor during the Ming Dynasty (1368\u20131644). The inscription on the painting reads \"playfully painted [by the] imperial brush\" in 1427. Additional red seals were added in later years by owners of the painting, which also reveals that the painting was in the Imperial Chinese collection in the 18th century.From Europe, the legend maintains that the returning crusaders brought the Saluki-type dogs from the Middle East. The painting of Henry IV, Duke of Saxony with his hunting dog, painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder in 1514, shows a dog thought by some to represent an ancestral Saluki. The dog wears a collar decorated with a scallop shell, which is the badge of a pilgrim who has traveled the Way of Saint James in Spain. Saluki-type dogs appear in Paolo Veronese's 1573 work The Adoration of the Magi (also known as the Adoration of the Kings), currently located at the National Gallery, London. Veronese painted such dogs in another two of his religious paintings: The Marriage at Cana and The Finding of Moses.Sheik Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa, King of Bahrain during the 1930s, was known for a pack of Salukis that accompanied him throughout the Arab world on hunting trips. Following his death, his son Salman ibn Hamad Al Khalifa attempted to keep the lines pure-bred but they became interbred with other breeds. However, the pure-bred lines of the royal kennel were saved by the efforts of Dana Al Khalifa who was given two pure-bred puppies by the King, and about a decade later had pure-bred Salukis registered with the Kennel Club of Bahrain. Today, the breed is still held in high regard throughout the Middle East and were hunting dogs for nobles and rulers around the region. They are considered clean by the Bedouins, and are allowed to be in women's quarters, while other dogs must be kept outside.In 2014, a DNA study compared dogs and wolves for AMY2B (alpha amylase 2B), which is a gene and enzyme that assists with the first step in the digestion of dietary starch and glycogen. An expansion of this gene in dogs would enable early dogs to exploit a starch-rich diet as they fed on refuse from agriculture. Data indicated that the wolves and dingo had just two copies of the gene and the Siberian husky that is associated with hunter-gatherers had just 3\u20134 copies, \"whereas the saluki, which was historically bred in the Fertile Crescent where agriculture originated, has 29 copies\".\n\n\n=== Breeding in the West ===\n\nIt was not until 1840 that Salukis were first brought to England. Referred to as \"slughis\", they and the modern Sloughi were treated as the same breed; however, recent genetic tests have shown that the two breeds are genetically separate. The first successful modern breeding line of Salukis began in 1895, with Florence Amherst (daughter of the 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney). Having seen salukis on a Nile tour in that year, she imported a breeding pair from the Al Salihah area of Lower Egypt. A champion of breed purity, she struggled alone for nearly three decades, and real popularity of the Saluki in the Europe did not take hold until the early 1920s, when officers returning from the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I and from the Arab Revolt brought their pet Salukis home with them.One of these was Brigadier General Frederick Lance of the 19th Lancers, and his wife, Gladys, who returned to Britain with two Salukis from Sarona, Palestine, where he had been stationed during the post-war occupation. The Lances were both keen hunters, and rode with their pack of dogs, including both Salukis and terriers, to course jackal and Dorcas gazelle whilst stationed in the desert. They imported a male, named Sarona Kelb, who became an influence on the breed in the West.Together, the Lances with Florence Amherst mounted a campaign for recognition of the Middle Eastern breed, that coincided with the phenomenon of \"Tutmania\" caused by Howard Carter's discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb in late 1922. In 1923, the Saluki or Gazelle Hound Club was formed, and the Kennel Club granted official recognition to the breed. The first registered Salukis in the Western studbook were Cyrus and Slongha Peri, imported from Iran and registered with the German kennel club Deutscher Windhundzucht- und Rennverband (DWZRV). DWZRV also recorded the first litter born in the West in 1922.Imports to England during the interwar years were chiefly from areas of British military influence and commerce: Bahrain, Egypt, Transjordan, and Iraq. Both Florence Amherst and the Lances imported breeding stock from the latter two countries. Despite substantial populations of Salukis in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, none of these were imported to England.English Salukis (chiefly descendants of Sarona Kelb) were exported to many countries, but by the mid-1930s, interest slackened, and with the outbreak of World War II, breeding and show activities almost entirely stopped. The number of litters was minimal \u2013 just enough to keep the breed alive. Food rationing reserved all edible meat for humans, and to prevent the Salukis from dying from starvation or being killed by bombs, some owners euthanised entire kennels. A small number of Saluki kennels in the West survived the war, and along with fresh imports belonging to a second wave of soldiers returning from the Middle East, the slow process of re-establishing the breed began.Popularity of Salukis dramatically increased, and the Saluki Club of America was founded in 1927. Salukis were recognised by the Kennel Club (UK) in 1923, and by the American Kennel Club in 1929. The breed is also the mascot of Southern Illinois University Carbondale.\nThe popularity of the Saluki in the United States, according to the American Kennel Club, has remained relatively stable in the 2000s, with the breed ranked 107th in 1999, had decreased to 118th in 2008, but by 2008 had increased once again to 112th. Between 2000 and 2009, 1215 salukis were registered with The Kennel Club in the UK, while this does not approach the numbers of the more popular breeds, it is in line with similar breeds in the hound group such as the Borzoi, which had 1399 puppies registered in the same period. In September 2007, the Kennel Club Art Gallery's 12th exhibition, \"The Saluki in Art\", celebrated the breed, showing a range of exhibits including terracotta and bronze works, along with contemporary artists and a range of trophies from Saluki breed clubs.\n\n\n=== Rescue ===\nSalukis (or landrace dogs similar to them) are common throughout the Middle East, and are sometimes abandoned. Rescue organisations work with shelters in Qatar, Bahrain, and elsewhere, and directly with a network of rescuers in Kuwait to find the dogs adoptive homes in Europe and North America.  \n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGoodman, Gail (1995).

It is in the \"brown and black section\" in its family, the Spitz family.\n\n\n=== Ears ===\nSamoyed ears are thick and covered with fur, triangular in shape, and erect. They are almost always white but can often have a light to dark brown tint (known as \"biscuit\"), usually around the tips of the ears.\n\n\n=== Tail ===\nThe Samoyed tail is one of the breed's distinguishing features. Like the Alaskan Malamute, the tail is carried curled over the back; however, unlike the Malamute, the Samoyed tail is held actually touching the back. It should not be a tight curl or held flag-like; it should be carried lying over the back and to one side. In cold weather, Samoyeds may sleep with their tails over their noses to provide additional warmth. Almost all Samoyeds will allow their tails to fall when they are relaxed and at ease, as when being stroked or while eating, but will return their tails to a curl when more alert.\nNZKC Standard:\nTail:\nLong and profuse, carried over the back when alert; sometimes dropped when at rest.\nUK Kennel Club Standard :\nTail :\nLong and profusely coated, carried over the back and to the side when alert, sometimes dropped when at rest.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nSamoyeds have a dense, double layer coat. The topcoat contains long, coarse, and straight guard hairs, which appear white but have a hint of silver coloring. This top layer keeps the undercoat relatively clean and free of debris. The under layer, or undercoat, consists of a dense, soft, and short fur that keeps the dog warm. The undercoat typically sheds heavily once or twice a year, and this seasonal process is sometimes referred to as \"blowing coat\". This does not mean the Samoyed will shed only during that time however; fine hairs (versus the dense clumps shed during seasonal shedding) will be shed all year round, and have a tendency to stick to cloth and float in the air. The standard Samoyed may come in a mixture of biscuit and white coloring, although pure white and all biscuit dogs are common. Males typically have larger ruffs than females. While this breed is touted as \"hypoallergenic\", it does shed a fair amount and needs frequent grooming. While the breed may produce less allergens, care should be taken for severe allergies.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nSamoyeds' friendly disposition makes them poor guard dogs; an aggressive Samoyed is rare. The breed is characterized by an alert and happy expression which has earned the nicknames \"Sammie smile\" and \"smiley dog.\" With their tendency to bark, however, they can  be diligent watch dogs, barking whenever something approaches their territory. Samoyeds are excellent companions, especially for small children or even other dogs, and they remain playful into old age. According to the Samoyed Club of America, when Samoyeds become bored, they may begin to dig. With their sled dog heritage, a Samoyed is not averse to pulling things, and an untrained Samoyed has no problem pulling its owner on a leash rather than walking alongside. Samoyeds were also used to herd reindeer. They will instinctively act as herd dogs, and when playing with children, especially, will often attempt to turn and move them in a different direction.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nSamoyeds can compete in dog agility trials, carting, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, mushing and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Samoyeds exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n=== Genetic diversity ===\nThe Samoyed is a primitive dog belonging to the spitz or northern dog group, specifically the laikas: a Eurasian dog type used for a variety of purposes, namely hunting, herding, guarding, and sledding. The Samoyed is descended from the Nenets herding laika, a dog that comes in not only white, but also a wider variety of colors. Like many breeds, the Samoyed was bred from a small number of founders (in this case, from Siberia). The founder effect then led to a reduction in genetic diversity, which may explain why some Samoyeds today are affected by the genetic disorders below.\n\n\n=== Samoyed hereditary glomerulopathy ===\n\nThe breed can be affected by a genetic disease known as Samoyed hereditary glomerulopathy, a renal disease. The disease is known to be caused by an X-linked dominant faulty allele and therefore the disease is more severe in male Samoyeds. Also known as hereditary nephritis, it is caused by a nonsense mutation in codon 1027 of the COL4A5 gene on the X chromosome (glycine to stop codon), which is similar to Alport's syndrome in humans.\nCarrier females do develop mild symptoms after 2\u20133 months of age, but mostly do not go on to develop renal failure. The disease is caused by a defect in the structure of the type-IV collagen fibrils of the glomerular basement membrane. As a consequence, the collagen fibrils of the glomerular basement membrane are unable to form cross-links, so the structural integrity is weakened and the membrane is more susceptible to \"wear-and-tear\" damage. As the structure of the basement membrane begins to degenerate, plasma proteins are lost in the urine and symptoms begin to appear. Affected males appear healthy for the first three months of life, but then symptoms start to appear and worsen as the disease progresses: the dog becomes lethargic and muscle wastage occurs, as a result of proteinuria. From three months of age onwards, a reduced glomerular filtration rate is detected, indicative of progressive renal failure. Death from renal failure usually occurs by 15 months of age.Clinically, proteinuria is found in both sexes from the age of three to four months; in dogs older than this, renal failure in combination with more or less pronounced hearing loss occurs swiftly and death at the age of 8 to 15 months is expected. In heterozygous females, the disease develops slowly. The disease can be treated to slow down the development by use of cyclosporine A and ACE inhibitors, but not be stopped.If a carrier female is mated with a healthy stud dog, the female offspring have a 50% chance of being carriers for the disease, and any male offspring have a 50% chance of being affected by the disease. A genetic test is available for this disease.\n\n\n=== Other health concerns ===\n\nFor the Samoyeds in the veterinary literature several breed-specific hereditary diseases are described:\n\nDiabetes mellitus similar but not identical to human Type I (insulin deficiency): The disease occurs in middle-aged Samoyeds, the mean age at diagnosis is seven years. The cause is a chronic inflammation of the pancreas and / or autoimmune destruction of beta cells of islets of Langerhans. Moreover, in affected dogs autoantibodies were found to insulin. Currently, several genetic markers are discussed as possible causes.\nProgressive retinal atrophy (PRA) caused by a frameshift mutation in the RPRG locus of the X chromosome. The disease leads to a slowly progressive loss of vision, which eventually leads to blindness. The first symptoms appear between two and five years of age. The disease corresponds to the X-linked PRA type 3 in humans.\nShort legs in conjunction with eye abnormalities: Due to a genetic defect at the COL2A1 locus occurs on disproportionate dwarfism with short limbs in connection with cataracts, malformations of the retina and / or retinal detachment, liquefaction of the vitreous and a persistent hyaloid artery. The malformations of the retina are dominant (i.e. before coming in heterozygous dogs); the other symptoms are recessive, so they only come to expression in homozygous affected dogs. A connection with Opticin is not.\nPulmonary stenosis occurs more frequently in Samoyeds in comparison with other breeds. The disease can cause shortness of breath, cardiac arrhythmias and tiring on motion and increases the risk of congestive heart failure.\nHip dysplasia is also a concern for Samoyeds.\nThe breed can also be affected by sebaceous adenitis, an uncommon idiopathic autoimmune skin disease.\nLife expectancy is about 12\u201313 years.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Samoyed has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th Century. Samoyeds were originally used for hunting, herding reindeer, and hauling sledges for the Samoyede people in Siberia. Fridtjof Nansen believed that the use of sled dogs was the only effective way to explore the north and used Samoyeds on his polar expeditions.\n\n\n== Use of fur ==\n\nShed Samoyed fur is sometimes used as an alternative to wool in knitting, with a texture similar to angora. The fur is sometimes also used for the creation of artificial flies for fly fishing. Samoyed fur sweaters have been reported to handle temperatures well below freezing.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nKaifas and Suggen, the lead dogs for Fridtjof Nansen's North Pole expedition.\nSamoyeds serve as the sled dogs of Stone Fox in the children's novel Stone Fox.\nIn the manga Touch by Mitsuru Adachi, the main characters have a Samoyed named Punch.\nIn the manga and anime Maison Ikkoku by Rumiko Takahashi, Soichiro the dog is a Samoyed.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBernard, MA; Valli, VE (1977). \"Familial renal disease in Samoyed dogs\".

The word is followed in Korean by either gae (meaning \"dog\") or the suffix ee/i, but is most commonly romanized as \"Sapsaree\".  Traditionally, these dogs were believed to dispel ghosts and evil spirits.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Sapsaree, just like the Korean Jindo, was designated as a National Treasure (No.368) in 1992 by the Korean Government. The Sapsaree has been identified and recognized by both leading Korean dog societies, the Korean Canine Club (FCI affiliate) and the Korean Kennel Club.\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Sapsaree has been called a \"lion dog\" for its bulky and strong upper body and its large and imposing paws. Sapsarees are medium-sized and slightly tall. Their adult coat is long and abundant, and comes in various colors, including solid and/or mixed shades of black, golden yellowish-blonde, reddish-orange, browns, and salt-and-pepper greys.

After the collapse of Unified Silla, the Sapsaree breed became popular throughout the Korean Peninsula, appearing in classic Joseon-era literary works such as \"Chunhyangjeon\" and \"Yeolha Ilgi\". They were slaughtered in large numbers by the Japanese when Korea was under Japanese rule to make winter coats for its military in Manchuria.

The Schapendoes was originally a herding dog and general farm dog, but today also participates in dog sports such as agility and flyball.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Schapendoes descends from a general type of farm and herding dog popular in the Drenthe province of the Netherlands, and the Veluwe, an area of forests and swampland. (\"does\" is a local dialect meaning \"swamp\" see e.g. the town of Doesburg) The dogs there had many names, and were not a specific breed as we use the term today. They were the local working dog, adapted to the people, environment, and types of work needed. They were exhibited in early dog shows (in the 1870s) as Domestic herding dog.\nThe dogs became nearly extinct during World War II, and the modern day breed descends from the few survivors. The Dutch Raad van Beheer (national kennel club) first recognised the breed in 1952, and the first standard was written in 1954. Related breeds are the Bearded Collie, the Puli, the Polish Lowland Sheepdog (Owczarek Nizinny), the Old English Sheepdog, the Briard, the Bergamasco Shepherd (Cane da pastore Bergamasco) and the Old German Sheepdog (Schafspudel), all of which are small versions of the \"mountain type\" herding and livestock guardian dogs.The breed was recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1971, as breed number 313 in Group 1, Section 1: Sheepdogs. Exported to the North America, the breed is recognised by the Canadian Kennel Club (as Dutch Sheepdog) and the United Kennel Club (USA) in their respective Herding Groups. The American Kennel Club has listed the Schapendoes as part of its Foundation Stock Service, the first step in breed recognition. Additionally, it is recognised by numerous minor kennel clubs and internet-based dog registry businesses.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Schapendoes is a medium sized dog with long, thick fur on the body, legs, tail, and face. Small ears hang down, covered with long fur. The face has a moustache and beard. The coat is of any colour.\n\nHeight is up to 50 cm (19.7 in) at the withers and 12\u201320 kg (26\u201344 lb), up to 25 kg (55 lb) for males, in weight.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe breed standard describes the Schapendoes as friendly, high spirited, and affectionate. He is not a guard dog or aggressively protective, and if properly socialised while young, would most likely make a good family dog, as well as a good dog for active sports. Lively and intelligent dogs must receive regular training and outings. Temperament of individual dogs may vary.\nThe Schapendoes is furthermore very independent and cooperate with its trainer rather than obey orders.\n\n\n== Health ==\nHealth problems or claims of exceptional health have not been documented for this breed.

There has been a long informal debate over whether this type of dog is a spitz or miniature sheepdog. In their home country of Belgium they are considered a small shepherd.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nTheir small, pointed ears are erect atop the head. Schipperkes are double coated with a soft, fluffy undercoat that is covered by a harsher-feeling and longer outer coat.  One of the breed characteristics is a long ruff that surrounds the neck and then a strip trails down towards the rear of the dog.  They also have longer fur on their hind legs called culottes. The breed is black, or blonde (some blondes have a silkier coat), and the coat is shiny.\nDogs of this breed usually weigh 3\u20139 kg (6.6\u201319.8 lb).  Puppies are born with tails in different lengths. In Canada and the United States, the tail is usually docked the day after birth.  In countries that have bans on docking, Schipperkes display their natural tails, which vary in type.\nKnown for a stubborn, mischievous, and headstrong temperament, it also chases small animals.  The Schipperke is sometimes referred to as the \"little black fox\", the \"Tasmanian black devil\", or the \"little black devil\".  They are naturally curious and high-energy dogs and require ample exercise and supervision.  Schipperkes are very smart and independent; and sometimes debate listening to owners, instead choosing to do whatever benefits them the most, and are not necessarily the proper dog for a first-time dog owner.   Schipperkes require training and a secure, fenced-in space to run.  They are formidable barkers and can be aggressive with other dogs. Otherwise they are overall good dogs, and their personality is a matter of how they are raised, and who they are around.  They often have a high prey drive, focusing on rodents and small animals, and can excel at obedience and agility competitions.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThe Schipperke has no particular health problems. The UK Kennel Club survey puts the median lifespan of the breed at 13 years old, with about 20% living to 15 years or more. Of the 36 deceased dogs in the survey, the oldest dog was \u200b17 1\u20442 years old.  Nonetheless, inactivity, lack of exercise and over-feeding are very harmful, and can lead to joint and skeletal problems and tooth, heart, lung or digestive conditions. Schipperke's primary orthopedic problem tends to be luxating patella and Legg-Perthes syndrome.  Some Schipperkes have demonstrated tendencies to epilepsy, although there are no tests: these seem to be related to genetic transmission.The one caveat to the Schipperke's good health is MPS IIIB, a genetic mutation that occurs in at most 15% of the total breed population. It only occurs in Schipperkes. The University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine has developed a test for the disease and began accepting samples in April 2003.  Clinical signs appear between two and four years of age, and there are no known cures or treatments.  The disease affects balance, negotiation of obstacles (such as stairs), and is similar to such lysosomal storage diseases in humans as Tay Sachs disease and Gaucher disease.\nThe Schipperke is also prone to some other physical problems as reported by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals.\n\n\n== Grooming ==\n\nThe Schipperke does not need expensive or excessive grooming. This breed is a moderate shedder, however. A brush that can reach the undercoat is the best. Regular weekly brushing is usually enough to keep the coat in good condition. There is no need for cutting or trimming and the ruff (hair around the neck) fluffs up naturally.\nSchipperkes can \"blow\" their coats up to several times a year, and usually females more frequently than males.  When this happens, they lose their undercoat.  Owners typically find warm baths helpful during this time to remove the undercoat, rather than getting fur all over the home.  Blowing their undercoat can last several days or weeks, and can take up to 2\u20133 months for Schipperkes to grow back.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSchipperkes were first recognized as a formal breed in the 1880s, their standard being written in 1889. Much of what is known of their origins and early history comes from Chasse et P\u00eache (French for \"Hunting and Fishing\") magazine, articles of which were translated into English and published by the English magazine The Stockkeeper.\nThe breed name of \"Schipperke\", in English-speaking nations, was thought to mean \"little boatman\". However while they were occasionally seen on barges it was not their original or primary function, and in the areas of Leuven and Brussels \"schipper\" was the word for shepherd, making the name translate as \"little shepherd\".Before the name \"Schipperke\" was officially taken, the breed was also known colloquially as \"Spits\" or \"Spitzke\", a name commonly used to describe a small dog with pointed ears. They were also occasionally called \"Moorke\", meaning \"little black animal\". Schipperkes are widely referred to in the United States, albeit erroneously, as \"Belgian barge dogs\" or \"Belgian ship dogs.\"  Apparently, however, their history dates to a seventeenth century black shepherd dog commonly called the Leuvenaar, a 40-pound dog often found in the Louvain region of Belgium and employed to guard flocks and transport.  These dogs are apparently the foundation breed for both the modern, and smaller, Schipperke and the modern, and larger, Black Belgian Shepherd Dog, also known as the Groenendael.In World War II, the Belgian Resistance used the dogs to run messages between various resistance hideouts and cells, to which occupying Nazi Forces were none the wiser.\nA Schipperke is intermittently featured in the tiger-centric movie Two Brothers (2004), and also appears in Daphne Du Maurier's short story A Borderline Case.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBelgian Shepherd Groenendael, also known as the Black Belgian Shepherd.\nBelgian Shepherd Laekenois\nBelgian Shepherd Malinois\nBelgian Shepherd Tervuren\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSchipperke FCI Breed Standard - http://www.fci.be/en/nomenclature/SCHIPPERKE-83.html\nSchipperke at Curlie"}, {"id": 426, "name": "Schweizer Laufhund", "country": "Switzerland", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog426", "description": "The Schweizer Laufhund is a breed of hound dog, originally from Switzerland.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Swiss Hound has very ancient origins.  Its presence in times of the Roman Helvetia is displayed on a mosaic which was discovered in Avenches, Switzerland, by the representation of packhounds corresponding to the varieties of Swiss hounds.  In the 15th century, this breed was sought after by Italian dog lovers and in the 18th century, by the French for its exceptional aptitude for hunting hare.  Its native lines have certainly been influenced by scenthounds of French breeding brought back to Switzerland by mercenaries.  In 1882, a standard was established for each of the five varieties of the Swiss Hound.  In 1909, those standards were revised and the total disappearance of the hound of Thurgovie was noted.  On 22 January 1933, one single standard was established for the five varieties of the Swiss Hound. Adolf Hitler owned one of these dogs, giving it the name \"The Schweizer Luftwaffe\".

The skin is dark grey colored under the reddish coat and marbled under the white coat.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Niederlaufhunde have a great sense of smell; they are fast, agile and passionate hunters which keep good track of the scent they are supposed to follow. Their voice is pleasant. These dogs are friendly, courageous and never aggressive. Some specimens are calmer than others.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAround the 1900 the hunting activities were restricted to districts, and since the hounds used until then were too fast for these limited areas, it was decided to establish a new type of hound. Using selected specimens of the medium-sized Schweizer Laufhund, smaller, shorter-legged hunting dogs were created. The Schweizer Niederlaufhund Club was formed on July 1, 1905.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSchweizer Laufhund\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSearch The Open Directory Project (DMOZ) links for clubs and information about the Schweizerischer Niederlaufhund"}, {"id": 428, "name": "Scotch Collie", "country": "United Kingdom, Scotland", "type": "", "picture": "dog428", "description": "The Scotch Collie is a landrace breed of dog which originated from the highland regions of Scotland. The breed consisted of both the long-haired (now known as Rough) Collie and the short-haired (now known as Smooth) Collie. It is generally believed to have descended from a variety of ancient herding dogs, some dating back to the Roman occupation, which may have included Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs and Viking Herding Spitzes. Other ancestors include the Gordon and Irish Setters.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn Scotland, this dog was referred to as \"cooley\", \"coaly\" and \"colley\" dogs. The name \"Collie\" is thought to come from the Scots word for \"black\" or \"coal\" (coll) and may have referred to a type of sheep (Coaley) which they were once used to herd. However, \"Collie\" might also have come from the Gaelic c\u00e0ilean and c\u00f3ilean for \"dog\" or \"young pup\", or from the Celtic word for \"useful\" which is \"collie\". Due to its popularity, it was imported to other countries including the U.S., where it simply became known as the Scotch Collie.\nIn its native land, Scotch Collies were used for herding sheep and other farm animals, as well as guarding the homestead and hunting. In the 1800s and early 1900s, a large number of these dogs were imported to America to assist families in maintaining their farms. As their numbers and popularity grew, the Scotch Collie began to be widely owned as pets and eventually shown at conformation events in both England (Birmingham 1860) and America (New York, around 1878).  In 1885, the Scotch Collie Club was formed and the breed was accepted into the AKC (American Kennel Club).  A year later, the Collie Club of America was formed.The name Scotch Collie was initially used by the AKC for this new breed. However, the \"Scotch\" was eventually dropped as the AKC chose to use the terms \"Rough\" and \"Smooth\" to refer to these collies. It is generally believed that this occurred in an attempt to differentiate the show dogs from the common, or working, Scotch Collies.Following the continued popularity of this breed and their increased appearance in conformation shows, the Rough and Smooth Collies began to change in form, developing the flat skull and long narrow head familiar in today's collies, along with the more pronounced mane, or bib, of the Rough Collie.  The changes occurred due to outcrossing with other dog breeds, possibly the Borzoi but more probably the Greyhound. These physical changes further separated the original Scotch Collies from the collies which developed from it.\nThe Scotch Collie was at one time registerable by the United Kennel Club as well as the National Kennel Club (as the Old Time Farm Shepherd) but, at some point, lost recognition and began to be absorbed into other breeds, including the English Shepherd, which opened its registry to the breed. Scotch Collies were not only instrumental in the development of the Rough and Smooth Collies, but also of the Australian Shepherd, and they may have materially contributed to the development of other breeds including, but not limited to, English Shepherds, Border Collies, and Shetland Sheepdogs.Although no longer recognized as a distinct breed by American breed clubs, the Scotch Collies continued to be popular with families and farmers as useful companions and helpers on the small farms/homesteads into the 1950s and 1960s. However, as the American farm began to decline, the Scotch Collie as a breed began to lose not only numbers but even their name, as the breed became referred to as 'Farm Collies', 'Farm Shepherds' and 'Old-fashioned Collies'.In the 1990s, renewed interest in the breed occurred, and remnants of the last known Scotch Collies in the U.S. were located in Tennessee and North Carolina (by Richard McDuffie), as well as in Canada (by Erika DuBois). These dogs were referred to as Old-Time Farm Shepherds, as opposed to Scotch Collies, primarily to avoid confusion with the more popular and widely recognized collie breeds.In the 2000s, the Scotch Collie still remained small in numbers and a group was formed to further promote the breed (OTSCA), this time referring to it as 'Old Time Scotch Collie'. The group maintains an open registry for Scotch Collies as well as any farm collie-type dog. As of May 2017, the pedigree database contained only 174 registered Old Time Scotch Collies.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFarm Collie\nOld Time Farm Shepherd\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOld-Time Scotch Collie Association, modern and historic article regarding the breed\nAmerican Working Farm Collie Association\nScotch Collie Breed history and restoration efforts\nPedigree database instructions"}, {"id": 429, "name": "Scottish Deerhound", "country": "United Kingdom, Scotland", "type": "Sighthound and Pariah", "picture": "dog429", "description": "The Scottish Deerhound, or simply the Deerhound, is a large breed of hound (a sighthound), once bred to hunt the Red Deer by coursing.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Scottish Deerhound's antecedents existed back to a time before recorded history. They would have been kept by the Scots and Picts, and used to help in providing part of their diet, mainly hoofed game. Archaeological evidence likely supports this in the form of Roman pottery from around 1st Century AD found in Argyll which depicts the deerhunt using large rough hounds (these can be viewed at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh). Other similar evidence can be found on standing stones from around the 7th century AD reflecting a hunt using hounds, such as the Hilton of Cadboll Stone. \nIn outward appearance, the Scottish Deerhound is similar to the Greyhound, but larger and more heavily boned. However, Deerhounds have a number of characteristics that set them apart. While not as fast as a Greyhound on a smooth, firm surface, once the going gets rough or heavy they can outrun a Greyhound. The environment in which they worked, the cool, often wet, and hilly Scottish Highland glens, contributed to the larger, rough-coated appearance of the breed. The Deerhound is closely related to the Irish Wolfhound and was the main contributor to the recovery of that breed when it was re-created at the end of the 19th century.\nThe Deerhound was bred to hunt red deer by \u201ccoursing\u201d, and also \u201cdeer-stalking\u201d until the end of the 19th century. With modern rifles and smaller deer-forests, slower tracking dogs were preferred to fast and far-running Deerhounds.\nIn coursing deer, a single Deerhound or a pair was brought as close as possible to red deer, then released to run one of them down by speed, which if successful would happen within a few minutes - rarely were there sustained chases.\nWith the eventual demise of the clan systems in Scotland, these hunting dogs became sporting animals for landowners and the nobility, but were also bred and hunted by common folk when feasible. As fast and silent hunters they made quick work of any game the size of a hare or larger and were highly regarded by nobility and poachers alike. One of the most precarious times in the breed\u2019s history seems to have been towards the end of the nineteenth century, when many of the large Scottish estates were split into small estates for sporting purposes, and few then kept Deerhounds. The new fashion was for stalking and shooting, which required only a tracking dog to follow the wounded animal, using a collie or similar breed. Although a few estates still employed Deerhounds for their original work, the breed was left in the hands of a few enthusiasts who made them a show breed.\nIn Australia, deerhounds have been used to hunt the kangaroo and wild boar. In addition, according to Teddy Roosevelt in \"Hunting the Grisley and Other Sketches\", some Canadian and American wolf hunters used them.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Scottish Deerhound resembles a rough-coated Greyhound. It is however, larger in size and bone. Height of males from 30 to 32 inches (75\u201380 cm) or more, weight 85 to 110 pounds (40\u201350 kg); height of females from 28 inches (70 cm) upwards, weight from 75 to 95 pounds (35\u201343 kg). It is one of the tallest sighthounds, with a harsh 3-4 inch long coat and mane, somewhat softer beard and moustache, and softer hair on breast and belly. It has small, dark \"rose\" ears which are soft and folded back against the head unless held semi-erect in excitement. The harsh, wiry coat in modern dogs is only seen in self-coloured various shades of gray (blue-gray is preferred). Historically, Deerhounds also could be seen with true brindle, yellow, and red fawn coats, or combinations. 19th century Scottish paintings tend to indicate these colours were associated with a wire haired coat, but, with show breeders preferring a longer coat, these genes now appear to be lost. A white chest and toes are allowed, and a slight white tip to the tail; a white blaze on the head or a white collar are not accepted. The head is long, skull flat, with little stop and a tapering muzzle. The eyes are dark, dark brown or hazel in colour. The teeth should form a level, complete scissor bite. The long straight or curved tail, well covered with hair, should almost reach the ground.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe Scottish Deerhound is gentle and extremely friendly. The breed is famed for being \ndocile and eager to please, with a bearing of gentle dignity. It is however a true sighthound which has been selected for generations to pursue game; consequently, most Deerhounds will be eager to chase. \nThe Deerhound needs considerable exercise when young to develop properly and to maintain its health and condition. That does not mean it needs a large house to live in; however it should have regular access to free exercise in a fenced or otherwise \"safe\" area. Deerhounds should not be raised with access only to leash walking or a small yard, this would be detrimental to their health and development. City dwellers with conviction, however, can keep the dog both healthy and happy, as long as they are willing to take their Deerhounds to nearby parks for lengthy runs and rigorous fetching sessions within these wider running courses. \nYoung Deerhounds can sometimes, depending on the individual, be quite destructive especially when they are not given sufficient exercise; however, the average adult Deerhound may want to spend most of the day stretched out on the floor or a couch sleeping. They do require a stimulus, preferably another Deerhound, and a large area to exercise properly and frequently \n. They are gentle and docile indoors and are generally good around company and children (however, due to their size, they require supervision with young children).\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nLongevity: the US health survey states 8.4 for males and 8.9 for females, the UK survey puts the average at 8.3 and median at 8.6. The serious health issues in the breed include cardiomyopathy; osteosarcoma; bloat; stomach or splenic torsion, called Gastric dilatation volvulus; and cystinuria. See current health studies.\nDeerhounds like other sighthounds have unique anatomical and physiological features likely due to intentional selection for hunting by speed and sight. Laboratory studies have established reference intervals for haematology and serum biochemical profiles in Deerhounds some of which are shared by all sighthounds, some of which may be unique to this breed.\n\n\n== Miscellaneous ==\nScottish Deerhounds compete throughout USA in conformation and lure coursing[2], in states where it is legal, they are used in hare coursing and for coyote hunting. Deerhounds can compete in obedience though few excel in it. Fewer still excel in dog agility or flyball because these competitions favor smaller dogs with lower body weight and a much shorter stride.\n\n\n== Notable Deerhounds ==\nA Scottish Deerhound named Foxcliffe Hickory Wind won Best In Show at the 2011 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show February 14\u201315, 2011.\nMaida was a cross-bred Deerhound belonging to Sir Walter Scott.\nA Scottish Deerhound named Cleod played the role of Padfoot, Sirius Black's canine Animagus form, in two films, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2005) and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007).\nThe Scottish Deerhound was the favorite dog breed of Danish writer Karen Blixen aka Isak Dinesen (1885-1962) during her years in East Africa (1914-31). The most cherished of them all was Dusk with whom she can be seen in several photos.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of domesticated Scottish breeds\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAlmirall, Leon V.

Initially one of the highland breeds of terrier that were grouped under the name of Skye Terrier, it is one of five breeds of terrier that originated in Scotland, the other four being the modern Skye, Cairn, Dandie Dinmont, and West Highland White Terriers. They are an independent and rugged breed with a wiry outer coat and a soft dense undercoat. The First Earl of Dumbarton nicknamed the breed \"the diehard\". The modern breed is said to be able to trace its lineage back to a single female, named Splinter II.\nThey are a small breed of terrier with a distinctive shape and have had many roles in popular culture. They have been owned by a variety of celebrities, including the 32nd President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose Scottie Fala is included with FDR in a statue in Washington, D.C., as well as by the 43rd President, George W. Bush.  They are also well known for being a playing piece in the board game Monopoly. Described as territorial, feisty dogs, they can make a good watchdog and tend to be very loyal to their family. Healthwise, Scottish Terriers can be more prone to bleeding disorders, joint disorders, autoimmune diseases, allergies, and cancer than some other breeds of dog, and there is a condition named after the breed called Scotty cramp. They are also one of the more successful dog breeds at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show with a recent best in show in 2010.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Scottish Terrier is a small, compact, short-legged, sturdily-built terrier of good bone and substance. They have a hard, wiry, weather-resistant coat and a thick-set, cobby body which is hung between short, heavy legs. These characteristics, joined with his very special keen, piercing, \"varminty\" expression, and his erect ears and tail are salient features of the breed. The eyes should be small, bright and piercing, and almond-shaped not round. The color should be dark brown or nearly black, the darker the better. The ears should be small, prick, set well up on the skull and pointed, but never cut. They should be covered with short velvety hair.Height at withers for both genders should be roughly 25 cm (9.8 in), and the length of back from withers to tail is roughly 28 cm (11 in). Generally a well-balanced Scottie dog should weigh from 8.5 to 10 kg (19 to 22 lb) and a female from 8 to 9.5 kg (18 to 21 lb).   It is about 10 to 11 inches (25 to 28 cm) in height.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\nThe Scottish Terrier typically has a hard, wiry outer coat with a soft, dense undercoat. The coat should be trimmed and blended into the furnishings to give a distinct Scottish Terrier outline. The longer coat on the beard, legs and lower body may be slightly softer than the body coat but should not be or appear fluffy.The coat colours range from dark gray to jet black and brindle, a mix of black and brown. Scotties with wheaten (straw to nearly white) coats sometimes occur, and are similar in appearance to the Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier or West Highland White Terrier.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nScotties are territorial, alert, quick moving and feisty, perhaps even more so than other terrier breeds. The breed is known to be independent and self-assured, playful, intelligent, and has been nicknamed the 'Diehard' because of its rugged nature and endless determination. The \"Diehard\" nickname was originally given to it in the 19th century by George, the fourth Earl of Dumbarton. The Earl had a famous pack of Scottish Terriers, so brave that they were named \u201cDiehards\u201d. They were supposed to have inspired the name of his Regiment, The Royal Scots, \"Dumbarton\u2019s Diehards\".Scotties, while being described as very loving, have also been described as stubborn. They are sometimes described as an aloof breed, although it has been noted that they tend to be very loyal to their family and are known to attach themselves to one or two people.It has been suggested that the Scottish Terrier can make a good watchdog due to its tendency to bark only when necessary and because it is typically reserved with strangers, although this is not always the case. They have been described as a fearless breed that may be aggressive around other dogs unless introduced at an early age. Scottish Terriers were originally bred to hunt and fight badgers. Therefore, the Scottie is prone to dig as well as chase small vermin, such as squirrels, rats, and mice.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nTwo genetic health concerns seen in the breed are von Willebrand disease (vWD) and craniomandibular osteopathy (CMO); Scottie cramp, patellar luxation and cerebellar abiotrophy are also sometimes seen in this breed. Common eye conditions seen in a variety of breeds such as cataracts and glaucoma can appear in Scotties as they age. There are no specific conditions relating the skin that affect the breed, but they can be affected by common dog related conditions such as parasites and mange. Scotties typically live from 11 to 13 years.\n\n\n=== Cancer in Scottish Terriers ===\nScottish Terriers have a greater chance of developing some cancers than other purebreds. According to research by the Veterinary Medical Data Program (1986), six cancers that Scotties appeared to be more at risk for (when compared to other breeds) are: (in descending order) bladder cancer and other transitional cell carcinomas of the lower urinary tract; malignant melanoma; gastric carcinoma; squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; lymphosarcoma and nasal carcinoma. Other cancers that are known to commonly affect Scotties include mast cell sarcoma and hemangiosarcoma.Research has suggested that Scottish Terriers are 20 times more likely to get bladder cancer than other breeds and the most common kind of bladder cancer is transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (TCC). Dr. Deborah Knapp of Purdue University School of Veterinary Medicine has commented \"TCC usually occurs in older dogs (average age 11 years) and is more common in females (2:1 ratio of females to males).\" Symptoms of TCC are blood in the urine, straining to urinate, and frequent urination\u2014although owners noticing any of these symptoms should also be aware that the same symptoms may also be indicative of a urinary tract infection.The most common and effective form of treatment for TCC is Piroxicam, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that \"allows the cancer cells to kill themselves.\" In order to help prevent cancer in a dog, an owner should ensure that their dog has minimal exposure to herbicides, pesticides, solvents and cigarette smoke; use caution when treating dogs with some flea medications; provide a healthy, vitamin-rich diet (low in carbohydrates, high in vegetables) and plenty of exercise.\n\n\n=== Scottie cramp ===\nScottie cramp is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder which inhibits the dog's ability to walk. It is caused by a defect in the pathways in the brain that control muscle contraction due to a low level of serotonin in the body. Typically symptoms only show when the particular dog is under some degree of stress. The front legs are pushed out to the side, the back arches and the rear legs overflex, causing the dog to fall should it be moving at speed. The condition is not seizure related, and the dog remains conscious throughout the event, with symptoms abating once the cause of the stress has been removed.Vitamin E, Diazepam and Prozac have all been shown to be effective treatments should it be required. Scotty cramp is found in other breeds of terrier, including the Cesky Terrier. \"Episodic Falling\", a condition found in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels is considered to be similar to this disorder.\n\n\n=== Craniomandibular osteopathy ===\nAlso known as \"Lion Jaw\", \"Westy Jaw\" or \"Scotty Jaw\", this condition of craniomandibular osteopathy is caused by excessive bone growth in the bottom jaw, usually occurring between four and seven months of age. Like Scottie Cramp, it is an autosomal recessive hereditary disorder, and can cause discomfort to the dog when it attempts to chew. The progression of the condition usually slows down between eleven and thirteen months of age, and is sometimes followed by a slow partial or complete regression.This condition has also been seen in other breeds of dog, such as the West Highland White Terrier, Cairn Terrier, Boston Terrier, as well as some larger breeds such as Bullmastiffs.\n\n\n=== von Willebrand's disease ===\nVon Willebrand's disease is a hereditary bleeding disorder found in both dogs and humans. It is caused by a lack of von Willebrand factor which plays a role in the clotting process of blood. This can cause abnormal platelet function and prolonged bleeding times. Affected dogs can be prone to nose bleeds, and increased bleeding following trauma or surgery. There are three types of this condition with Type I being the most common, while Type II and III being rarer, but more severe. Type I von Willebrand's disease is relatively common in the Scottish Terrier.Type I is more widespread in Doberman Pinscher, but is as common in the Shetland Sheepdog as the Scottish Terrier. The condition appears in most breeds to some extent, but other breeds with an increased risk include the Golden Retriever, German Shepherd Dog, Basset Hound and Manchester Terrier.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nInitial grouping of several of the highland terriers (including the Scottie) under the generic name Skye Terriers caused some confusion in the breed\u2019s lineage. There is disagreement over whether the Skye Terriers mentioned in early 16th century records actually descended from forerunners of the Scottie or vice versa. It is certain, however, that Scotties and West Highland White Terriers are closely related\u2014both their forefathers originated from the Blackmount region of Perthshire and the Moor of Rannoch. Scotties were originally bred to hunt and kill vermin on farms and to hunt badgers and foxes in the Highlands of Scotland.The actual origin of a breed as old as the Scottish Terrier is obscure and undocumented. The first written records about a dog of similar description to the Scottish Terrier dates from 1436, when Don Leslie described them in his book The History of Scotland 1436\u20131561. Two hundred years later, Sir Joshua Reynolds painted a portrait of a young girl caressing a dog similar in appearance to the modern-day Scottie. King James VI of Scotland was an important historical figure featuring in the Scottish Terrier's history. In the 17th century, when King James VI became James I of England, he sent six terriers\u2014thought to be forerunners of the Scottish terrier\u2014to a French monarch as a gift. His love and adoration for the breed increased their popularity throughout the world.Many dog writers after the early 19th century seem to agree that there were two varieties of terrier existing in Britain at the time\u2014a rough-haired so-called Scotch Terrier and a smooth-haired English Terrier. Thomas Brown, in his Biological Sketches and Authentic Anecdotes of Dogs (1829), states that \"the Scotch Terrier is certainly the purest in point of breed and the (smooth) English seems to have been produced by a cross from him\".  Brown went on to describe the Scotch Terrier as \"low in stature, with a strong muscular body, short stout legs, a head large in proportion to the body\" and was \"generally of a sandy colour or black\" with a \"long, matted and hard\" coat.  Although the Scotch Terrier described here is more generic than specific to a breed, it asserts the existence of a small, hard, rough-coated terrier developed for hunting small game in the Scottish Highlands in the early 19th century; a description that shares characteristics with what was once known as the Aberdeen Terrier and is today known as the Scottish Terrier. In addition, the paintings of Sir Edwin Landseer and an 1835 lithograph entitled \"Scottish Terriers at Work on a Cairn in the West Highlands\" both depict Scottie type terriers very similar to those described in the first Scottish Terrier Standard.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Highlands of Scotland, including the Isle of Skye, were abundant with terriers originally known by the generic term \"short-haired terriers\" or \"little Skye Terriers.\" Towards the end of the 19th century, it was decided to separate these Scottish   terriers and develop pure bloodlines and specific breeds. Originally, the breeds were separated into two categories: Dandie Dinmont Terriers and Skye Terriers (not the Skye Terrier known today, but a generic name for a large group of terriers with differing traits all said to originate from the Isle of Skye). The Birmingham England dog show of 1860 was the first to offer classes for these groups of terriers. They continued to be exhibited in generic groups for several years and these groups included the ancestors of today's Scottish Terrier. Recorded history and the initial development of the breed started in the late 1870s with the development of dog shows. The exhibition and judging  of dogs required comparison to a breed standard and thus the appearance and temperament of the Scottie was written down for the first time. Eventually, the Skye Terriers were further divided into what are known today as the Scottish Terrier, Skye Terrier, West Highland White Terrier and Cairn Terrier.While fanciers sought to identify and standardize the breed and its description through the late 19th century, the Scottish Terrier was known by many different names: the Highland, the Cairn, Diehard, and most often, the Aberdeen Terrier\u2014named because of the abundant number of the dogs in the area and because a J. A. Adamson of Aberdeen successfully exhibited his dogs during the 1870s. Roger Rough, a dog owned by Adamson, Tartan, a dog owned by Mr Paynton Piggott, Bon Accord, owned by Messrs Ludlow and Bromfield, and Splinter II owned by Mr Ludlow, were early winners of dog exhibitions and are the four dogs from which all Scottish Terrier pedigrees ultimately began. It is often said that all present day Scotties stem from a single bitch, Splinter II, and two sires. In her book, The New Scottish Terrier, Cindy Cooke refers to Splinter II as the \"foundation matron of the modern Scottish Terrier.\" Cooke goes on to say \"For whatever reason, early breeders line bred on this bitch to the virtual exclusion of all others. Mated to Tartan, she produced Worry, the dam of four champions. Rambler, her son by Bonaccord, sired the two founding sires of the breed, Ch. Dundee (out of Worry) and Ch. Alistair (out of a Dundee daughter)\"  Show champions on both sides of the Atlantic descend from  Splinter and her sires.Captain Gordon Murray and S.E. Shirley were responsible for setting the type in 1879. Shortly afterwards, in 1879, Scotties were for the first time exhibited at Alexander Palace in England, while the following year they began to be classified in much the same way as is done today. The first written standard of the breed was drafted by J.B. Morrison and D.J. Thomson Gray and appeared in Vero Shaw's Illustrated Book of The Dog, published in 1880; it was extremely influential in setting both breed type and name. The standard described the breed's colouring as \"Grey, Grizzle or Brindle\", as the typically Black colouring of Scotties did not become fashionable or favoured until the 20th century.\n\nIn 1881 the \"Scottish Terrier Club of England\" was founded, being the first club dedicated to the breed. The club secretary, H.J. Ludlow, is responsible for greatly popularising the breed in the southern parts of Great Britain. The \"Scottish Terrier Club of Scotland\" was not founded until 1888, seven years after the English club. Following the formation of the English and Scottish clubs there followed several years of disagreement regarding the breed's official standard. The issue was finally settled by a revised standard in 1930, which was based on four prepotent dogs. The dogs were Robert and James Chapman's Heather Necessity, Albourne Barty, bred by AG Cowley, Albourne Annie Laurie, bred by Miss Wijk and Miss Wijk's Marksman of Docken (the litter brother of Annie Laurie). These four dogs and their offspring modified the look of the Scottie, particularly the length of the head, closeness to the ground and the squareness of body. Their subsequent success in the show ring led to them becoming highly sought after by the British public and breeders. As such, the modified standard completely revolutionized the breed. This new standard was subsequently recognised by the Kennel Club UK circa 1930.Scotties were introduced to America in the early 1890s, but it was not until the years between World War I and World War II that the breed became popular. The Scottish Terrier Club of America (STCA) was formed in 1900 and a standard written in 1925.  The Scottish Terrier was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 1934. By 1936, Scotties were the third most popular breed in the United States. Although they did not permanently stay in fashion, they continue to enjoy a steady popularity with a large segment of the dog-owning public across the world.  The STCA founded its Health Trust Fund (HTF) in 1995 which supports research on health issues in the breed.\nScottish Terriers have won best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show more than any other breed except for the Wire Fox Terrier, a total of nine times. These victories began in 1911 with a win by Ch. Tickle Em Jock and include recent victories such as in 1995 when Ch. Gaelforce Post Script (Peggy Sue) won, and in 2010 with a victory by Ch. Roundtown Mercedes Of Maryscot.\n\n\n== Famous Scotties and popular culture ==\n\nThe Scottie and the German Shepherd are the only breeds of dog that have lived in the White House more than three times. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was renowned for owning a Scottie named Fala, a gift from his distant cousin, Margaret Suckley. The President loved Fala so much that he rarely went anywhere without him. Roosevelt had several Scotties before Fala, including one named Duffy and another named Mr. Duffy. Eleanor Roosevelt had a Scottish Terrier named Meggie when the family entered the White House in 1933. More recently, President George W. Bush has owned two black Scottish Terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley. Barney starred in nine films produced by the White House.\n\nOther famous people who are known to have owned Scotties include: Queen Victoria, Eva Braun, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Ed Whitfield, Rudyard Kipling and President of Poland, Lech Kaczy\u0144ski. Actress Tatum O'Neal owned a Scottish Terrier. She was said to be so saddened by her dog's death to cancer and old age that she relapsed into drugs.The Scottie is also renowned for being featured in the popular board game, Monopoly, as a player token. When the game was first created in the 1930s, Scotties were one of the most popular pets in the United States, and it is also one of the most popular Monopoly game tokens, according to Matt Collins, vice president of marketing for Hasbro. In Disney's 1955 film Lady and the Tramp, a Scottish terrier named Jock is the friend of Lady, the American Cocker Spaniel. A Scottish Terrier named Dulcinea is a scene-stealer in the 1998 Latin American novel Yo-Yo Boing! by Giannina Braschi.In May 2007, Carnegie Mellon University named the Scottish Terrier its official mascot. The Scottie had been a long-running unofficial mascot of the university, whose founder's Scottish heritage is also honored by the official athletic nickname of \"Tartans\". Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia also uses the Scottie as their mascot. The dog's image is a symbol for the Radley brand of bags. The amateur athletics organisation Jogscotland has an anthropomorphic Scottish Terrier as its mascot.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of domesticated Scottish breeds\nScotty dog sign (radiological term)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nScottish Terrier at Curlie"}, {"id": 431, "name": "Sealyham Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom, Wales", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog431", "description": "The Sealyham Terrier (Welsh: Daeargi Sealyham) is a rare Welsh breed of small to medium-sized terrier that originated in Wales as a working dog.  It is principally a white-bodied, rough coated breed, developed in the mid to late 19th century by Captain John Edwardes at Sealyham House, Pembrokeshire.\nFollowing the First World War, it surged in popularity and was associated with Hollywood stars and members of the British Royal Family. Its numbers have dropped significantly since then, with the breed listed as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club; an all-time low was recorded in 2008 when only 43 puppies were registered in the United Kingdom. This decline has been blamed on an influx of foreign and designer breeds, and the Sealyham's reduced usefulness as a working dog.\nThis breed is equally suitable as a family dog or a working terrier, given the right training. It is affected by few breed specific breed disorders, with the only two prevalent conditions being lens luxation and canine degenerative myelopathy.  A DNA test is now readily available to identify dogs who carry the gene that causes lens luxation and breeding programs can be adjusted.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe breed was developed between 1850 and 1891 by Captain John Edwardes, at Sealyham House, near Wolfscastle in the Welsh county of Pembrokeshire. Originally the breed was used for pest control, to hunt small game, and to eliminate vermin,  particularly badgers, which he usually relocated. The Welsh Corgi, Fox Terrier (Wire), and the now extinct English White Terrier all played a part in the make up of the Sealyham, although Edwardes did not keep records. He wanted a small white dog with a strong jaw, and a wiry coat. The white coat was particularly prized, as it meant that the hunter in the field could distinguish the dogs from the quarry. Edwardes culled weak dogs, and bred the stronger ones. After Edwardes' death in 1891, other breeders began to work with Sealyhams, including Fred Lewis, who promoted the breed.\n\nThe breed was shown for the first time in 1903, and the Sealyham Terrier club was created in 1908; the breed was officially recognised by the Kennel Club in 1911. The Sealyham Terrier now is recognised by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world. During the early stages of its recognition, the breed was alternatively known as the Welsh Border Terrier, or the Cowley Terrier. The American Sealyham Terrier Club was founded in 1913.During the 1920s and 1930s, Sir Jocelyn Lucas used the dogs to hunt badgers which he usually relocated. At this time he also used Sealyham Terriers for hunting otters, stoats and squirrels. Deciding that he wanted a better hunting dog than the Sealyhams, bred for conformation showing, he cross-bred the dogs with the Norfolk Terrier. This resulted in an unrecognised breed of dog he called the Lucas Terrier, which he described as \"death to rats and rabbits\".The Sealyham surged in popularity after the First World War in the UK and the United States. Within the Hollywood film industry, the Sealyham became a fashionable dog to own by the Hollywood elite. The terrier was owned by actors Humphrey Bogart, Bette Davis, Elizabeth Taylor, and by writer Agatha Christie. Cary Grant owned one which he named Archie Leach \u2013 Grant's real name. Alfred Hitchcock had one of his Sealyham Terriers seen in his 1941 film Suspicion. Alfred Hitchcock can also be seen at the start of his 1963 film, The Birds, walking two of his Sealyham Terriers in a cameo appearance, although he also owned a third Sealyham not featured in the movie. The British Royal Family also favoured these dogs; King George V owned a dog named Jack. In 1959 one Sunday newspaper reported in the UK: \"A notice has been posted in Clarence House and Windsor Castle giving explicit instructions that when Princess Margaret has breakfast in bed, her two Sealyhams must be brought to the room along with her breakfast tray.\" These two dogs were called Pippin and Johnny, and were looked after by the Queen Mother when Princess Margaret fell ill. In the 1960s, children's author Maurice Sendak owned a Sealyham named Jennie, which he featured in his 1967 work Higglety Pigglety Pop!.\n\nThe Sealyham was once one of the more popular terriers, with over 2,000 puppies registered in the UK during the 1920s, and one of the best known Welsh breeds. Today, however, the Kennel Club (UK) lists the Sealyham as amongst the most endangered native breeds. In 2008, registrations of new puppies with the Kennel Club dropped to an all-time low of 43, placing it among the bottom three on the list of Vulnerable Native Breeds. In October 2011, British magazine Country Life highlighted the breed on its front cover, with the heading \"SOS: Save our Sealyhams\", and launched a campaign to save the breed. End of year figures for 2011 showed that 49 puppies were registered with the Kennel Club in the UK, keeping them within the bottom three on the list of most endangered breeds.Another notable Sealyham Terrier, Ch. Efbe's Hidalgo At Goodspice, also known as Charmin, won Best In Show at Crufts in 2009, but his victory was not televised as the BBC had dropped the coverage of the competition earlier that year, following the controversy after the channel showed the documentary Pedigree Dogs Exposed. He had previous won the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in the United States in 2007, and the World Dog Show in 2008. While in retirement, Charmin attended many shows as a spectator until he passed away in October, 2018.Harry Parsons, founder of the Working Sealyham Terrier Club, has stated that, \"To sustain a breed...you need between 300 to 500 puppies a year\". The Kennel Club has blamed the decline of the breed on the availability of designer dogs and newer breeds such as the Shih Tzu, and the banning of tail docking which has reduced their ability as working dogs. Paul Keevil, formerly of the Kennel Club's vulnerable breeds committee explains: \"Traditionally, soon after Sealyhams were born, their tails were docked by half their length, because they were small working dogs and they quite often got stuck down holes, meaning that they required short, strong tails for the owner to be able to pull them out.\" As of 2010, the breed is ranked 152nd out of 168 breeds according to registrations by the American Kennel Club.  By 2017, the breed ranked 150 out of 190 breeds registered by the American Kennel Club. \n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nSealyhams measurements vary by breed standard according to particular countries. The Kennel Club breed standard states that the height of a Sealyham Terrier should not exceed 12 inches (30 cm), measured at the withers or at the top of the shoulder blade. The ideal weight for a Sealyham is 8 kilograms (18 lb) for females, or 9 kilograms (20 lb) for males.They have a white double coat which requires regular brushing with a wire comb in order to prevent matting. It has a dense undercoat, while the outer coat is wiry and weather resistant. Markings on the face can be in a variety of colours including lemon, black, brown, blue, and badger, which is a mix of brown and black. Heavy body markings or patches or excessive ticking on the coat are discouraged. Sealyhams are low to the ground, and in muddy weather their long coats can become quite dirty. Sealyham coats are groomed by hand stripping, in order to keep the coat from becoming too soft. However, if they are not shown, Sealyhams can be clipped and this is often the preferred grooming approach for pets. As with many terriers, Sealyhams have essentially non-shedding coats.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nAlthough happy in the company of others, they are fine if left alone. Sealyham Terriers are suited for both the town and country. They can be strong willed, occasionally vocal, and boisterous but also full of personality and affectionate. While they make for loyal family companions, they can be trained to be working dogs, making them excellent mousers or ratters. They can also be taught as puppies to get along with other animals, including cats and birds.Harry Parsons, described his Sealyhams thus: \"They make great companions, and the way they bond with their owners is almost magical. I keep six indoors, and if someone rings about an infestation and asks us to go ratting, they will know and are out of the door in a millisecond. If you train them, they'll retrieve. They'll do anything to please you.\"\n\n\n== Health ==\nThis is a hardy breed with few breed specific health problems. The main hereditary problem highlighted by the American Sealyham Terrier Club is an eye condition called lens luxation, for which there are DNA tests. Genetic testing can now readily determine if the condition will be passed on and most breeders test both parents before breeding. Lens luxation is a condition in which the lens slips out of position in the eyeball due to the weakening of the fibers that holds it in place.\nThis in turn blocks the flow of fluids in the eye, leading to a painful increase in intra-ocular pressure (glaucoma) and often irreparable optic nerve damage, leading to visual field loss and eventual blindness.As of November 2011, the Kennel Club has not highlighted any specific concerns regarding the breed's health to conformation show judges. Due to the low numbers of the breed, two of the most prevalent problems facing the breed today is the popular sire effect and the general problem of genetic diversity within the breed.\n\n\n== References ==\nGeneral\nSpecific\n\n\n== External links ==\nSealyham Terrier at Curlie"}, {"id": 432, "name": "Segugio Italiano", "country": "Italy", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog432", "description": "The Segugio Italiano [se\u02c8\u0261ud\u0292o ita\u02c8ljano] is an Italian breed of dog of the scenthound family. It comes in both shorthaired and wirehaired varieties. It is thought to be an ancient breed, descended in pre-Roman eras from progenitor scenthounds in ancient Egypt. In 2009 ENCI (the Italian Kennel Club) registered 4,500 specimens of the shorthaired variety and 1,740 wirehaired specimens, making this one of the top ten breeds in Italy. \n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Segugio is a square shaped dog, whose length should be equal to its height at the withers. It is fawn-coloured or black and tan. The dogs are 45\u201352 cm tall at the withers and roughly 20\u201323 kg in weight. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Utilization ==\nThe breed's determination to track a scent is similar to that of a Bloodhound but, unlike the Bloodhound, the Segugio is also interested in the capture and killing of its prey. Its popularity in Italy is due to its outstanding performance as a hunter of game. Although Italians also use other hound breeds, such as Ariegeois, Petit Gascon-Saintongeois, Porcelaine, Posavac Hound, Istrian Coarse-haired Hound and Istrian Shorthaired Hound, the Segugio Italiano has remained the choice of most Italian hunters due to its exceptional abilities. Hunters who hunt hare alone or in small groups find this dog to be ideal. The Segugio Italiano can also hunt larger game, such as wild boar (although it is not considered a specialist for this quarry), wild sheep, wild goats or ungulates of the deer family. The Segugio Italiano works either alone or in packs, depending on the quarry. This dog is first and foremost a working dog, although breed rescues do now exist to rescue and rehome abandoned hunting Segugi and to promote the breed as a pet.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShorthaired Wirehaired at the Italian Federation (ENCI).\nSegugio Italiano Video\nSegugio Italiano video 2\nSegugio Italiano video 3\nSegugio Italiano Hunts Wild Boar in Piedmont\nSOS Segugi breed rescue"}, {"id": 433, "name": "Seppala Siberian Sleddog", "country": "Canada", "type": "", "picture": "dog433", "description": "A rare working dog breed, the Seppala Siberian Sleddog is developed for the purpose of pulling a sled in cold country. It is a moderate-sized dog averaging 18 to 23 kg (40 to 50 pounds) weight and 56 to 58 cm (22 or 23 inches) height. Colours and markings are considered of little importance; eyes may be brown, blue or any combination of the two colours. Seppalas are active and energetic but very docile and trainable.\nSepp\u00e4l\u00e4s show a primitive canine type, never having been bred or selected for conformation or the show ring. The breed shares its ancestral base with the Siberian Husky and for half a century shared the same registry with that breed, but was bred always exclusively as a working sleddog breed in its own right and kept apart from show bloodlines. In the late 1990s, it was recognised by Canadian agricultural authorities as a new \u201cevolving breed\u201d and in 2002 a similar separate breed initiative was started in the USA.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nSepp\u00e4l\u00e4s of today differ markedly from many other Siberian Husky bloodlines in physical appearance, being in general less flashily marked, longer in leg and body length, and lighter in weight and physical build than most Siberian Husky show dog lines. Pure-strain Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4s have dense, smooth coats of medium length with an undercoat nearly as long as the guard hairs. Their ears are taller, set close together and strongly erect, the \"stop\" of the head less well-defined than that of Siberian Huskies. The tail is held high in a sickle curve over the back when alert, never \"snapped\" flat to the back or curling down the flank.\nMany Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4s are pure white or buff and white. Others are very dark, black, or charcoal grey with dark faces and white only on the feet and tail tip. There are many varied shades of grey, brownish grey, and blue-grey. \u201cSable\u201d reds with black-tipped guard hairs and black noses occur, but the liver-nosed \u201ccopper\u201d phase seen in other lines of Siberian Huskies is unknown in pure Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4s. Agouti \"wild type\" coloration and piebald spotting are common.\nSepp\u00e4l\u00e4s are known for their extremely smooth and well-coordinated gait and for the consistency and strength with which they pull in harness. Although they appear to the inexperienced eye to be rather small and lightly built for sleddogs, actually they are far more efficient pullers than some larger northern breeds. They are capable racing sleddogs, particularly in mid-distance events, although perhaps not as speedy as world-class Alaskan huskies or pointer-crossed hybrids.Like other northern breeds, they shed their coats hugely once or twice a year, cannot safely be allowed to run free off leash, and love to hunt small game. They are generally robust and healthy, living twelve to sixteen years, usually working well in harness up to ten or eleven years of age. Health issues for the breed are those common to all northern breeds, such as allergies, cancer and eye problems. They are highly efficient in their use of food, eating relatively little but requiring very high-quality nutrition that is rich in animal protein, animal fat, and fish oil.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe defining characteristics of the breed are its natural, primitive appearance, its highly developed work ethic, and its affectionate, cooperative, and highly bonded nature. They tend to be more trainable than other sled dogs and to be more highly bonded to their owners. The Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 Siberian Sleddog disposition is active, merry, and often quite inquisitive, although sometimes showing great reserve with strangers. A stable and serious temperament, neither nervous nor aggressive, is characteristic. Natural, innate sleddog mentality is a primary characteristic of Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 dogs. Their nature is highly cooperative. They show great seriousness in their work in harness.\n\n\n== History ==\nBred by the legendary dog driver Leonhard Seppala from dogs imported into Alaska from eastern Siberia, the Seppala Siberians became famous in Alaska for their domination of the All-Alaska Sweepstakes distance race in the period from 1914 to 1917. Later they became popular in New England when Seppala raced there and ran a kennel in Poland Spring, Maine.In 1939 the last Siberia imports, along with several of Seppala\u2019s dogs, became the breed foundation for the \u201cSiberian Huskie\u201d in Canada. The Canadian Seppala Kennels of Harry R. Wheeler in St. Jovite Station, Quebec, developed and bred Seppala Siberians until 1950 in genetic isolation from the developing Siberian Husky breed in the USA, which gradually became oriented more and more toward conformation dog shows. A succession of Seppala breeders kept the strain alive through the 1950s and 1960s.In 1963, the third Seppala Kennels, run by C. S. MacLean and J. D. McFaul in Maniwaki, Quebec, closed without a successor kennel and by 1969 the unique Leonhard Seppala strain faced extinction. It was primarily saved by the timely action of two breeders: Markovo Kennels in Canada and Seppineau Kennels in the USA. The bloodline was then carried forward and developed as a serious mid-distance racing sleddog by Douglas W. Willett of Sepp-Alta Kennels in the state of Utah. The pure, original Seppala bloodlines are rare but found in small numbers in several Canadian provinces, the main population now occurring in Manitoba where the parent kennel relocated in 2008.The Seppala Siberian Sleddog Project that was started in 1993 by the protagonists of the Markovo rescue effort won Agriculture Canada\u2019s recognition for Seppalas in July 1997. The fourth historic Seppala Kennels in the Yukon Territory carried the breeding forward. In July 2002, Doug Willett undertook a similar breed initiative through the Continental Kennel Club\u2019s registry in the USA. At present two disparate populations use the same breed name: the original Agriculture Canada recognised population in Canada, identified by the Working Canine Association of Canada, and its descendants elsewhere, registered by the International Seppala Association; and the Continental Kennel Club population, which is not descended from the Canadian original. A third group of \"Seppalas\" is distinguished simply as an A.K.C.Siberian Husky bloodline.\n\n\n== References ==\nBragg, J. Jeffrey (1976).

Some 200 individuals in Finland represent the modern breed.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nAccording to traditional knowledge, the Seskar Seal Dog was a medium-sized, short-coated dog with a relatively light structure. Its head was wedge-shaped and muzzle relatively long and narrow. The ears were set forward and could be either erect or slightly folded. The tail was curled on the back. The short, shiny, and water-resistant coat was either black, brown, or white with black or brown markings.

The breed originates from Canton, China. The English name (\u6c99\u76ae, pinyin: sh\u0101 p\u00ed) is probably derived from the British spelling of the Cantonese equivalent, s\u0101 p\u00e8ih, which translates to \"sand skin\" and refers to the texture of its short, rough coat.  As puppies, Shar Pei have numerous wrinkles, but as they mature, these loosen and spread out as they \"grow into their skin.\" Shar Pei were named in 1978 as one of the world's rarest dog breeds by TIME magazine and the Guinness World Records. Although the Shar Pei has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century, the American Kennel Club recognized it as their 134th breed only in 1992.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nSmall, triangle ears, and a high-set tail also give the Shar Pei a unique look.  For show standard, \"the tail is thick and round at the base, tapering to a fine point\" (AKC standard February 28, 1998). As puppies, Shar pei are a lot more wrinkly than adults and, although some adults can be wrinklier than their puppy self, an adult pei should have wrinkles mostly on the face, a few on their shoulder and at the base of the tail.\n\n\n=== Colors ===\nThe Shar Pei's pigmentation resembles the Chow Chow as they have been crossed before, probably giving them the same blue-black tongue. There are over sixteen recognized colors in the AKC standard. The coat must be solid in\ncolor, and any Shar-Pei with a \"flowered coat\" (spotted) or black and tan in coloration (i.e. Rottweiler) is a disqualification. Colors include black, blue, cream, fawn, red-fawn, red, sable, apricot, chocolate, and isabella. The nose may be black or brick (pink with black), with or without a black mask. A Shar-Pei can also have what is called a \"dilute\" coloration, meaning the nose and nails of the dog are the same color as the coat, (i.e. chocolate coat with chocolate nose and nails). All of these color variations are acceptable, but the coat color must be solid and well blended throughout the whole body of the dog.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\n\nHorse-coat (unusual but regaining ground), rough to the touch, extremely prickly and off-standing, soft in one direction and harsh in the other; Brush-coat, with longer hair and a smoother feel; and Bear-coat (rare, and not recognized by the AKC; Bearcoats are due to the addition of other breeds). Examples of the breed were owned by the peasant class, and were used for working dogs and fighting due to their loose skin.\nWestern Shar Pei comes in three different coat types: horse, brush, and bear coat. The unusual horse coat is rough to the touch, extremely prickly and off-standing and is closer to the original traditional Shar Pei breed in appearance and coat type than the brush or bear coat. This coat is fairly prickly and can be rough or irritating when petting in the opposite direction of the fur. The horse coat is generally thought to be more active and predisposed to dominant behavior than the brush coat. The brush-coated variety have slightly longer hair and a smoother feel to them.  The brush coat is generally considered to be more of a \"couch potato\" than the horse coat. This breed sheds normally twice a year.Some people may experience a sensitivity to the harshness of the coat of either length. This is a mild, short-lived rash that can develop on the skin that has been in contact with the coat, most common on the forearms. \nAny coat longer than one inch at the withers is called a \"bear coat\" and is not considered breed standard, as it occurs only when both the male and female carry recessive coat genes. This coat length resembles the coat of the Chow Chow and was probably inherited from the chows. The personality of the bear coat is very much like that of a brush coat.\n\n\n=== Wrinkles ===\n\nThe traditional Shar Pei that is most popular in China is more faithful to the history of the breed (taller, less wrinkly, flatter mouth and nose, horse coated). As puppies, they have lots of wrinkles and as they get older, they get fewer wrinkles.\nScientists from the Department of Genome Sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle, announced in January 2010 that they had analysed the genetic code of 10 different pedigree dog breeds. In the Shar-pei, they discovered four small differences located in the gene HAS2 which is responsible for making hyaluronic acid synthase 2. That enzyme makes hyaluronic acid, which is one of the key components of the skin. There have been rare cases in which a mutation of the same gene has caused severe wrinkling in humans as well.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nAll Shar-Pei puppies need early socialization with children, strangers, and other animals. The Shar Pei is often suspicious of strangers, which pertains to their origin as a guard dog. It is a very independent and reserved breed. Nevertheless, the Shar Pei is extremely devoted, loyal and affectionate to its family and is amenable to accepting strangers given time and proper introduction at a young age. If poorly socialized or trained, it can become especially territorial and aggressive. Even friendly and well-socialized individuals will retain the breed's watch dog proclivities (like barking at strangers). It is a largely silent breed, barking only when it is playing or worried. The Shar-Pei were originally bred as palace guards in China. Although Shar-Pei are sometimes stubborn, they are receptive to fair, compassionate training. With repetition and a clear reward system, training is not very difficult, however they do not respond well to negative and cruel treatment. The Shar Pei can be a dog that is loyal and loving to its family while being very protective. Shar-Pei do not like to be alone, preferring to be close to their humans, often lying nearby in the same room.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nBecause of its popularity after being introduced to North America in the 1970s, the breed suffered much inexperienced or rushed breeding. This resulted in not only a dramatically different look for the Shar-Pei (as its most distinctive features, including its wrinkles and rounded snout, were greatly exaggerated), but also a large number of health problems. The American breed club states that few Shar Peis make it to age 10 and has a longevity program that records dogs that live 10 years or more.Compared to other breeds, Shar Peis have increased risk of developing atopic dermatitis, a chronic allergic skin disease. Dogs with allergic skin disease often get allergy-induced skin infections. Shar Peis are also at increased risk of demodicosis, a disease which happens when Demodex canis mites proliferate and cause skin irritation, inflammation and infection.Familial Shar Pei fever (FSF) is a serious congenital disease that causes short fevers lasting from 24 hours, sometimes up to three days and usually accompanied by accumulation of fluid around the ankles (called Swollen Hock Syndrome). Amyloidosis, a long-term condition, is most likely related to FSF, caused by unprocessed amyloid proteins depositing in the organs, most often in the kidneys or liver, leading eventually to renal failure. The disease is associated with the western type and it is estimated that 23% are affected. The Australian breed standard was changed in 2009 to discourage breeding for heavy wrinkling.A common problem is a painful eye condition, entropion, in which the eyelashes curl inward, irritating the eye. Untreated, it can cause blindness. This condition can be fixed by surgery (\"tacking\" the eyelids up so they will not roll onto the eyeball for puppies or surgically removing extra skin in adolescent and older Shar Pei). In Australia, more than 8 in 10 Shar Peis require surgery to correct eye problems, contributing to them being the most expensive breed to insure.The Shar-Pei is also prone to chronic yeast infections in its ears. This is due to tight inner ear structure with a wrinkled appearance, making cleaning very difficult; exacerbated by the tight \"flap\" that the ear creates over the canal, promoting a moist environment.Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common problem in the Shar Pei and is suspected to be hereditary.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Shar Pei has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th Century. The Shar Pei breed comes from the Guangdong province of China. The original Shar-Pei from China may have looked very different from the breed now popular in the West, (but that has not been confirmed) in southern China, Hong Kong, and Macau differentiate the Western type and the original type by calling them respectively 'meat-mouth' and 'bone-mouth' Shar-Pei.  The Guangdong province in China was also a popular trading place during the Han dynasty, and it is unclear if the Shar pei was brought to China, or if it originally was bred in China.\nThe Shar Pei's loose skin and extremely prickly coat were originally developed to help the dogs fend off wild boar, as they were used to hunt. Later, the breed was used for dog fighting; these enhanced traits made the Shar Pei difficult for its opponent to grab and hold on to, and so that if it did manage to hold on, the Shar Pei would still have room to maneuver and bite back; when grabbed by any loose wrinkle, a Shar Pei can actually twist in their skin and face in their opponent's direction. In fighting, they would twist in their skin to bite the assailant back.\n\nDuring the Communist Revolution, when the Shar Pei population dwindled dramatically, dogs were rescued by a Hong Kong businessman named Matgo Law, who in 1973 appealed to Americans through a dog magazine to save the breed. Around 200 Shar Peis were smuggled into America. The current American Shar Pei population stems mainly from these original 200.\n\n\n== Famous Shar Peis ==\nPussy is a British Shar Pei born in August 2012 who lives in California and has modeled for Piaget, De Beers and Chopard  appearing in publications including Harper's Bazaar.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of dog fighting breeds\nFoo Dog, dog breeds originating in China that resemble Chinese guardian lions and hence are also called Foo or Fu Dogs or Lion Dogs\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShar Pei at Curlie\nMore on the traditional Bone-mouth Shar-pei"}, {"id": 438, "name": "Shetland Sheepdog", "country": "United Kingdom, Scotland", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog438", "description": "The Shetland Sheepdog, also known as the Sheltie, is a breed of herding dog that originated in the Shetland Islands, Scotland. The original name of this breed was Shetland Collie, but when this caused controversy among the Rough Collie breeders of the time, the breed's name was formally changed to Shetland Sheepdog. This hard-working small dog is intelligent, vocal, excitable and willing to please. They are incredibly loyal to their owners and are often referred to as \"shadows\" due to their attachment to family. The breed was formally recognized by The Kennel Club in 1909.Like the Shetland pony and the Shetland sheep, the Shetland Sheepdog is a hardy but diminutive breed, developed to thrive amidst the harsh and meagre conditions of its native islands.  While the Sheltie still excels at herding, today it is also raised as a farm dog and family pet.The Shetland Sheepdog's origins are obscure but the Sheltie is not a direct descendant of the Collie. Rather, the Sheltie is a descendant of small specimens of the Scottish Collie and the King Charles Spaniel. They were originally a small mixed-breed dog, often only about 8 inches to 12 inches in height at the shoulder, and it is thought that the original Shetland herding dogs were of the Spitz type, and were crossed with Collies from mainland Britain. In the early 20th century,  James Loggie added a small Rough Collie to the breeding stock, and helped establish what would become the modern Shetland sheepdog.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nUnlike many miniature breeds that resemble their larger counterparts, this breed was not developed simply by selectively breeding the Rough Collie for smaller and smaller size. The original sheepdog of Shetland was a Spitz-type dog, probably similar to the modern Icelandic Sheepdog. This dog was crossed with mainland working collies brought to the islands, and then after being brought to England, it was further extensively crossed with the Rough Collie, and other breeds including some or all of the extinct Greenland Yakki, the King Charles Spaniel (not the Cavalier), the Pomeranian,  and possibly the Border Collie.  The original Spitz-type working sheepdog of Shetland is now extinct, having been replaced for herding there by the Border Collie.  The Shetland Sheepdog in its modern form has never been used as a working dog on Shetland, and ironically it is uncommon there.When the breed was originally introduced breeders called them Shetland Collies, which upset Rough Collie breeders, so the name was changed to Shetland Sheepdog. During the early 20th century (up until the 1940s), additional crosses were made to Rough Collies to help retain the desired Rough Collie type \u2013 in fact, the first AKC Sheltie champion's dam was a purebred rough Collie.The year 1909 marked the initial recognition of the Sheltie by the English Kennel Club, with the first registered Sheltie being a female called Badenock Rose.  The first Sheltie to be registered by the American Kennel Club was \"Lord Scott\" in 1911.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe general appearance of the Sheltie is that of a miniature Rough Collie. They are a small, double coated, working dog, agile and sturdy. Blue merle Shelties may have blue eyes or one brown and one blue eye, but all others have dark-coloured eyes. Their expression should be that of alertness with a gentle and sometimes reserved nature. They are often very good with children. They carry their tail down low, only lifted when alert and never carried over the back. They are an intensely loyal breed, sometimes reserved with strangers but should not be shy or showing timidness as per the AKC breed standard.\n\n\n=== Coat and colours ===\n\nShelties have a double coat, which means that they have two layers of fur that make up their coat. The long, rough guard hairs lie on top of a thick, soft undercoat.  The guard hairs are water-repellent, while the undercoat provides relief from both high and low temperatures.\nThe English Kennel Club describes three different colours: \"tricolour, blue merle, and sable (ranging from golden through mahogany), marked with varying amounts of white and/or tan.\" Essentially, however, a blue merle dog is a genetically black dog, either black, white, and tan (tricolour). In the show ring, blue merles may have blue eyes; all other colours must have brown eyes.\n\n\n==== Basic coat colours ====\n\nSable \u2013 Sable is dominant over other colours. May be pure for sable (two sable genes) or may be tri-factored or bi-factored (carrying one sable gene and one tricolour or bicolour gene). \"Tri-factored\" sable and \"shaded\" sable are not interchangeable terms. A shaded dog (one with a lot of black overlay on a sable coat) may or may not be tri-factored or bi-factored.\nTricolour \u2013 black, white, and tan. Tricolour is dominant over bi-black, and may carry the factor for bicolour.\nBi-black \u2013 black and white. Bi-black is recessive. A bi-black Sheltie carries two bi-black genes; thus any dog with a bi-black parent is always bi-factored whatever its own coat colour is.\n\n\n==== 'Modified' coat colours ====\n\nAny of the above colours may also have a colour modification gene. The colour modification genes are merling and white factoring. Merling dilutes the base colour (sable, tricolour, or bi-black) causing a black dog's coat to show a mix of black, white, and grey hairs, often with black patches.\n\nBlue merle\u2014blue, white and tan. A tricolour with the merling gene. May have blue eyes.\nBi-blue\u2014blue and white. A bi-black with the merling gene. May have blue eyes.\nSable merle\u2014faded or mottled sable and white. Often born with a mottled coat of darker brown over lighter brown, they usually present as a faded or lighter sable or can appear as a washed-out blue-merle. Sable merles are shown in the breed ring as sables; therefore, blue eyes are a major fault in AKC. Blue eyes are not faulted in sable merles in UKC.White factoring affects the amount of white on the dog. It is hard to tell, without actually breeding, whether a dog is white-factored or not, though dogs with white going up the stifle (the front of the hind leg) are usually assumed to be white-factored. Breeding two white-factored dogs can result in colour-headed whites \u2014 Shelties with coloured heads (sable, tricolour, bi-black, or blue or sable merle) and white bodies. For show dogs, dogs more than 50 percent white are heavily penalized and thus are not shown in the breed ring; they are normal in every other way.\nDouble merles, a product of breeding two merle Shelties together, have a very high incidence of deafness or blindness.There have been reports of a brindle Sheltie but many Sheltie enthusiasts agree that a cross sometime in the ancestry of that specific Sheltie could have produced a brindle. Unacceptable colours in the show ring are a rustiness in a blue or black coat. Colors may not be faded, no conspicuous white spots, and the colour cannot be over 50 percent white.\n\n\n=== Height and weight ===\nShelties normally weigh around 5\u201311 kilograms (11\u201324 lb). In general, males are taller and heavier than females. Accepted height ranges may differ depending on country and standard used. In the USA and Canada, breed standards state that males and females can be between 33\u201341 centimetres (13\u201316 in), all other standards (Australia, New Zealand and UK) specify males: 37 cm \u00b1 2\u00bd cm, females: 35.5 cm \u00b1 2\u00bd cm except FCI which specifies females: 36 cm \u00b1 2\u00bd cm at the shoulder (withers), however, some shelties can be found outside of these ranges but are not considered truly representative of the breed. Variation can be found within litters, and height (in the 40\u201350 cm range) is above the breed standard in some lines.\n\n\n=== Ears ===\nTo conform to the breed standards, the Shelties' ears should bend slightly or \"tip\", this contributes to the \"proper Sheltie expression\". The ear is to have the top third to a quarter of the ear tipped.  If a dog's ears are not bent (referred to as prick ears) some owners brace them into the correct position for several weeks to several months.  Wide-set (too much distance between) ears are also not a desired trait, nor are ears which tip too low down (referred to as 'hound' ears).\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\nShelties have a double coat, and often shed a lot of the time, no matter the season. The topcoat consists of long, straight, water-repellent hair, which provides protection from cold and the elements. The undercoat is short, furry and very dense and helps to keep the dog warm. Mats can be commonly found behind the ears, under the elbow on each front leg, and in the fluffy fur on the hind legs (the \"skirts\"), as well as around the collar (if worn). The coat is usually shed twice a year, often in spring and autumn. Females will also shed right before or right after giving birth. Male shelties technically shed less than females but fur still comes off constantly. Shaving these dogs is very bad for their skin and some do not regrow any significant amount of hair after being shaved, a condition known as alopecia.  Spaying or neutering can alter coat texture, making it softer, more prone to matting and even more profuse. Shelties shed in clumps which can be pulled or brushed out of the main coat, rather than individual hair. This makes them much easier to groom and clean up after than many smooth-haired dogs, which leave loose fur in their space.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nShelties have a high level of intelligence. According to Dr Stanley Coren, an expert on animal intelligence, the Shetland sheepdog is one of the brightest dogs, ranking 6th out of 132 breeds tested. His research found that an average Sheltie could understand a new command in fewer than five repetitions and would obey a command the first time it was given 95% of the time or better.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nFor the most part, Shelties are athletic and healthy. Like the Rough Collie, there is a tendency toward inherited malformation and disease of the eyes. Each individual puppy should have his/her eyes examined by a qualified veterinary ophthalmologist. Some lines may be susceptible to hypothyroidism, epilepsy, hip dysplasia, or skin allergies.\nShetland Sheepdogs have four times the risk of other dogs of developing transitional cell carcinoma, a cancer of the bladder.Dermatomyositis may occur at the age of 4 to 6 months, and is frequently misdiagnosed by general practice veterinarians as sarcoptic or demodectic mange. The disease manifests itself as alopecia on the top of the head, supra- and suborbital area and forearms as well as the tip of the tail.  If the disease progresses to its more damaging form, it could affect the autonomic nervous system and the dog may have to be euthanised.  This disease is genetically transmitted and recessive, with breeders having no clear methodology for screening except clear bloodline records.  Deep tissue biopsies are required to definitively diagnose dermatomyositis.  Lay assessment of end-stage dermatomyositis is observed difficulty or inability to swallow, even water. \nVon Willebrand disease is an inherited bleeding disorder. In Shelties, affected dogs as a general rule are not viable and do not live long.  The Sheltie carries type III of von Willebrands, which is the most severe of the three levels.  There are DNA tests that were developed to find von Willebrands in Shelties.  It can be done at any age, and it will give three results: affected, carrier or non-affected.  Shelties may also suffer from hypothyroidism, which is the under-functioning thyroid gland. It is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the thyroid gland. Clinical symptoms include hair loss or lack of coat, over- or under-weight, and listlessness.Although small breed dogs do not usually suffer unduly from hip dysplasia, it has been identified in Shelties. Hip dysplasia occurs when the head of the femur and the acetabulum do not fit together correctly, frequently causing pain or lameness.  Hip dysplasia is thought to be genetic. Many breeders will have their dogs' hips x-rayed and certified by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals.\n\n\n=== Eyes ===\nThe two basic forms of inherited eye diseases/defects in Shelties are Collie eye anomaly (CEA) and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA).\nCollie eye anomaly: An autosomal recessive inherited trait which results in incomplete closure of the embryonic fissure; seen almost exclusively in Collies, Border Collies and Shetland Sheepdogs. CEA can be detected in young puppies by a veterinary ophthalmologist.  The disease involves the retina. It is always bilateral although the severity may be disparate (unequal) between eyes. Other accompanying defects (ophthalmic anomalies) may wrongly indicate a more severe manifestation of CEA. CEA is present at birth and although it cannot be cured, it doesn't progress. Signs of CEA in shelties are small, or deepset eyes. That is, the severity of the disease at birth will not change throughout the dog's life. CEA is scored similar to the way hips are.\nCEA is genetic, inheritance is autosomal recessive, this means that even a dog that shows no phenotypic signs of the condition may be a carrier. Breeders should actively try to breed this disease out by only breeding with dogs that have \"clear\" eyes or very low scoring eyes.  A CEA score considered too high to breed with may still be low enough not to affect the dog's life. These dogs live happy and healthy lives as pets but should be not used for breeding. The recent development of a DNA test for CEA makes control of this disease much more likely as more breeders take advantage of the test.\nPRA can be detected at any time but usually does not show up until the dog is around two years old. Breeding dogs should be tested for genotype for this condition before breeding and only animals found \"clear\" should be used for breeding. PRA can occur in most breeds of dog including mix breeds. In most breeds it is also an autosomal recessive condition, however it has been found in other breeds to be autosomal dominant and sex-linked in others. As the name suggests, it is a progressive disease which will eventually result in total blindness.  Like CEA, an affected dog should not be bred with but these dogs can live happily as pets. Currently there is no treatment for either disease, but as both diseases (CEA and PRA) are hereditary it is possible to eliminate them using selective breeding.\n\n\n=== Breeding ===\nAs with all dogs, Shelties should be screened for inheritable genetic diseases before breeding. Both male and female should be tested for thyroid problems, Von Willebrands disease and brucellosis, as well as have hip x-rays and eyes cleared by the relevant national authorities.\nBreeding colours are also a problem for many beginner breeders.  Certain colour combinations can produce unwanted or potentially harmful results, such as mating blue merle to blue merle, which can produce what is called a \"double merle\", more likely to suffer from deafness or blindness. Mating a sable and white to a blue merle can produce a sable merle, which is undesirable for the show ring.  A tri-colour to a pure-for-sable (a sable and white which can produce only other sable and whites), will produce only sable and whites, but they will be tri-factored sable and whites (which means they have the tri-gene.)  There are many more examples of breeding for colour, so a good breeder will research colour genetics prior to breeding.  There are many different genes contributing to the different colours of the Sheltie, including the bi gene, the merling gene, the sable gene, and the tricolour gene.\n\n\n=== MDR1 gene mutation ===\nAccording to the College of Veterinary Medicine at Washington State University, the Shetland Sheepdog, and many other herding breeds, have a risk of being born with a MDR1 Gene Mutation, with about 15 percent of individuals affected. Cross-breeds are also affected. Dogs carrying Mdr1-1 share a common ancestor that experienced remarkable evolutionary success, having contributed genetically to at least nine distinct breeds of dog. Due to this genetic mutation, affected dogs may exhibit sensitivity or adverse reactions to many drugs, including Acepromazine, Butorphanol, Doxorubicin, Erythromycin, Ivermectin, Loperamide, Milbemycin, Moxidectin, Rifampin, Selamectin, Vinblastine, and Vincristine.\n\n\n== Working life ==\nAs the name suggests, Shelties can and have been used as sheepdogs and still participate in sheepdog trials to this day. Herding dogs conduct livestock from one place to another by causing fear-flocking and flight behaviour. The instinct to herd is primarily a product of breeding. No amount of training can substitute this trait.Shelties can also be great therapy dogs for those who need comfort during hard times such as natural disasters or severe illness.  This breed is rarely aggressive and tends to do well with children and being handled by them.\n\n\n=== Activities ===\nIn their size group, the breed dominates dog agility, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Shelties exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== Famous Shetland Sheepdogs ==\nCh Halstor's Peter Pumpkin ROM - The Shetland sheepdog sire with the most Champions (160).\nBadenock Rose - the first Shetland sheepdog registered with the English Kennel Club.\nMickey - main character of Canadian children's series Mickey's Farm\n\n\n== See also ==\nShetland animal breeds\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAmerican Shetland Sheepdog Association (ASSA)\nShetland Sheepdog at Curlie"}, {"id": 439, "name": "Shiba Inu", "country": "Japan", "type": "Northern Breed", "picture": "dog439", "description": "The Shiba Inu (\u67f4\u72ac, Japanese: [\u0255iba\u0320 in\u026f\u031f\u1d5d]) is the smallest of the six original and distinct spitz breeds of dog native to Japan.A small, agile dog that copes very well with mountainous terrain, the Shiba Inu was originally bred for hunting. It looks similar to and is often mistaken for other Japanese dog breeds like the Akita Inu or Hokkaido, but the Shiba Inu is a different breed with a distinct blood line, temperament and smaller size than other Japanese dog breeds.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nInu is the Japanese word for dog, but the origin of the prefix \"Shiba\" is less clear. The word shiba means \"brushwood\" in Japanese, and refers to a type of tree or shrub whose leaves turn red in the fall. This leads some to believe that the Shiba was named with this in mind, either because the dogs were used to hunt in wild shrubs, or because the most common color of the Shiba Inu is a red color similar to that of the shrubs. However, in an old Nagano dialect, the word shiba also had the meaning of \"small\", thus this might be a reference to the dog's diminutive stature. Therefore, the Shiba Inu is sometimes translated as \"Little Brushwood Dog\".\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Shiba's frame is compact with well-developed muscles. Males are 35 to 43 cm (14 to 17 in) at the withers. Females are 33 to 41 cm (13 to 16 in). The preferred size is the middle of the range for each sex. Average weight at preferred size is approximately 10.5 kg (23 lb) for males, 8 kg (18 lb) for females. Bones are moderate.\nThe Shiba is double coated, with the outer coat being stiff and straight and the undercoat soft and thick. Fur is short and even on the fox-like face, ears, and legs. Guard hairs stand off the body and are about 4 to 5 cm (1 1\u20442 to 2 in) long at the withers. The purpose of the guard hairs is to protect their underlying skin and to repel rain or snow. Tail hair is slightly longer and stands open in a brush. Their tails are a defining characteristic and makes them stand apart from other dog breeds. Their tails help to protect them from the harsh winter weather.  When they sleep, Shiba Inus curl up and use their tails to shield their face and nose in order to protect their sensitive areas from the cold. Shibas may be red, black and tan, or sesame (red with black-tipped hairs), with a cream, buff, or grey undercoat. They may also be white (cream), though this color is considered a \"major fault\" by the American Kennel Club and should never be intentionally bred in a show dog, as the required markings known as \"urajiro\" (\u88cf\u767d) are not visible; \"Urajiro\" literally translates to \"underside white\". Conversely, a white (cream) coat is perfectly acceptable according to the British Kennel Club breed standard.The urajiro (cream to white ventral color) is required in the following areas on all coat colors: on the sides of the muzzle, on the cheeks, inside the ears, on the underjaw and upper throat inside of legs, on the abdomen, around the vent and the ventral side of the tail. On reds: commonly on the throat, forechest, and chest. On blacks and sesames: commonly as a triangular mark on both sides of the forechest.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nShibas tend to exhibit an independent nature and sometimes show aggression. This is more prevalent among female Shibas and is influenced by the breed's strong prey drive. The Shiba Inu is best in a home without other small dogs or young children, but consistent obedience training and early socialization can make a difference. The breed also interacts fairly well with cats.From the Japanese breed standard:\n\nA spirited boldness, a good nature, and an unaffected forthrightness, which together yield dignity and natural beauty. The Shiba has an independent nature and can be reserved toward strangers but is loyal and affectionate to those who earn his respect. They can be aggressive toward other dogs.\nThe terms \"spirited boldness\" (\u608d\u5a01, kan'i), \"good nature\" (\u826f\u6027, ry\u014dsei), and \"artlessness\" (\u7d20\u6734, soboku) have subtle interpretations that have been the subject of much commentary.The Shiba is a relatively fastidious breed and feels the need to maintain itself in a clean state. They can often be seen licking their paws and legs, much as cats do. They generally go out of their way to keep their coats clean. Because of their fastidious and proud nature, Shiba puppies are easy to housebreak and in many cases will housebreak themselves. Having their owner simply place them outside after meal times and naps is generally enough to teach the Shiba the appropriate method of toileting.A distinguishing characteristic of the breed is the so-called \"shiba scream\". When sufficiently provoked or unhappy, the dog will produce a loud, high pitched scream. This can occur when attempting to handle the dog in a way that it deems unacceptable. The animal may also emit a very similar sound during periods of great joy, such as the return of the owner after an extended absence, or the arrival of a favored human guest.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Shiba Inu has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th Century.Originally, the Shiba Inu was bred to hunt and flush small game, such as birds and rabbit. Shiba lived in the mountainous areas of the Ch\u016bbu region. During the Meiji Restoration, western dog breeds were imported and crosses between these and native Japanese breeds became popular. From 1912 to 1926, almost no pure Shiba remained. From around 1928, hunters and intellectuals began to show interest in the protection of the remaining pure Shiba;  however, despite efforts to preserve the breed, the Shiba nearly became extinct during World War II due to a combination of food shortage and a post-war distemper epidemic. All subsequent dogs were bred from the only three surviving bloodlines. These bloodlines were the Shinshu Shiba from Nagano Prefecture, the Mino Shiba from the former Mino Province in the south of present-day Gifu Prefecture, and the San'in Shiba from Tottori and Shimane Prefectures. The Shinshu Shibas possessed a solid undercoat, with a dense layer of guard-hairs, and were small and red in color. \n\nThe Mino Shibas tended to have thick, prick ears, and possessed a sickle tail, rather than the common curled tail found on most modern Shibas. The San'in Shibas were larger than most modern shibas, and tended to be black, without the common tan and white accents found on modern black-and-tan shibas. When the study of Japanese dogs was formalized in the early and mid-20th century, these three strains were combined into one overall breed, the Shiba Inu. The first Japanese breed standard for the Shiba, the Nippo Standard, was published in 1934. In December 1936, the Shiba Inu was recognized as a Natural Monument of Japan through the Cultural Properties Act, largely due to the efforts of Nippo (Nihon Ken Hozonkai), the Association for the Preservation of the Japanese Dog.In 1954, an armed service family brought the first Shiba Inu to the United States. In 1979, the first recorded litter was born in the United States. The Shiba was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1992 and added to the AKC Non-Sporting Group in 1993. It is now primarily kept as a pet both in Japan and abroad. According to the American Kennel Club, the Shiba Inu is the number one companion dog in Japan. In the United States, the growing popularity of the Shiba Inu is evident as the American Kennel Club Registration Statistics ranked the breed in 44th place in 2016; a rise from 50th place in 2012.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nOverall, the Shiba Inu is  a healthy dog breed.\nHealth conditions known to affect this breed are allergies, glaucoma, cataracts, hip dysplasia, entropion, and luxating patella. \nPeriodic joint examinations are recommended throughout the dog's life.  Eye tests should be performed yearly as eye problems can develop over time. By two years of age, Shiba Inus may be considered fully free from joint problems, if none have been discovered, since at this age the skeleton is fully developed.\nAs with most dog breeds, Shibas should be walked or otherwise exercised daily.\n\n\n=== Life span ===\nTheir average life expectancy is from 12 to 15 years. Exercise, especially daily walks, is preferred for this breed to live a long and healthy life. The oldest known Shiba, Pusuke, died at age 26 in early December 2011. Pusuke was the oldest dog alive at the time and lived three years less than the world record for longest living dog.\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\nThese dogs are very clean, so grooming needs will likely be minimal. A Shiba Inu's coat is coarse; short to medium length with the outer coat being 2.5 to 3.2 cm (1 to 1 1\u20444 in) long, and is naturally waterproof so there is little need for regular bathing. They also have a thick undercoat that can protect them from temperatures well below freezing. However, shedding, also known as blowing coat, can be a nuisance. Shedding is heaviest during the seasonal change and particularly during the summer season, but daily brushing can temper this problem. It is recommended that owners never shave or cut the coat of a Shiba Inu, as the coat is needed to protect them from both cold and hot temperatures.\nShiba Inu\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDoge (meme)\nMameshiba\nDogecoin, which features a likeness of the breed.\nJapan Kennel Club\nShiba Inu Puppy Cam\nNihon Ken Hozonkai\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShiba Inu at Curlie"}, {"id": 440, "name": "Shih Tzu", "country": "China", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog440", "description": "A Shih Tzu (UK: , US: ; Chinese: \u897f\u65bd\u72ac; pinyin: x\u012bsh\u012b qu\u01cen), also known as the Chrysanthemum Dog, is a toy dog breed, weighing from 4 to 7.25 kilograms (9\u201316 lbs) when fully grown. The breed developed in China. The exact origin is unknown and is thought to have originated in the Tibetan Plateau.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Shih Tzu is a sturdy little dog with a short muzzle and large dark eyes. They have a soft and long double coat. Although sometimes long, a Shih Tzu will not always have extremely lengthy hair. Some of them have more short, curly hair. This is purely a choice made by the owners. A Shih Tzu should stand no more than 26.7 cm (10\u00bd in.) at the withers and with an ideal weight of 4.5 to 7.3 kg (10 to 16 lbs). Drop ears are covered with long fur, and the heavily furred tail is carried curled over the back. The coat may be of any color, though white and with blazes of grey are frequently seen. The Shih Tzu is slightly longer than tall, and bigger dogs ideally should carry themselves \"with distinctly arrogant carriage\". A very noticeable feature is the underbite, which is required in the breed standard.The traditional long silky coat, which reaches the floor, requires daily brushing to avoid tangles. Because of their long coat and fast-growing hair, regular grooming is necessary, which may be expensive and should be taken into account when considering adopting one of this breed. Often, the coat is clipped short to simplify care, but the coat still requires daily brushing. For conformation showing, the coat must be left in its natural state, though trimming for neatness around the feet and anus is allowed. The shorter cut is typically called a \"puppy cut\" or a \"teddy bear cut\" when the puppy cut is accompanied by a fuller, rounder face, resembling a stuffed animal.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nAlthough an individual Shih Tzu's temperament varies from dog to dog, the breed has a personality and temperament that is loyal, affectionate, outgoing, cute and alert. They tend to be possessive around other dogs. Training and proper socializing must start at a young age for the Shih Tzu to obey basic commands, for the Shih Tzu is prone to stubbornness when it comes to training. While the Shih Tzu is an excellent watchdog because of its alert and active nature, it was not specifically bred for this purpose. Unlike the Lhasa Apso, which was bred to be a sentinel dog that enjoys high perches and is wary of strangers, the Shih Tzu prefers to be close to its companions and will often offer strangers its affection. Because of its friendly nature, the Shih Tzu tends to interact well with other dogs and with children and adults. They may be a little temperamental with hyper or larger breeds, but generally the Shih Tzu gets along well with other pets. They are generally well behaved and suitable for families.\n\n\n== Coat colors and quality ==\n\nThe Shih Tzu comes in a range of colours that include various shades of gold, white, brown, and black. Other colours include black mask gold, black and white, solid black, solid liver, liver and white, brindle, white, red and white, and grey and white. Thus, when two Shih Tzu mate, there is a possibility that their offspring's coat will be similar to the sire's color, dam's color, tricolor, or a mix of both parents' color in one classification. An interesting point (and often a point of confusion) is that while the coat color of those with black pigmented skin (nose, lips, pads, also referred to as \"leather\") is determined by the color of the coat itself; the coat color on dogs with either liver or blue pigment is categorized by the color of the pigment. Thus, a parti colored (white and another shade) Shih Tzu with blue pigment is a \"blue and white\" regardless of the tint of the hair which might very well appear similar to a gold and white or other colors. The same principle applies to solid blue, silver, and silver and white. Sometimes you might see dark brown pigments near the shoulders and between the armpits.  The coat color changes as the dog gets older. \nThe typical fine, straight, and silky Shih Tzu coat has also been listed by many popular dog information websites as being hypoallergenic. In comparison with many other breeds, Shih Tzu do not shed to the same degree, only losing small amounts when bathed or brushed. It is the dog's dander and saliva that trigger most allergic reactions. Allergists do recognize that, at times, a particular allergy patient will be able to tolerate a particular dog; but they agree that \"the luck of the few with their pets cannot be stretched to fit all allergic people and entire breeds of dogs\". The Shih Tzu coat is said to fall out only when brushed or broken, or just said to shed. The coat may also be wavy or coarse.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name comes from the Chinese language word for \"lion\" because this kind of dog was bred to resemble \"the lion, as depicted in traditional oriental art\". (The Pekingese breed is also called \"lion dog\" in Chinese.) \"Shih Tzu\" is the Wade-Giles romanization of the Chinese characters \u7345\u5b50, meaning lion; this romanization scheme was in use when the breed was first introduced in America. In contemporary China, Pinyin is the predominant system of romanization, which renders it as sh\u012bzi. The Mandarin Chinese pronunciation is approximately SHIRR-dz\u0259. Though the Wade-Giles system is often regarded as less intuitive, \"Shih Tzu\" is a useful linguistic example of both of two cases where the Wade-Giles scheme reflects the use of a syllabic fricative after a corresponding consonant cluster (retroflexes and sibilants) in modern Mandarin. This is a unique phonological feature that does not appear in any other known modern language in their standardized form. Indeed, though the exact classification is still debated (and dialectal variants exist), linguists generally agree that these sounds cannot be represented by conventional symbols in the IPA; hence an unorthodox approximation \"SHIRR\" was used earlier in this paragraph. However, the use of a syllabic fricative is often observed in informal English with the paralinguistic expression \"Shh!\", which may serve as a guide to the pronunciation of \"Shih\". \nIn the modern Chinese language, the Shih Tzu is generally known as the \"Xi Shi dog\"; Xi Shi was regarded as one of the most beautiful women of ancient China. The alternative name was adopted to avoid the confusion that stems from referring to the breed as a lion. Shih Tzu were nicknamed the Chrysanthemum Dog in England in the 1930s. The dog may also be called the Tibetan Lion Dog; but whether the breed should be referred to as \"Tibetan\" or \"Chinese\" is a source of both historical and political contention, as the subsequent section notes. A book on the breed states that \"dog historians tend to have very strong opinions\" on the subject.\n\n\n== History ==\nDNA analysis placed the ancestors of today's Shih Tzu breed in the group of \"ancient\" breeds indicating \"close genetic relationship to wolves\". Another branch coming down from the \"Kitchen Midden Dog\" gave rise to the Papillon and Long-haired Chihuahua and yet another \"Kitchen Midden Dog\" branch to the Pug and Shih Tzu.\nIt is also said that the breed originated in China, hence the name \"Lion Dog\", in 800 B.C.There are various theories of the origins of today's breed. Theories relate that it stemmed from a cross between the Pekingese and Lhasa Apso, a Tibetan dog given by the Dalai Lama to Chinese emperors near the end of the 17th century. Dogs during ancient times were selectively bred and seen in Chinese paintings. The dogs were favorites of the Chinese royals and so prized that, for years, the Chinese refused to sell, trade, or give any away. The first dogs of the breed were imported into Europe (England and Norway) in 1930 and were classified by the Kennel Club as \"Apsos\". The first European standard for the breed was written in England in 1935 by the Shih Tzu Club, and the dogs were categorised again as Shih Tzu. The breed spread throughout Europe and was brought to the United States after World War II, when returning members of the U.S. military brought back dogs from Europe, in the mid-1950s. The Shih Tzu was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1969 in the Toy Group.The breed is now recognized by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world. It is also recognized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale for international competition in Companion and Toy Dog Group, Section 5, Tibetan breeds. In the United States, the Shih Tzu ranked the 15th most popular breed in 2013, falling slightly in popularity since 2012 when it was placed in 11th position.In 1934, the Shih Tzu Club of England was founded and the breed was officially recognised by the Kennel Club (UK) on 7 May 1940. When it became eligible for Challenge Certificates, none were awarded until 1949.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nA number of health issues, some of them hereditary, have been found in individual Shih Tzu, and are listed below.\n\n\n=== Hypothyroidism ===\nHypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland malfunctions and stops producing a hormone responsible for proper metabolism. This malfunction is commonly attributed to immune system problems. It usually affects middle-aged dogs and is seen in all breeds. Symptoms include hair loss, weight gain, muscle loss, and lethargy. This disease is usually diagnosed through blood tests. It can be effectively treated with drug therapy.\n\n\n=== Intervertebral disk disease ===\nIntervertebral disk disease in the dog is a common chondrodystrophic disorder manifested by acute back pain, loss of coordination, paresis, and loss of the ability to feel deep pain sensations. IVDD commonly occurs in certain toy breeds, such as Dachshund, Pekingese, French Bulldog, Beagle, Basset Hound, American Cocker spaniel, Shih Tzu, Lhasa Apso, and Welsh Corgi.\n\n\n=== Breathing problems ===\nShih Tzu have a number of respiratory problems related to the shape of their face and head. Brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome is a common problem and mostly affects dogs with short noses (brachycephalic breeds). An obstruction in the upper airways causes the dog to have labored breathing. Not every brachycephalic dog will develop respiratory problems, but most will to some degree. Severe problems may require surgery.\n\n\n=== Eye issues ===\nIt is very common for Shih Tzus to develop eye problems at any age, and even more so once they are older. Most veterinarians will recommend eye drops to assist with any eye irritations. Some dogs have allergies which causes excess discharge around the eye. Older Shih Tzu are known to develop cataracts which can be corrected with surgery. If not treated, the dog may become blind in the eye that has the cataract. The distinctive large eyes can easily be scratched which may cause an ulcer. The dog will normally have the injured eye closed or half closed and may have excessive tears.\n\n\n=== Other health issues ===\nSome health issues in the breed are portosystemic shunt of the liver and hip dysplasia in standard sizes. There have been cases of Shih Tzu being epileptic, which in turn may lead to shortening of the lifespan of the Shih Tzu if untreated. Many Shih Tzu dogs are also prone to ear infections.The Shih Tzu may be more prone than other breeds to get a blood disease called immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, which causes their immune system to attack itself and kill off their blood cells. This can be found through blood tests but among the signs are yellowing of the skin/gums, tiredness, loss of appetite, and loss of balance that occurs over two days.\n\n\n=== Life span ===\nThe UK Kennel Club survey puts the median lifespan of a Shih Tzu at 13 years and 2 months, with most living 10 to 16 years. The oldest living Shih Tzu was Smokey from Florida. Smokey lived to be 23 years old.\n\n\n== Variations ==\n\n\n=== Kennel club differences ===\nThere is a difference between the Shih Tzu of the American Kennel Club and the Kennel Club (UK) :\n\n\n==== The AKC (American Kennel Club) Shih-Tzu ====\nTheir front legs (forequarters) are straight. Their hindquarters are muscular. Neither should be too short nor too long.\nThe standard head is big and round and is set high with face looking forward or up.\nThe neck and body are the most important and should not be exaggerated.\nThe eyes are large and face the front.\nThe shoulders of the American type of Shih-Tzu are frontal.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUtility Group\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShih Tzu at Curlie"}, {"id": 441, "name": "Shikoku (dog)", "country": "Japan", "type": "Northern Breed", "picture": "dog441", "description": "The Shikoku (\u56db\u56fd\u72ac, Shikoku-ken, alternative names: Kochi-ken, Mikawa Inu, Japanese Wolfdog) is a native, primitive Japanese breed of dog from Shikoku island that is similar to a Shiba Inu. The Shikoku was recently added as recognized breed of the American Kennel Club as an AKC FSS standard [ Foundation Stock Service ], it is recognized by the Japan Kennel Club, an organization recognized by AKC as an official foreign registry (AKC recognizes the Shiba Inu, however). The Shikoku is also in the Canadian Kennel Club Hound group and the United Kennel Club, awaiting full recognition.  In 1937 the Japanese Crown recognized the Shikoku dog as a living \"natural monument\" of Japan.\n\n\n== Comparison to other Japanese breeds ==\nThe Shikoku is one of the six native Japanese breeds, it is intermediate in size between the large Akita Inu and the small Shiba Inu; all are within the Spitz family of dogs. The Shikoku was bred mainly for hunting deer and boar in the mountainous districts of Kochi Prefecture. It is sometimes called \"Kochi-ken\" and, along with the Kishu dog, referred to as a boar hound.\nA study of the 1930s carried out by the Japanese cynologist Haruo Isogai classified all native Japanese dog breeds into three categories: large-, medium-, and small-sized. The Shikoku belongs to the Shika-inus, the medium-sized dogs. Other medium-sized dogs are the Kai Ken, the Ainu and the Kishu Inu. They are all very similar with overlapping colors and only minor differences in size and morphology.\nIt also served as the partial ancestor to the Tosa after it was crossed with European breeds such as the Great Dane, Old English Bulldog, English Mastiff, St. Bernard (dog) and others.\n\n\n== Characteristics and temperament ==\n\nIt is cautious and brave with good judgment. It is also loyal to its master. It has sharper features than most Japanese dogs and is sometimes allowed to chase wild boar so it will maintain its nature.\nShikoku dogs are tough and sufficiently agile to run through a mountainous region. They are the ideal companion for active outdoor people. They are very energetic and active outside but they are calm and quiet indoors. The Shikoku is a very intelligent dog and a quick learner. They are not as stubborn and independent as the other native Japanese breeds, but still it is not a dog for every person.\nThe Shikoku stands 17\u201321 inches (43\u201353 cm) high and comes in sesame (red, black), black and tan (nonstandard color), or cream (nonstandard color). These colors consist usually of a light brown, a light red-brown, or a light black-brown. In addition, there is a cream colored coat that tends to be very rare. In all of these colors there is usually a mixture of white found around the underside of the body, near the eyes, snout, and legs.  The Shikoku tends to shed its coat at least one to two times a year. The dog has a fairly thick coat with pointed ears and a curved tail. The body conformation is typically of the spitz-type: the square body, the wedge-shaped head, the prick triangular ears, and feathered curled tail.\nThe Shikoku dog is somewhat unusual in its appearance. It looks similar to a Siberian Husky dog physically, but differs in its size and color. The Shikoku Inu ranges from thirty to fifty-five pounds (male; approximately 20 inches tall; female; approximately 18.5 inches tall). This dog would be considered medium-sized.\n\n\n== Varieties ==\nThree varieties of this breed have been identified: the Awa, the Hongawa, and the Hata all named after the area where they were bred on the island of Shikoku. The Hongawa breeding area being the most remote and least accessible, the dogs of the Hongawa line maintained the highest degree of purity and was considered the best type.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFirst Shikoku Dog\nShikoku Canada\nShikoku Dog Website\nShikoku Inu @ The Canine Information Library\nNorth American Shikoku Club (NASC)"}, {"id": 442, "name": "Shiloh Shepherd dog", "country": "United States", "type": "", "picture": "dog442", "description": "The Shiloh Shepherd is a new dog breed that is still under development. They are not recognized by any major kennel club, but may be shown in some rare breed organizations.\nShiloh Shepherds are larger and have a straighter back than most modern German Shepherd Dogs; they are bred for intelligence, size, and stable temperaments.  Their coats can be a variety of colors and color mixes.  They compete in obedience, agility and herding events and work as therapy dogs, search and rescue dogs, livestock guardians and service assistance.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nAccording to the breed standard, the Shiloh Shepherd should have a regal bearing that shows intelligence and strength. The balance between elegance and strength is the key to their distinct appearance and fluid movement. Their larger size should not impede their movement or grace.\nThe head should be broad and slightly domed with a gradually tapering muzzle; bite alignment is important since either an over or undershot bite is a disqualifying fault.  Muzzles and lips should be black; though pink has been seen, it is a fault.  Ears should be firm, triangular and well cupped; they are carried erect when at attention. Their eyes are always a shade of dark to light brown; no other eye colors are bred.\nTheir broad and muscular backs should be straight with a gradual slope from the withers that complements their full chest.  Tails should be long, plush and slightly curved; they may show a more pronounced curve when the dog is excited or exercising but should never be a ring or a hook shape.\n\n\n==== Size standards ====\nThe Shiloh Shepherd is powerfully built and well-balanced and should have a proud carriage and smooth, effortless gait. The male Shiloh stands 30 inches (76 cm) or more in height with a minimum of 28 inches (71 cm); he weighs 120 to 140 pounds (54\u201365 kg) with a minimum of 110 pounds (50 kg). The female is smaller, standing 28 inches (71 cm) or more in height with a minimum of 26 inches (66 cm) and weighing 100 to 120 pounds (45\u201354 kg) with a minimum of 80 pounds (36 kg). With their even proportions, Shilohs should appear longer than they are tall. They are bigger than German Shepherd Dogs.\n\n\n==== Coat types ====\nShilohs come in two distinct coat varieties: the smooth or double coat and the plush coat. The smooth coat should be of medium length and lie close to the body; the hair at the neck and on the back of the fore and hind legs may be longer and thicker than other areas.  The outer coat will be dense, straight, and harsh. The plush coat is longer, with a soft undercoat and a distinctive \"mane\" which extends to the chest.  The body coat should not be over 5 inches (12.5 cm) long but will have feathering inside the ears and behind the legs which should not be over 3 inches (7.5 cm) long.\nThe smooth coat is easier to groom, though the plush coat may shed less. For show purposes, the tufts that grow between the toes and pads must be trimmed.  Coats that are open, wooly or curly are serious faults.\n\n\n==== Coat colors ====\nShilohs come in a wide range of coat colors.  They may be bi or dual colored in black with tan, golden tan, reddish tan, silver, or sable.  They can also be solid golden, silver, red, dark brown, dark grey, or black sable. Solid black and solid white are possible, but for show purposes, the nose, lips, and eye rims must be solid black.  Blue and liver colors are possible but not bred for since they are disqualifying faults.Shilohs may have a small white blaze on the chest or white on the toes, but white in any other area is a fault.  To meet the standard, this should blend in with the lighter color of their coat.  Pale, washed-out colours are discouraged.\n\n\n==== Movement and gait ====\nThe Shiloh's gait is smooth and rhythmic.  Their long strides and flowing motion require good muscular development and shows in its prime when the dog reaches maturity. Even while in a flying trot, the straightness of their back should be maintained.  The full trot is steady and level, without swaying or rolling.  To help keep their balance, their feet are brought in toward their middle line when running. Forward reach of the dog should be as long as possible, ideally extending past the nose, giving the Shiloh the impression of \"flying\". Faults in movement or carriage are serious.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nBred as companions, Shilohs have loyal and outgoing personalities.  Many of the breeders in the United States operate out of large farms where the puppies are introduced to a large variety of animals. They were developed to be gentle and loving, able to work with animals and children, while still possessing a trainable drive for working applications, such as assistive service, obedience, or herding.   Shiloh Shepherds are reported to be the least territorial when compared to other Shepherd breeds. With proper socialization they adapt easily to a variety of environments and are stable.  Extreme aggression or shyness is severely penalized in the breed standard.\n\n\n== Health ==\nShilohs have an average life span of 9\u201314 years, on par with the German Shepherd Dog breed.\nAs with other large/giant breed dogs, Shilohs may experience problems with gastric dilatation volvulus, also known as bloat. When young, it is especially recommended that Shilohs be fed a consistent diet of high quality food due to their sensitive stomachs.  Small intestine bacterial overgrowth syndrome has also been reported and can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain and difficulty absorbing nutrients from food.  Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is another health concern although manageable with digestive enzyme supplementation. Each condition is serious and should be treated immediately by a veterinarian.Though less prone to them than German Shepherds, Shilohs are susceptible to hip dysplasia and other skeletal disorders.  Due to slow bone growth, if Shilohs  are introduced to strenuous activities before maturity that impact the joints, serious injuries can occur. An exhaustive and detailed genetic breeding program has greatly reduced the incidence of hip and elbow dysplasia. \n Panosteitis may occur during a Shiloh's growth stages.\n\n\n== Titling and competition ==\nUsing their speed and balance, Shilohs perform agility related activities with ease.  However, due to slower bone growth they should not perform strenuous obstacles or jumping until they reach maturity.\nShilohs have herding instincts that make them excellent partners in the  arena.  Shilohs have been recognized by the American Herding Breed Association (AHBA) since 2004.  The AHBA's preliminary test for Herding Instinct is used to determine if a Shiloh has the instincts and interest for herding.Shilohs have been trained as search and rescue dogs.  In March 2007, a Shiloh named Gandalf received national media attention after finding a Boy Scout lost in the mountains of North Carolina.\n\nShilohs' gentleness and calm temperament allow them to be a part of therapy work. Their intelligence and willingness to please make them highly suitable for work as assistance dogs. They respond quickly to training and retain the capacity to make independent decisions when situations change.   They are frequent recipients of the AKCs \"Canine Good Citizen\" Award and have been awarded the Companion Dog title, the Companion Dog Excellent title, the Utility Dog title and been certified as Reading Education Assistance Dogs.Shilohs are easy to handle and even children can be successful in the show ring.  Currently Shilohs can be shown in the American Rare Breed Association, the International All Breed Canine Association, Rarities Inc., the Rare Breed Club of South Western Ontario, the National Kennel Club, and the National Canine Association, as well as special shows by two Shiloh dog clubs and an annual homecoming held by the breed founder.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Shiloh Shepherd was developed by Tina M. Barber of Shiloh Shepherds (kennel) in New York, United States.  In 1974, she began developing a new line of German Shepherd Dog.  Her goal was to preserve the type of dog she remembered from her childhood in Germany: dogs that are good family companions, intelligent, both physically and mentally sound, and large in size.Tina separated her foundation stock from the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1990, and the FIC (Federation of International Canines) agreed to register these dogs as a separate breed. (FIC, which has appeared on multiple warning lists of bogus, \"puppy mill\" pedigree registries, is not to be confused with the world-recognized F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, FCI.)  The name chosen for these dogs was  \"Shiloh Shepherd\" after the kennel of origin. Shortly thereafter, the Shiloh Shepherd Dog Club of America (SSDCA) was formed to preserve and protect the future welfare of the breed. In 1991, the International Shiloh Shepherd Registry (ISSR) was established and took over registry functions from the FIC.In 1993, The Complete Computer Place (TCCP), using a specially designed database program, officially started maintaining breeding records.  This program tracked nine generations of pedigree and LMX (Littermate X-Ray Program) data and computerized all the older paper files. The ISSR used this program to document vital data on each Shiloh Shepherd in its registry.  Tina Barber was active in the development of the breed as the President of the SSDCA, Inc. and Breed Warden for the ISSR. Tina Barber died at the age of 63 on May 30, 2011 in Warsaw, New York.  Lisa Barber (daughter) has assumed the role of Breed Warden and Registrar of the ISSR since the death of her mother.\nIn 1997, during a period when the SSDCA was inactive, The International Shiloh Shepherd Dog Club (ISSDC) was opened.  In  1998, the ISSDC opened their own registry, calling it the ISSDCr.  The Shiloh Shepherd Breed Association (SSBA) was opened shortly after and assumed registry functions for the ISSDCr.  The National Shiloh Breed Registry (NSBR) was established in 2001 and The Shiloh Shepherd Registry (TSSR) in 2002.  In 2004, the ISSDC was reorganized as a parent club for the NSBR, the SSBA, and the TSSR.  In June 2009, the SSBA was closed.There are significant differences of opinion between the founding club and registry and subsequently established clubs and registries as to how best serve the breed.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nISSR Inc.

The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family. With proper training, they make great home pets and sled dogs. It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings.\nThe original Siberian Huskies were bred by the Chukchi people \u2014 whose hunter-gatherer culture relied on their help. It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, whose ancestors lived in the extremely cold and harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic. William Goosak, a Russian fur trader, introduced them to Nome, Alaska during the Nome Gold Rush, initially as sled dogs. The people of Nome referred to Siberian Huskies as \"Siberian Rats\" due to their size of 40\u201350 lb (18\u201323 kg), versus the Malamutes  size of 75\u201385 lb (34\u201339 kg).\n\n\n== Lineage ==\n\nThe first dogs arrived in the Americas 12,000 years ago; however, people and their dogs did not settle in the Arctic until the Paleo-Eskimo people 4,500 years ago and then the Thule people 1,000 years ago, both originating from Siberia. The Siberian Husky was originally developed by the Chukchi people of the Chukchi Peninsula in eastern Siberia. They were brought to Nome, Alaska, in 1908 for sled-dog racing.In 1989, a study was made of ancient canid remains dated to the Late Pleistocene and early Holocene that had been uncovered by miners decades earlier around Fairbanks, Alaska. These were identified as Canis lupus and described as \"short-faced wolves\". The collection was separated into those specimens that looked more wolf-like (i.e. the Beringian wolf), and those that looked more dog-like and in comparison to the skulls of Eskimo dogs from both Greenland and Siberia thought to be their forerunners.In 2015, a study using a number of genetic markers indicated that the Siberian Husky, the Alaskan Malamute and the Alaskan husky share a close genetic relationship between each other and were related to Chukotka sled dogs from Siberia. They were separate to the two Inuit dogs, the Canadian Eskimo Dog and the Greenland dog. In North America, the Siberian Husky and the Malamute both had maintained their Siberian lineage and had contributed significantly to the Alaskan husky, which showed evidence of crossing with European breeds that were consistent with this breed being created in post-colonial North America.Nearly all dog breeds' genetic closeness to the gray wolf is due to admixture. However, several Arctic dog breeds show a genetic closeness with the now-extinct Taymyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture. These breeds are associated with high latitudes - the Siberian Husky and Greenland dog that are also associated with arctic human populations and to a lesser extent, the Shar Pei and Finnish spitz. An admixture graph of the Greenland dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material, however an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data. This indicates admixture between the Taymyr wolf population and the ancestral dog population of these 4 high-latitude breeds. This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Coat ===\n\nA Siberian Husky's coat is thicker than that of most other dog breeds, comprising two layers: a dense undercoat and a longer topcoat of short, straight guard hairs. It protects the dogs effectively against harsh Arctic winters, but the coat also reflects heat in the summer. It is able to withstand temperatures as low as \u221250 to \u221260 \u00b0C (\u221258 to \u221276 \u00b0F). The undercoat is often absent during shedding. Their thick coats require weekly grooming.Siberian Huskies come in a variety of colors and patterns, usually with white paws and legs, facial markings, and tail tip. The most common coats are black and white, then less common copper-red and white, grey and white, pure white, and the rare \"agouti\" coat, though many individuals have blondish or piebald spotting. Striking masks, spectacles, and other facial markings occur in wide variety. Merle coat patterns are not allowed. The American Kennel Club allows all coat colors from black to pure white.\n\n\n=== Eyes ===\n\nThe American Kennel Club describes the Siberian Husky's eyes as \"an almond shape, moderately spaced and set slightly obliquely.\" The AKC breed standard is that eyes may be brown, blue or black; one of each or Particoloured are acceptable (complete is heterochromia). These eye-color combinations are considered acceptable by the American Kennel Club. The parti-color does not affect the vision of the dog.\n\n\n=== Nose ===\nShow-quality dogs are preferred to have neither pointed nor square noses. The nose is black in gray dogs, tan in black dogs, liver in copper-colored dogs, and may be light tan in white dogs. In some instances, Siberian Huskies can exhibit what is called \"snow nose\" or \"winter nose.\" This condition is called hypopigmentation in animals. \"Snow nose\" is acceptable in the show ring.\n\n\n=== Tail ===\n\nSiberian Husky tails are heavily furred; these dogs will often curl up with their tails over their faces and noses in order to provide additional warmth. As pictured, when curled up to sleep the Siberian Husky will cover its nose for warmth, often referred to as the \"Siberian Swirl\". The tail should be expressive, held low when the dog is relaxed, and curved upward in a \"sickle\" shape when excited or interested in something. It should be symmetrical, and not curved or deviated to the side; the tail can curl enough to touch the back.\n\n\n=== Size ===\nThe breed standard indicates that the males of the breed are ideally between 21 and 24 inches (53 and 61 cm) tall at the withers and weighing between 45 and 60 pounds (20 and 27 kg). Females are smaller, growing to between 20 to 22 inches (51 to 56 cm) tall at the withers and weighing between 35 to 50 pounds (16 to 23 kg).\n\n\n=== Behavior ===\nThe Husky howls rather than barks. They have been described as escape artists, which can include digging under, chewing through, or even jumping over fences.Because the Siberian Husky had been raised in a family setting by the Chukchi and not left to fend for themselves they could be trusted with children. The ASPCA classifies the breed as good with children. It also states they exhibit high energy indoors, have special exercise needs, and may be destructive \"without proper care\".Siberian Huskies have a high prey drive due to the Chukchi allowing them to roam free in the summer. The dogs hunted in packs and preyed on wild cats, birds, and squirrels, but with training can be trusted with other small animals. They would only return to the Chukchi villages when the snow returned and food became scarce. Their hunting instincts can still be found in the breed today.A 6 ft (1.83 m) fence is recommended for this breed as a pet, although some have been known to overcome fences as high as 8 ft (2.44 m). Electric pet fencing may not be effective. They need the frequent companionship of people and other dogs, and their need to feel as part of a pack is very strong.\n\n\n== Health ==\nA 1999 ASPCA publication shows the average life span of the Siberian Husky is 12 to 14 years. Health issues in the breed are mainly genetic, such as seizures and defects of the eye (juvenile cataracts, corneal dystrophy, canine glaucoma and progressive retinal atrophy) and congenital laryngeal paralysis. Hip dysplasia is not often found in this breed; however, as with many medium or larger-sized canines, it can occur. The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals currently has the Siberian Husky ranked 155th out of a possible 160 breeds at risk for hip dysplasia, with only two percent of tested Siberian Huskies showing dysplasia.Siberian Huskies used for sled racing may also be prone to other ailments, such as gastric disease, bronchitis or bronchopulmonary ailments (\"ski asthma\"), and gastric erosions or ulcerations.Modern Siberian Huskies registered in the US are largely the descendants of the 1930 Siberia imports and of Leonhard Seppala\u2019s dogs, particularly Togo. The limited number of registered foundational dogs has led to some discussion about their vulnerability to the founder effect.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Siberian Husky, Samoyed, and Alaskan Malamute are all breeds directly descended from the original sled dog. It is thought that the term \"husky\" is a corrupted of the nickname \"Esky\" once applied to the Eskimo and subsequently to their dogs.Breeds descending from the Eskimo dog or Qimmiq were once found throughout the Northern Hemisphere from Siberia to Canada, Alaska, Greenland, Labrador, and Baffin Island.With the help of Siberian Huskies, entire tribes of people were able not only to survive, but to push forth into terra incognita. Admiral Robert Peary of the United States Navy was aided by this breed during his expeditions in search of the North Pole.Dogs from the Anadyr River and surrounding regions were imported into Alaska from 1908 (and for the next two decades) during the gold rush for use as sled dogs, especially in the \"All-Alaska Sweepstakes,\" a 408-mile (657-km) distance dog sled race from Nome, to Candle, and back. Smaller, faster and more enduring than the 100- to 120-pound (45- to 54-kg) freighting dogs then in general use, they immediately dominated the Nome Sweepstakes. Leonhard Seppala, the foremost breeder of Siberian Huskies of the time, participated in competitions from 1909 to the mid-1920s.\n\nOn February 3, 1925, Gunnar Kaasen was first in the 1925 serum run to Nome to deliver diphtheria serum from Nenana, over 600 miles to Nome. This was a group effort by several sled-dog teams and mushers, with the longest (91 miles or 146 km) and most dangerous segment of the run covered by Leonhard Seppala. The event is also loosely depicted in the 1995 animated film Balto, as the name of Gunnar Kaasen's lead dog in his sled team was Balto, although unlike the real dog, Balto the character was portrayed as half wolf in the film. In honor of this lead dog, a bronze statue was erected at Central Park in New York City. The plaque upon it is inscribed, Dedicated to the indomitable spirit of the sled dogs that relayed antitoxin six hundred miles over rough ice, across treacherous waters, through Arctic blizzards from Nenana to the relief of stricken Nome in the winter of 1925. Endurance \u00b7 Fidelity \u00b7 Intelligence\nIn 1930, exportation of the dogs from Siberia was halted. The same year saw recognition of the Siberian Husky by the American Kennel Club. Nine years later, the breed was first registered in Canada. The United Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1938 as the \"Arctic Husky,\" changing the name to Siberian Husky in 1991. Seppala owned a kennel in Nenana before moving to New England, where he became partners with Elizabeth Ricker. The two co-owned the Poland Springs kennel and began to race and exhibit their dogs all over the Northeast.\nAs the breed was beginning to come to prominence, in 1933 Navy Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd brought about 50 Siberian Huskies with him on an expedition in which he hoped to journey around the 16,000-mile coast of Antarctica. Many of the dogs were trained at Chinook Kennels in New Hampshire. Called Operation Highjump, the historic trek proved the worth of the Siberian Husky due to its compact size and greater speeds. Siberian Huskies also served in the United States Army's Arctic Search and Rescue Unit of the Air Transport Command during World War II. Their popularity was sustained into the 21st century. They were ranked 16th among American Kennel Club registrants in 2012, rising to 14th place in 2013.The original sled dogs bred and kept by the Chukchi were thought to have gone extinct, but Benedict Allen, writing for Geographical magazine in 2006 after visiting the region, reported their survival. His description of the breeding practiced by the Chukchi mentions selection for obedience, endurance, amiable disposition, and sizing that enabled families to support them without undue difficulty.\n\nSiberians gained in popularity with the story of the \"Great Race of Mercy,\" the 1925 serum run to Nome, featuring Balto and Togo. Although Balto is considered the more famous, being the dog that delivered the serum to Nome after running the final 53-mile leg, it was Togo who made the longest run of the relay, guiding his musher Leonhard Seppala on a 91-mile journey that included crossing the deadly Norton Sound to Golovin.\nThe bronze statue of Balto that has been displayed in New York City\u2019s Central Park since 1925 is one of its enduringly popular features.Several purebred Siberian Huskies portrayed Diefenbaker, the \"half-wolf\" companion to RCMP Constable Benton Fraser, in the CBS/Alliance Atlantis TV series Due South.In 1960, the US Army undertook a project to construct an under the ice facility for defense and space research, Camp Century, part of Project Iceworm involved a 150+ crew who also brought with them an unofficial mascot, a Siberian Husky named Mukluk.Siberian Huskies are the mascots of the athletic teams of several schools and colleges, including: St. Cloud State University (St. Cloud State Huskies, Blizzard), Northern Illinois University (Northern Illinois Huskies, Victor), the University of Connecticut (Connecticut Huskies, Jonathan), Northeastern University (Northeastern Huskies, Paws), the Michigan Technological University (Michigan Tech Huskies, Blizzard) and University of Washington (Washington Huskies, Harry), and Houston Baptist University (Kiza the Husky).\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe animated series Road Rovers features Exile who is a Siberian Husky. The show Krypto the Superdog features Tusky Husky. The film Eight Below features six Siberian Huskies whose names are Max, Maya, Truman, Old Jack, Dewey and Shorty. In the horror television series Z Nation, a character adopts a Siberian Husky after its owner freezes to death outside his base, and the other dog turned into a zombie. Everest in the animated series PAW Patrol is a Siberian Husky.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlaskan Husky\nAlaskan Klee Kai\nAlaskan Malamute\nCanadian Eskimo Dog\nGreenland dog\nLaika (dog breed)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSiberian Husky at Curlie\nDogs like Huskies"}, {"id": 444, "name": "Silken Windhound", "country": "United States", "type": "Sighthound and Pariah", "picture": "dog444", "description": "The Silken Windhound is an American breed of sighthound. Like most sighthounds, Silkens are noted coursers.\n\n\n== Traits ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nSilken Windhounds are graceful, small to medium sized sighthounds with silky coats of middling length. Silkens have many coat colors that can range from spotted to solid.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nSilken Windhounds are affectionate and playful and are good dogs  for families with children. Owing to their friendliness, they are not good guard dogs but are easily house broken and can be trained to live with smaller household pets. Silkens particularly like agility, therapy, flyball, and obedience.\n\n\n== Training ==\n\nSilken Windhounds are often intelligent and easily trained using reward and affection in short, positive sessions and will work eagerly and form strong relationships with their owners if so treated. Like many sighthounds, Silken Windhounds can slip out of buckle collars, so most owners favour semi-slip collars.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nSilken Windhounds typically live into their middle to late teens. Bone and joint ailments like hip dysplasia and bloat are rare. Some in the Silken Windhound breed are sensitive to ivermectin and related drugs; a simple test is now available to find whether a dog carries a defective MDR1, a multi-drug resistance gene.  Responsible breeders are working to remove this gene from studs.  Some owners report cases of cryptorchidism, umbilical hernia, lotus syndrome, and deafness, and cataracts in old dogs.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSilken Windhounds were founded and developed by Francie Stull, a successful breeder of show and performance American Kennel Club (AKC) Borzoi and Deerhounds, using her favored Borzoi and Whippet bloodlines. The first Silken Windhound litter was whelped in 1985 and a breed club, the International Silken Windhound Society, was formed in 1999. In early 2011, Silken Windhounds were recognized by the United Kennel Club. Silkens are now in multiple countries as well.\n\n\n== Events ==\n\nSilken Windhounds participate in performance sports and showings worldwide, including the NAKC, IABCA, and NCA, as part of the hound group. In Slovenia, Silkens are an accepted part of the Slovenian Kennel Club, member of the FCI, also in the hound group. Silken Windhounds also participate in sighthound performance sports, competing alongside other sighthounds in Finnish lure coursing and straight racing events. The ISWS has established straight and oval track racing programs that enable Silkens to compete and win points towards performance titles.\nIn late 2009, Silken Windhounds were accepted as a Limited Stakes breed in the ASFA. Over forty dogs competed in ASFA limited stakes in their first month of acceptance.\nIn late 2010, Silken Windhounds were accepted as a breed in NOFCA, the National Open Field Coursing Association, and can participate in open field events. On March 18, 2011, Silken Windhounds were accepted into the United Kennel Club.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 445, "name": "Sinhala Hound", "country": "Sri Lanka", "type": "", "picture": "dog445", "description": "The Sinhala Hound or Sinhalese Hound is a breed of dog from Sri Lanka, and parts of India.\nThe skeletal remains of dogs from Nilgala cave and from Bellanbandi Palassa, dating from the Mesolithic era, about 4500 BC, suggest that Balangoda Man may have kept domestic dogs for driving game.

The shorter hair of the head veils the forehead and eyes, forming a moderate beard. The ears are generally well feathered and, in prick-eared examples, the hair normally falls like a fringe, accenting the form, and blending with the side locks.\n\n\n=== Colour ===\nFawn, blue, dark or light grey, blonde, and black with black points (ears and muzzle) all occur. They may have any self colour, allowing for some shading of same colour on the body and a lighter undercoat, so long as the nose and ears are black. There is generally no further patterning on the body, but a small white spot on the chest is relatively common.\n\n\n=== Types ===\nExcept for the shape and size of the ears, there is no significant difference nor preference given between the prick- and drop-eared types. When prick, they are medium-sized, carried high on the skull and angled slightly outwards.\n\n\n== Upkeep ==\n\nThe Skye Terrier is a hunting dog and enjoys a daily outing, exploring in a safe area. It also needs a short to moderate walk with its owner to stay in shape. The Skye enjoys life as a housedog, and prefers not to live outdoors. So, owners should not keep them outdoors as their natural habitats. Regular combing (about twice a week) is all that is needed to keep the Skye looking well and detangled. Many owners think that an occasional bath will soften the coat, as is often the case with other terriers, but that is not the case. An occasional bath will not soften the coat too much. Owners must pay attention to the area around their eyes and mouth, this may need frequent cleaning.\n\n\n== Health ==\nIf a Skye is exercised too often, too young, especially before 8 months, they can damage their bone growth, leading to a painful limp and possibly badly bowed legs. Jumping up and down from objects, climbing over objects, running, even long walks, are all things to be avoided for the first 8 to 10 months to prevent later problems and allow for correct closure of the growth plate.\nDegenerative disc disease is also a common problem in short-legged dogs; as many as 10% of Skyes will suffer from it.\nMammary cancer is the leading cause of Skye Terrier deaths, with hemangiosarcomas (a malignant tumour of the blood vessels), autoimmune disease, and hyperthyroidism as other concerns of the breed.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nScotland has long been a stronghold of small plucky terriers, and the Skye Terrier is among the oldest of them. They developed along the west coastal area, where they hunted fox and otter.The purest of these dogs were found on the Isle of Skye, and the dogs were then named Skye Terriers. Skye Terriers were first described in the sixteenth century, when it was already noteworthy for its long coat. Some confusion exists in tracing its history because, for a certain time, several different breeds had the same name \"Skye Terrier\". The loyal dog, present under the petticoat of Mary, Queen of Scots at her execution, has been ascribed as a Skye Terrier. In 1840, Queen Victoria made the breed fancy, keeping both drop-(floppy) and prick-(upwards) eared dogs. A colour lithograph of Skye Terriers was included in \"The Illustrated Book of the Dog\" by Vero Shaw in 1881.This greatly increased its popularity and the Skye Terrier came to America due to this. The AKC recognized the breed in 1887, and it quickly appeared on the show scene. Its popularity has significantly dropped and now it is one of the least known terriers. There is little awareness of its former popularity.\n\n\n== Under threat ==\nThere are concerns that the breed is under threat of extinction with only 30 born in the UK in 2005. It is today the most endangered of the Vulnerable Native Breeds of that country, and within 40 years the breed may disappear completely.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of domesticated Scottish breeds\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSkye Terrier at Curlie"}, {"id": 447, "name": "Sloughi", "country": "Morocco", "type": "Sighthound and Pariah", "picture": "dog447", "description": "The Sloughi  (Berber language: o\u1e63kay or occay) is a North African breed of dog, specifically a member of the sighthound family. It is found mainly in Morocco, which is responsible for the standard, and may be found in smaller numbers elsewhere in North Africa.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Sloughi is a medium-large, short-haired, smooth-coated, athletic sighthound developed in the Berber world of North Africa (in the area including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya) to hunt game such as hare, fox, jackal, gazelle, and wild pigs. It is an ancient breed, treasured in North Africa for its hunting skills, speed, agility, and endurance over long distances. It is a robust, but elegant and racy, pursuit dog with no exaggeration of length of body or limbs, muscle development, angulation, nor curve of loin. The Sloughi is not a fragile dog, but is also a dog with class and grace. The attitude is noble and somewhat aloof, and the expression of the dark eyes is gentle and melancholy.\nThe Sloughi's head is long and elegant with drop ears. The body and legs show defined bony structure and strong, lean muscles. The skeletal structure is sturdy. The topline is essentially horizontal blending into a bony, gently sloping croup. The tail is long and carried low with an upward curve at the end.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nConsistent with many sighthounds, the Sloughi has a sensitive character that is devoted to its owner and family.  It does not respond well to harsh or corporal training methods and does best with an owner who is also sensitive, intelligent and conscientious. The Sloughi responds best to training that is based on positive reinforcement.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Sloughi is largely unchanged from ancient times, and so retains a robust genetic health. Only a few genetic conditions have been confirmed in the breed.  These include certain autoimmune disorders, such as Addison's disease and irritable bowel syndrome and progressive retinal atrophy. The Sloughi is one of the breeds for whom a genetic test for progressive retinal atrophy has been developed to with a simple blood test.  Like all sighthounds, the Sloughi is very sensitive to anesthesia, and can be sensitive to vaccines, worming, and other medications\u2014so these routine treatments should be spaced apart instead of given all at once. The breed tends to enjoy excellent health into old age.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIt is thought that Sloughis originally came from what is today Ethiopia (ancient tributes to the pharaohs included smooth Lop-eared Sighthounds from Nubia, south of Egypt). On old fragments of earthenware (about 3000 B.C.), a short-haired sighthound with lop ears was discovered that resembles a Sloughi. In 2008, a DNA study indicated that the Sloughi is a genetically unique population of sighthounds and the genetic sequences it shares with the Basenji, Sica, and Nguni indicate that this breed is, on the maternal side, embedded in Africa, possibly for thousands of years. Therefore, it should not to be confused with the smooth Saluki of the Arabian peninsula and the Middle East, nor to be confused with the smooth Afghan Hound. The Sloughi was and still is used for hunting in its native countries, and also is a reliable guard dog. Today, the Sloughi is found mainly in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. Morocco is responsible for the breed's FCI Standard. \nThe Sloughi received full recognition by the American Kennel Club as of January 1, 2016 when it became eligible to compete in the AKC Hound Group.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Sloughi:  The Arabian Sighthound\", 1996, by Ermine Moreau-Sipiere, Alet Publishing.\n\"Sloughi\", 2004, by Dr. M.-D Crapon de Caprona, Kennel Club books\n\"The Sloughi 1852-1952\" 2008, by Dr. M.-D.

This mountain dog\u2014also known as Slovensky Cuvac, Slovak Chuvach, Tatransky Cuvac and Slovensky Kuvac\u2014is closely related to the Hungarian Kuvasz. The alternate German and English spelling Tchouvatch reflects the pronunciation: chew-votch. The breed is recognised under sponsorship from Slovakia by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale with the name Slovensk\u00fd \u010duva\u010d. Despite the multiple renderings in English, these refer to only one breed. The United Kennel Club in the US uses the English version of the name Slovak Cuvac.\n\n\n== History ==\nSlovak sheep farming has a very old tradition.  The Slovak Cuvac, together with mountain sheep, the Hucul horse, and typical inhabitants of the mountains, formed the fundamental economic preconditions for the utilization of pastures for cattle. The inhabitants of the Slovak mountains were mostly free people who defended the frontiers and paid duties in sheep's cheese. The institution of these people was called \"Valassky Opasok\" and its center, until the abolition of serfdom, was Ko\u0161ice. The members of this shepherd military system did their service on mountain meadows with their companions - the hearty white dog called the Slovak Cuvac.\nA good watchdog, guard, shepherd and companion, the dog proved itself also in watching cattle, turkeys, and other domestic animals - as well as its master's household. Holiday makers and visitors to the mountains and spas took to this breed and began to carry it to the lowlands.The Slovensky Cuvac is used on sheep farms and mountain ridges as well as homes and frontiers.  He is boundlessly loyal and stout hearted.  He resists every enemy - bears and wolves included.  According to the time honored shepherd's tradition, he is always bred in white to be discernible from the beasts of the night.\nThis breed has been well documented as far back as the 17th century. However, as wolves slowly began to disappear from European mountains and modern herding practices were instituted, the Cuvac was faced with the prospect of being seen as a relic of the past. What few specimens were left in the 1950s were bred carelessly. Credit for reviving the breed and fixing characteristics is due Dr. Antonin Hruza, in cooperation with the veterinary school of Brno.  \nThe registered breeding of the Slovensky Cuvac was established in Czechoslovakia by Professor Antonin Hruza from the Veterinary Faculty in Brno on June 4, 1929.  The Club of the Breeders of Slovak Cuvac was established in 1933 and a written standard was established and approved in 1964 Dr. V. Kurz).  The basic breeding material came from the vicinity of Liptovska Luzna, Kokava and Vychodna as well as from Rachov in the Carpathians.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe body of Slovak Cuvac is slightly longer than higher. Strong and straight ridge goes - way to lower back - a little bit sloped. Strong square butt is slightly sloped, too. The low-placed tail is worn hanging, reaching hock joints. Chest reaching to elbow joint and chest's width can compared to circa one quarter of scapula's height. Ribs are well rounded and achieving long back. Belly and flanks are slightly pulled. Long scapulas are slant laid. The Slovak Cuvac has straight legs placed vertically to his body and well angled. The front paws are compact, rounded. The back paws are a little bit longer. The neck is as long as head.\nThe wide and elongated skull is a little bit arched, but the top of the head is flat. With side view are straight line of top of the head and straight line of nose's ridge parallel. The stop is well apparent. The supra-orbital arcs are marked, the frontal groove is flat. The wide and heavy mouth is slightly narrowed to top of the nose and is a little bit shorter than the skull. The lips fit tightly. The ears are placed high, reclined and fitted tightly to the head. The ear points are rounded. The eyes are oval shaped with caps fitting closely, straight placed at the head. The Cuvac has scissors occlusion.\nThe fur is dense and rich, centre parting at the ridge is not allowed. Covering hair, which is constituted by hair with 5-15 cm length, completely covers the  shorter, dense and soft undercoat. Male dogs have collar around the neck. The fur is pure white. A yellowish tinge by ears is permissible, but not desirable. The eyes are brown. Muzzle, lips edges and eyelids, like the paw pads, are black.  \n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe breed is an animal of imposing stature. It has a large head, half of which is taken up by the nasal canal. It has strong jaws, with a scissors bite. The oval-shaped eyes are dark and lively. The ears are long and hanging while carried on the sides of the head. The tail is thickly furred, and it hangs down when the dog is at rest. The coat is completely white, and the hair can be as much as 4 inches (10 cm) long. \n\n\n=== Height and weight ===\nThe height for males can be as much as 28 inches (70 cm), while females at the most are 26 inches (65 cm) in height. The weight for males ranges 77 - 99 pounds and the weight for females is 66 - 88 pounds.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe dog is known for its hardy constitution, sturdy frame and shaggy white coat.  Its frame is massive, and his temperament is naturally lively, watchful, undaunted and alert. These dogs thrive best in an environment of a large family, children and livestock to care for.  Farms and ranches make the best homes.  These dogs are natural guard dogs. They are gentle and loyal with their family and possessions.\n\n\n== Care ==\nRegular grooming keeps the white coat clean and attractive, and furniture free of white \"mohair\".

In past times the daughter's life was mostly in and around the house, so the Kokoni dog was the \"daughter's dog\" or the \"dog for the house\", unlike the hunting dogs or the livestock guardian dogs.\nIn some places in Greece the word Kokoni is used for any dog incapable of serious working duties (e.g. if a livestock guardian dog shows signs of fear, the shepherd calls it \"kokoni\").\nIn other places in Greece the word Kokoni is used for any small dog.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThis breed of dog is of a medium size ranging from approximately 4\u20138 kilos.  They have dropped ears, short snout, long body, with long curved tail.  This breed also comes in a large array of colors and combinations of colors, such as black and tan, blonde, cream, and white.  They are not yet recognized by the FCI.  They are often confused with the Longhaired Dachshund or a Cocker Spaniel mix.  Their legs are longer than a Dachshund's which raises their belly and chest much more off the ground.  The average height is around 28 centimeters.\n\n\n=== Coat ===\n\nThe coat of the Small Greek Domestic Dog is of three lengths, of very good quality, and is easy to groom. Sometimes, it is slightly wavy, but it should always feel silky.  The coat is rich, dense and weatherproof.\n\n\n=== Tail ===\nThe sickle-shaped tail of the Small Greek Domestic Dog is usually long. The dog holds its tail up high, and has an elegant curve.  It is always in motion, showing the dog's joy. The coat of this dog forms a brush under its tail.\n\n\n=== Eyes ===\nThis breed of dog has large eyes which vary in shape from round to more of an almond shape. They are bright, intelligent, and are not deep-set. The color goes with the color of the coat, but they will never be transparent or blue. \n\n\n=== Muzzle, nose and jaws ===\nThe muzzle \"tapers easily to the nose\", and the topline is level. The nose of the Small Greek Domestic Dog has well-opened nostrils. It is not too large compared to the muzzle, and it is moist, flat, and level on the front surface. The Small Greek Domestic Dog has strong jaws with scissor-bite teeth.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Small Greek Domestic Dog has an even temper and gentle disposition. They are lively, cheerful, amiable and not generally aggressive or timid. They enjoy company, and although they may initially be standoffish with strangers, they are easily won over.  They are very intelligent and are easily trained and famously devoted to their owners.  They are very loving and protective.  They have a loud, strong bark for their size though they do not bark much.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nThis is a deep-chested, sturdy and agile breed, capable of great speeds and valued for its stamina.  The breed has good longevity and lives into their late teens.  Major health issues are unknown.    \n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe blonde dog known as \"Satchel\" in the 2005 movie Bewitched with Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell is a Small Greek Domestic Dog.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlopekis\nCretan Hound\nGreek Harehound\nGreek Shepherd\nList of dog breeds\nKennel Club of Greece\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Kennel Club of Greece's breed standard"}, {"id": 453, "name": "Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier", "country": "Ireland", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog453", "description": "The Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier (Irish: An Brocaire Bu\u00ed) is a pure breed terrier originating from Ireland. Wheatens typically have one of two coat types: Irish or American. The Irish coat is generally silkier and wavier than the American coat, which is thicker and fuller. Wheatens are generally friendly and playful, and tend to get along well with children and other dogs.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Wheaten was bred in Ireland for over two hundred years to be an all-purpose farm dog whose duties included herding, watching and guarding livestock, and vermin hunting and killing. They share a common ancestry with the Kerry Blue Terrier and the Irish Terrier but were not owned by gentry. In Ireland, they were commonly referred to as the \"Poor Man's Wolfhound.\"  Their tails used to be docked to avoid taxes and were often kept to a specific size.Despite its long history, the Wheaten was not recognised as a breed in Ireland by the Irish Kennel Club until 1937. In 1943, the British Kennel Club recognised the breed in the UK as well. The first Wheatens were exported to Lydia Vogel in the United States in the 1940s, but serious interest in the breed took another ten years to develop. In the 1970s, the first Wheatens were imported into Australia by Anubis Kennels. Finally, in 1973, they were recognised by the American Kennel Club. Recent importation of Irish-style dogs have improved and broadened the gene pool. Today, Wheatens compete in obedience, agility, and tracking and are occasionally used in animal-assisted therapy as well.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nPuppies have dark coats of red, brown, mahogany or white. Their muzzles and ears may be black or dark brown. The reddish-brown puppy coat gradually grows out to nearly white before maturing into a wheaten-coloured coat as they get older. The adult coat may contain black, white, or darker brown \"guard\" hairs in addition to the lighter wheaten-coloured hair.  If adults ever have skin injuries, the resulting hair growth will be the dark colour of their puppy coat before it eventually grows out to the wheat color. It may also come out to a molten chocolate colour, either white or milky coloured.\nThe Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier is a medium-sized dog, which ranges on average from 17 to 20 inches (43 to 51 cm) in height and about 30 to 45 pounds (14 to 20 kg) in weight. The breed has a square structure and is well built. Their soft, silky hair does not shed like most dogs; like human hair and Poodle hair, it keeps growing; they do need trimming and should be brushed and combed once a day to avoid mats. They are very smart dogs, and are easy to train. They love people, and they rarely have aggression issues.\n\nThe Irish coat tends to be thinner and silkier than the American variety.  The Irish coat has a devoted following in Ireland and Europe.  Breeders of the pure Irish type believe this is the original working coat. The coat is not thin \u2013 breeders of the Irish type consider the American heavy coat to be \"bouffant\", not that of the original working terrier type. There are a few breeders of the Irish type in the US and Canada.  In the AKC conformation show ring, the judges do not always accept the Irish type well.  The Irish is well received in the UK and Europe.  The \"Heavy Irish\" coat is usually a result of cross breeding between coat types \u2013 American/English coat with an Irish type.  The Irish coat still requires daily brushing to stay free of matted hair.\nThe Wheatens seen in Ireland today are of the same size, shape and coat texture as those seen and documented well over 100 years ago. Evidence of this can be seen from the famous artwork \"The Aran Fisherman's Drowned Child\" by the Irish painter Frederic William Burton.\n\n\n== Health ==\nSoft-coated Wheaten Terriers are generally a long-lived breed. They are susceptible to various heritable diseases, although are most known for two protein wasting conditions: protein-losing nephropathy (PLN), where the dogs lose protein via the kidneys; and protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), where the dogs fail to fully absorb protein in their digestive tracts, causing it to pass in their stool. Both PLN and PLE are potentially fatal, but if caught early enough, can sometimes be managed with strict dietary changes and pharmaceuticals. Laboratory tests can aid in diagnosing PLN and PLE; Wheaten owners should check their country's advised testing protocols. Research suggests that PLE and PLN often are more prevalent in female wheatens and often happen in concurrence, with PLE following diagnosis of PLN. While a genetic predisposition has been suggested, an unknown mode of inheritance remains. Research programs, mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom, are looking for answers.Other Wheaten health issues are renal dysplasia, inflammatory bowel disease, Addison's disease, and cancer. Some Wheatens can suffer from food and environmental allergies, and can be prone to developing the skin disease atopic dermatitis. Potential owners of Wheaten Terriers should discuss health issues with a breeder before deciding to get a puppy.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier is an energetic and playful dog.  It requires patience and consistent positive training. Harsh methods will often result in fear and/or aggression.  A positive, even-handed approach works best with this intelligent yet headstrong terrier.  It is an enthusiastic greeter, and will often jump up to lick a person's face, commonly referred to as the \"Wheaten greetin\".\nWheatens are considered less scrappy than other terriers, but they can be hyper and more active than many other breeds. For this reason these dogs do best when they are exercised regularly. They are cool weather dogs and can become easily overheated in hot weather. If socialised with cats and puppies, they may get along fine with them; if not, care should be taken in introducing them to cats, as the breed has a very strong \"prey drive\" because of its vermin-hunting origin. Wheatens are extremely friendly and loving pets, and get along well with other dogs if properly socialised. Wheatens are very protective of their families and, although they may bark in alert at strangers, they rarely get aggressive. Many Wheaten owners thus say they make great watch dogs, but poor guard dogs. Wheatens are a great dog for children and are generally friendly towards them.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSoft-coated Wheaten Terrier at Curlie"}, {"id": 454, "name": "South Russian Ovcharka", "country": "Russia", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog454", "description": "The South Russian Ovcharka, also known as a Ukrainian Shepherd Dog, or South Russian Sheepdog, is a sheepdog from the Ukrainian steppes between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.\n\nThis mountain dog is an undemanding dog, which can adapt to most weather conditions.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMales should stand no less than 25 inches (64 cm) tall, it has a long head, with dangling, small, triangular ears.

The exact date of its extinction is not known; it is likely that it was gradually interbred with other breeds until the genuine Southern Hound bloodline ceased to exist.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe origins of the Southern Hound are equally unclear. Most writers suggest that it is derived from the Talbot, which was a predominantly white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound, also of uncertain origin, though it is sometimes claimed that it came from Normandy. It is suggested that at some point the Talbot was crossed with Greyhounds to give them an extra turn of speed. However, in The Dog published in 1852, William Youatt states that the Southern Hound may have existed in Britain since ancient times rather than being brought from France by the Normans.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Southern Hound was a tall, heavy dog with a square head, and long ears. It had a deep chest, a long bony body and a deep melodious voice. It was a slow dog, but with excellent scenting abilities and was employed to follow the trail of the quarry during a hunt. Because of its lack of speed and deliberate nature, it was considered best used for hunting game such as hare or deer, which would eventually be exhausted by its relentless pursuit and, unlike a fox or rabbit, could not escape to the safety of a den or burrow.\n\n\n== Popularity and decline ==\nIt was still common south of the River Trent in the 18th century. Further north the North Country Beagle or Northern Hound was favoured. This was a faster dog but probably lacked the delicate nose of the Southern Hound. In his The Dog, in Health and Disease in 1859, \"Stonehenge\" (the pen name of John Henry Walsh, editor of The Field) magazine says the two breeds could be differentiated by the large dewlap present in the Southern Hound, but the illustration of the Southern Hound in the same book lacks this detail. How far the Talbot, Northern Hound and Southern Hound were intermixed is impossible to ascertain: authors writing in the mid-19th century were already having difficulty distinguishing between the three breeds.The Southern Hound seems to have fallen out of favour during the 18th century as the fashion for shorter hunts led to the development of the faster Foxhound. Youatt wrote that there were still packs in use in Devon in the 19th century and that the Southern Hound was sometimes used in conjunction with Foxhound packs to help pick up the cold trail when the pack lost the scent. Some were employed in Wales on polecat hunts (that could last several days), and they appear to have been used to hunt otter before being employed as breeding stock for the development of the Otterhound.\n\n\n== Genetic legacy ==\nThe famous bloodhound breeder Edwin Brough reported that in 1881 he used a pure bred Southern Hound, \"Clara\", like the one pictured in this article as a cross to his bloodhounds, and this outcross was bred on into the modern population of bloodhounds.Many of the modern hound breeds are believed to have Southern Hound blood: Beagles, Harriers, Foxhounds, Coonhounds and Bloodhounds among others.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nLeighton, Robert (2004) [1934].

The mountain dog type has a heavier coat.\n\n\n== Historical context ==\n\nTranshumance in Spain is very ancient, like the primitive populations of those lands and, consequently, the mastiff-transhumance binomial. In the Iron Age of the Castilian Plateau it found skeletons of dogs of enormous dimensions. Also, it is assumed that already in the Neolithic there existed molossers in Central Europe.In different parts of the globe, appeared simultaneously various types of cattle dogs of molosser type, one of these places was Spain considering the natural characteristics of the peninsula. Specifically the Spanish Mastiff was originated in the territories of Asturias, Cantabria, Province of Le\u00f3n and Province of Zamora.Th Indo-Europeans, some groups composed of warriors herders and nomadic transhumans, led to large herd molossers dogs the valleys and areas conducive to grass. In the seasons of transhumance it had to walk about thirty kilometers or more per day, which gathered other nine for grazing; without the ebb and continued during monitoring.With the birth of the farming system, the dogs became indispensable. There was probably external influences acting on the base structure of the native dogs. Through centuries of selection and specialization, and thanks to this ecological ring present in many countries of the world (man, sheep, dog and wolf), it gave life to a specimen of a physical and a useful dog.\nAfter, in Medieval times, during centuries, the mast\u00edn espa\u00f1ol has accompanied the herds of transhumans sheeps that ran ca\u00f1adas reales crossing from north to south Spain, defending the cattle of attack of wolves and other vermin; the mast\u00edn had the protection of carlancas or carrancas, chunky metal necklaces with skewers. Its function was primarily protective, unlike its fellow Carea dogs, whose function is grazing, driving the herds in response to indications of the shepherd  In some places it is known as perro merinero by accompany the Merino sheep breed.\nThe first breed standard of the mast\u00edn was made by the FCI in 1946. In 1981 was created the Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola del Perro Mast\u00edn Espa\u00f1ol, who organized a breeding program looking for the kind of large and strong mastiff of the past times, and drafted a new breed standard focused on recovering the old cattle dogs, fit as pets, and as guard dog and defense.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Spanish mastiff is a very large and powerful dog, similar in appearance to the other mastiff breeds.   They have a large powerful head and serious and vigilant expression\nMales in this breed are 70 to 85 centimetres (28 to 33 in) tall at the withers, and range from 50 to 70 kilograms (110 to 150 lb). Females are at least 65 centimetres (26 in), and weigh 40 to 60 kilograms (88 to 132 lb).It has small eyes and drop ears resembling triangles. This dog's coat is most often fawn-colored, but can also be brindle, black or 'wolf' colored. Reddish tones indicate miscegenation\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThis noble giant is aloof, dignified, calm and intelligent. It is devoted to its family and may politely accept strangers if it has been socialized properly, although it will be wary of them. It can be aggressive toward other dogs. The Spanish mastiff may be a less-than-ideal pet in urban situations, where its booming voice and massive size could be problematic. It is a wonderful protector of its home and family.\nSocialization and training should begin early to ensure this dog a stable and reliable pet. Supervised exposure in puppy-hood to a variety of unfamiliar but non-threatening dogs will help dampen a tendency to aggression toward other dogs. The breed is quite alert and food motivated but can bore easily; training must be consistent and firm but gentle. Once the trainer has established the dog's respect as leader, the Spanish mastiff will be an extremely loyal pet.\n\n\n== Exercise ==\nThis dog is more inclined to lumber than gallop, but it can move quite rapidly when necessary. A long daily walk will be sufficient, although it will appreciate a fenced area where it can exercise at its own rate.\n\n\n== Varieties ==\n\nIn addition to its considered \"official\" variety, which is the current and modern Spanish Mastiff framed in a rigid aesthetic pattern and recognized by the largest canine entities, there is also its more primitive, traditional slope, considered unofficial, and that does not meet any aesthetic standards and has as its objective, still today, to serve its owners acting in the protection of flocks against predators. These unofficial strands, for the purpose of differentiation, are termed traditional Spanish Mastiff, working Spanish Mastiff, Leonese Mastiff, and Wolf Dog. These unofficial strands continue to act actively in their original and primitive function.\n\n\n== Representatives dogs ==\nLas Meninas by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez features an impressive example of the breed.\nActor Viggo Mortensen has, by a gift when he was in Le\u00f3n, both a Carea Leon\u00e9s and a Spanish Mastiff, named \"Aragorn\" and \"Alatriste\", named of characters he played in his movies.\n\n\n== Notes =="}, {"id": 457, "name": "Spanish Water Dog", "country": "Spain", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog457", "description": "The Spanish Water Dog (perro de agua espa\u00f1ol) breed dates back several hundred years and has its origins most likely in Turkey from where it was imported into Spain as a general purpose sheepdog and guard. It is also used sometimes as a gundog, and is skilled at retrieval from water. The SWD has strong genetic links to other ancient water breeds such as the Portuguese Water Dog, the French Barbet and the Irish Water Spaniel.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe SWD is a medium size, athletic, robust dog that is slightly longer than tall. Their tails are usually docked in the US, but undocked tails are not a fault in conformation showing if the dog was bred in a non-docking country.\nThe head should be strong and carried with elegance. The skull is flat and the top is parallel with the top of the muzzle. The nose, eye-rims and paw pads are the same colour as the darkest part of the coat or darker. The eyes are expressive and set fairly wide apart. They should be hazel, chestnut or dark brown in colour, depending on the coat colour. The ears are set at medium height on the skull, and are triangular.\n\n\n==== Coat and colour ====\nIt has a distinctive curly coat which is woolly in texture and may form cords when long. The coat should not be clipped or groomed for aesthetic purposes. Instead, it should look entirely natural, as though it is not groomed at all. It should never be trimmed, but sheared down at least once a year. SWD puppies are always born with curly hair.\n\nThe SWD can be seen in a variety of colours. It may be solid black, beige, brown, or white; bicolour where the second colour is white; or particolour . Tri-coloured dogs are strictly prohibited by the currently held (worldwide) standards for the breed as are black and tan or brown and tan colour combinations.\n\n\n==== Size ====\nThe Spanish Water Dog is a medium-sized dog. The approximate measurements are:\n\nMales\nHeight (at the withers): 44\u201350 cm (17\u201320 in)\nWeight: 18\u201322 kg (40\u201349 lb)\nFemales\nHeight (at the withers): 40\u201345 cm (16\u201318 in)\nWeight: 14\u201318 kg (31\u201340 lb)\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe SWD is diligent, loyal, affectionate, and intelligent. They have very strong natural herding and guarding instincts, leading them to become the \"self-appointed\" guardians of their homes. SWDs thrive on work and play. Their athleticism and extremely hard working nature leads them to excel at any number of tasks. They can be wary with strangers, and early and continuing socialization with a variety of people and other animals is essential for a well-adjusted, social dog. Good socialization at an early age greatly helps them cohabit with small children.\n\n\n== Grooming ==\nSWDs require minimal grooming.\n\nSWDs should never be brushed, instead, as the cords grow they should be checked for matting. When matting does occur they should be gently pulled apart without tearing the cords. If there is too much matting the cords should be sheared.\nSWDs should be bathed only when dirty in lukewarm water. Use a neutral shampoo, never use human shampoo. SWDs should be allowed to air dry.\nThe cords must be sheared one or more times a year.\nEars and eyes should be cleaned as often as they are dirty and excess ear hair may need to be plucked.\nAs with all dogs nails should be trimmed.\nSWD puppies should be trimmed for the first time at around the age of 4 months\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe breed's life expectancy is thought to be about 14 years. Recent health testing has uncovered the following issues:\n\nHip dysplasia\nProgressive retinal atrophy (prcd-PRA)\nHypothyroidism\nHypoadrenocorticism (also known as Addison's disease)\nExocrine pancreatic insufficiency\nAllergies\nCataracts\nCongenital hypothyroidism with goitre (CHG)\nDistichia\nCherry eye\nNeuroaxonal dystrophy\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMany different theories exist as to its origin and history. Records suggest water dogs have been around the main wetlands of the Iberian Peninsula since ancient times. Portuguese and Spanish water dogs are clearly related and have a common ancestor. The SWD has been known by many other names such as \"Perro Turco\", \"Laneto\", \"Perro Patero\", \"Perro Rizado\", \"Churro\", \"Barbeta\", and, most recently, \"Perro de Agua Espa\u00f1ol\" (literally Dog of Spanish Water, i.e., Spanish Water Dog).In Southern Spain (Andalusia), the SWD was often called the \"Andalusian Turk\" and some thought the breed came with Turkish sheep boats, but this is very unlikely since originally there were three separated populations of SWD in Spain with somewhat different phenotypes and sizes. One of these populations was found in Northern Spain, in Asturias and Cantabria, these dogs were usually smaller and of lighter colour, becoming a new breed 22 March 2011, the Cantabrian Water Dog. The other group could be found in the marshes of western Andalusia, this type of dogs had coats made of long and thin cords. And finally the largest group came from the southern Andalusian sierras, this type of dogs were the largest and strongest since were mainly used for herding. Today, the breed is well mixed and most SWD are well rounded and have a balanced of traits.Regardless of its exact origin, a woolly coated Shepherd Dog is documented to have been on the Iberian Peninsula by around 1100 CE. This is clearly a very ancient and rustic breed, very well adapted to the climate and terrain conditions found in the wetlands and coastal mountains of the Spanish shores.Historically, the SWDs were primarily used as Herding dogs to move the flocks of sheep and goats from one pasture to another. The dogs were also called upon to work wherever a dog was required.  For example, they were taught to work with fishermen as well as being taught to retrieve when hunting with the farmers.\n\n\n=== Revival of the breed ===\n\nIn about 1975, two enthusiasts, Antonio Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez and Santiago Montesinos, travelled around the countryside of Southern Spain, through the remote villages and farms of the mountainous region of Andalusia and bought or borrowed a number of dogs from the shepherds that they felt most fit the type they were looking for to establish a breeding program.In 1980, the Spanish Water Dog Club (Spain) was formed in order to promote the breed and help get it recognized in its own country.In 1985, after a lot of hard work and displaying the breed at various venues and dog shows the Spanish Kennel Club accepted it and gave it official status. It was provisionally recognized by F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale until 1999, when it was permanently recognized.The SWD was officially recognized in the United States by the United Kennel Club in 2001 and fully accepted for conformation events in 2004. Jerry and Ken Mann were instrumental in facilitating recognition in UKC. They presented the first SWD to be shown in an AKC Rare Breed Conformation venue in Inverness, Florida in January 2000. They presented an Introduction Seminar at a UKC venue in South Carolina in 2001 and showed the first SWD at a UKC Mult-Breed show in the Summer of 2004.  They spearheaded the first International SWD discussion list and were the first owners to use their SWD for herding in the United States. They brought the natural ability and historic value of herding to the fore. As of July 1, 2013, the Spanish Water Dog will move into the Herding Group in the UKC.The American Kennel Club Foundation Stock Service recognized the breed in 2005 through the efforts of the Spanish Water Dog Club, Inc. The AKC approved the breed to begin competition in AKC herding, in dog agility trials, obedience, and tracking beginning January 1, 2008. In June 2012, the SWD moved into the Miscellaneous Group. As of January 1, 2015, the Spanish Water Dog will join the Herding Group. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Spanish Water Dogs that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials. Additionally, the breed was recognized by the American Herding Breed Association in 2007.The Canadian Kennel Clubs Listed and Miscellaneous Breeds was amended to include the Spanish Water Dog as a listed breed effective as of 1 September 2008.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCristina D.

It was originally bred as a versatile gun dog. To this day, the breed is still a capable dog for that purpose. The Spinone is a loyal, friendly and alert dog with a close lying, wiry coat. It is an ancient breed that can be traced back to approximately 500 BC.It is traditionally used for hunting, pointing, and retrieving game (HPR), but, in addition to that purpose, the intelligent and strong Spinone may be practically anything ranging from a  companion to an assistance dog.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Spinone has a square build (the length of the body is approximately equal to the height at the withers). It is a strong-boned, solidly built dog with a well-muscled body and limbs that are suited to almost any kind of terrain. A brown and white Spinone can sometimes be confused with a German Wirehaired Pointer by someone unfamiliar with the breeds. However, the long head and pronounced occipital are unique to the breed. He has an expression that shows intelligence and understanding and is often described as having human-like eyes. The tail of the working Spinone is customarily docked at half its length (approx 5.5 to 8 inches or 140 to 200 mm from the base of the tail). Non-working UK based Italian Spinones are no longer docked, in accordance with current legislation. Even as adults, Spinoni retain disproportionate, puppy-like, webbed paws which make them powerful swimmers.\n\n\n==== Coat ====\n  \nThe coat is tough, slightly wiry, and close fitting. The preferred length is 1.5 to 2.5 in (3.8 to 6.4 cm) on the body; however, the ears, muzzle, head, and parts of  the legs and feet are covered with shorter hair. Eyebrows have longer and stiffer hair; longer but softer hair covers cheeks and muzzle, creating a profuse moustache and beard.\nThe Spinone should not have an undercoat. A long, soft or silky coat is undesired and is a sign of excessive grooming.\n\n\n==== Colour ====\nAcceptable variants (UK and US) are solid white, white with orange markings, orange roan with or without orange markings, white with brown markings, and brown roan with or without brown markings. Pigment of skin, nose, lips, and the pads on their feet should be a fleshy red-orange in white dogs, slightly darker in orange and brown roan dogs. The white and orange coloration is unique amongst the wire-haired gun dogs.\n.\n\n\n==== Height and weight ====\nHeight at withers: \t\n\nDogs: 60 to 70 cm (24 to 28 in).Weight should be in the correct proportion to size and structure:\n\nDogs: 34 to 39 kg (75 to 86 lb).\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Spinone is easy going, docile, and affectionate towards both people and dogs. It is well known for being loving and gentle with children. Its extremely patient nature also helps with this, but children should be taught not to take advantage of this trait. It is loyal to those it knows and still friendly to those it does not. The breed is not known for any aggression, but any dog breed can develop fear aggression if not properly socialized during the \"window of socialization\" from ages 6 weeks to 14 weeks.Centuries of working with man as a hunting companion has created a loyal, intelligent dog that is easily trained, although some can be stubborn about performing a learned task if they see no point in it. Because they are sensitive, motivational training works best for this breed, as this gentle dog's feelings can easily be hurt when handled incorrectly.The Spinone can be a very active breed, but it is not a racy dog like most other hunting breeds. The Spinone typically moves at the relaxed trot that is characteristic of the breed. It has often been called the perfect dog to run or jog with, because it will not run off in front and leave its human companion struggling to keep up as it prefers the slower pace itself. \nIt can be more than happy in a small yard and does not necessarily need acres of land. The small garden combined with regular walks would suit a Spinone well.\nIn part due to its long beard and lip folds, the Spinone can have a tendency to slobber.\n\n\n== Health ==\n \nLike all purebred dogs, it has its share of health problems, but careful breeding is helping the situation cease.\n\n\n=== Life expectancy ===\nIn 2004, The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom conducted a breed health survey [1] which found the average life expectancy of Italian Spinone to be 8.7 years.\n\n\n=== Known medical issues ===\nCerebellar ataxia: Cerebellar ataxia (CA) is a deadly hereditary condition that is known to affect Spinone puppies. It is a recessive gene; therefore, both sire and dam must have been carriers for any pup in a litter to have this condition. No puppy with CA has lived past the age of 12 months to date. Most puppies that have been diagnosed with the condition are euthanised at 10\u201311 months.  However, the AHT (UK) has developed a test for this condition.  Carriers can now be identified to a 95% certainty.\nHip dysplasia: Like some large breeds, the Spinone can suffer hip dysplasia. This is when the hip bones develop abnormally. Abnormal joint motion causes early onset arthritis  and makes it difficult and painful to do any exercise. Dogs diagnosed with severe hip dysplasia can have one of a number or surgical repairs including removal of the femoral head (FHO), surgical remodeling of the joint (triple pelvic osteotomy) or total hip replacement (implant of an artificial femoral head(ball) and acetabulum (socket)).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe breed is believed to have been developed in the Piedmont region of Italy. As the Spinone is a very ancient breed (it is believed to be one of the oldest gun dogs in existence), it is not known exactly what the origins of the breed are; there are many different theories. Some of these claim that the Spinone could have originated in  Italy, France, Spain, Russia, Greece, or Celtic Ireland.\nSome people familiar with the history of the breed claim that the Spinone descended from the  Spanish Pointer, whilst others claim that it was the ancient Russian Setter that is responsible for the breed we know today. An even more popular theory is that Greek traders brought coarse-haired setters to Italy during the height of the Roman empire, where the dogs were then crossed with various others and the modern Spinone eventually emerged.\nThe French claim that the Spinone has descended from crosses of several French pointing breeds, whilst the Italians believe the Spinone is the ancestor of the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon, the German Wirehaired Pointer, and the Pudelpointer. Any one of these claims could be true; perhaps several of them are correct.\nDuring the Second World War, the Spinone became close to extinct. Both the war and the fact that Italian hunters had begun using other breeds (such as setters, pointers, and spaniels) in the hunt, whereas before it was primarily the Spinone. Many breeders had to resort to crossing the Spinone with other wire-haired breeds, such as the Boulet, Wirehaired Pointing Griffon and German Wirehaired Pointer.\nThe breed was not officially known as \"Spinone\" until the early 19th century. Before then, some areas knew the breed as the \"Spinoso\". The breed may have been named after an Italian thorn bush, the spino, which was a favorite hiding place for small game because for larger animals it was practically impenetrable. Only thick-skinned, coarse-haired animals could fight through the branches unharmed to locate the game. The Spinone was the breed most capable of doing so, and, perhaps, therefore the name was formed.\nToday the Bracco Italiano is the most popular hunting dog in Italy, although the Spinone is still common. The Bracco is a racier, higher energy dog, while the Spinone excels at hunting close or in dense cover, and in retrieving from water.\nThe Duchess of Northumberland has a Spinone called Fuzzy.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBracco Italiano\nGriffon\nPointing breed\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n \nItalian Griffon breed description at the Italian federation (ENCI).\nThe American Kennel Club official site\nThe Italian Spinone Club of Great Britain\nThe Spinone Club of America\nItalian Spinone Sculpture\n/http://www.spinone-club.de - Der Deutsche Zuchtverein f\u00fcr Spinone Italiano\n\n\n=== Books ===\nLarkin, Peter & Stockman, Mike (2003).

The breed is named for Jocelyn Lucas.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nA short-legged working terrier that must be small and narrow enough in the chest to go to ground when required. About twelve inches at the withers, and about 15 lbs. in weight. The harsh shaggy coat is white with dark patches, or various combinations of brown, black and tan or grizzle and tan.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Sporting Lucas Terrier was developed in Scotland (firstly in Mey, Caithness and later in Abington, South Lanarkshire) from the Lucas Terrier, the Jack Russell Terrier, and various Fell Terriers by Brian Plummer in the 1990s, in an effort to create a good working terrier. In 1999 the Lucas Terrier Club de-listed all of Brian Plummer's dogs as they \"did not want infusions of other terrier types introduced into their bloodlines\". Breed clubs were then set up for Plummer's dog, and it became the Sporting Lucas Terrier, despite the fact that the connection to the original Lucas terrier is tenuous.\nThe Lucas Terrier was created by Major Jocelyn Lucas in the late 1940s, in an effort to breed a Sealyham Terrier that could go to ground, from Sealyhams and Norfolk Terriers. Today it has returned to being primarily a pet and showdog.Another breed of terrier developed by Brian Plummer is the Plummer Terrier. It is similar, but bull terrier was also used, and the dog developed a reputation for quarrelsomeness.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nOf the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world, only the United Kennel Club (US) recognises the Sporting Lucas Terrier, in their Terrier Group. It may also be recognised by any of the very large number of specialty dog clubs, dog sports clubs, minor registries, and internet based breed registry businesses.\nThe primary breed club for the Sporting Lucas Terrier, which was founded in 1999 after the split with the Lucas Terrier Club, is The Sporting Lucas Terrier Club.

They were originally bred for rescue by the hospice of the Great St Bernard Pass on the Italian-Swiss border. The hospice, built by and named after Italian monk Bernard of Menthon, acquired its first dogs between 1660 and 1670. The breed has become famous through tales of alpine rescues, as well as for its enormous size.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe St. Bernard is a giant dog. The average weight of the breed is between 65 and 120 kg (140 and 260 lb) or more, and the approximate height at the withers is 70 to 90 cm (28 to 35 in).The coat can be either smooth or rough; the smooth coat being close and flat while the rough is dense, flat, and more profuse around the neck and legs. The colour is typically a red shade with white, or a mahogany brindle with white. Black shading is usually found on the face and ears.\nThe tail is long and heavy, hanging low.\nEyes are usually brown, but sometimes can be icy blue, and should have naturally tight lids, with haws only slightly visible.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe ancestors of the St. Bernard share a history with the Sennenhunds. The St. Bernard, also called Alpine Mountain Dogs or Alpine Cattle Dogs, are the large farm dogs of the farmers and dairymen of most notably the French Alps, livestock guardians, herding dogs, and draft dogs as well as hunting dogs, search and rescue dogs, and watchdogs. These dogs are thought to be descendants of molosser type dogs brought into the Alps by the ancient Romans, and the St. Bernard is recognized internationally today as one of the Molossoid breeds.The earliest written records of the St. Bernard breed are from monks at the Great St Bernard Hospice at the Great St. Bernard Pass in 1707, with paintings and drawings of the dog dating even earlier. The first evidence that the dogs were in use at the monastery is in two paintings dating to 1690 by Italian artist Salvator Rosa. The most famous St. Bernard to save people at the pass was Barry (sometimes spelled Berry), who reportedly saved somewhere between 40 and 100 lives. There is a monument to Barry in the Cimeti\u00e8re des Chiens, and his body was preserved in the Natural History Museum in Berne.\nAnother famous dog was Rutor, the faithful companion of the Italian priest Pierre Chanoux, who was named after the peak T\u00eate du Rutor located above the Little St Bernard pass.\nThe classic St. Bernard looked very different from the St. Bernard of today because of cross-breeding.  Severe winters from 1816 to 1818 led to increased numbers of avalanches, killing many of the dogs used for breeding while they were performing rescues. In an attempt to preserve the breed, the remaining St. Bernards were crossed with Newfoundlands brought from the Colony of Newfoundland in the 1850s, and so lost much of their use as rescue dogs in the snowy climate of the alps because the long fur they inherited would freeze and weigh them down.The dogs never received any special training from the monks. Instead, younger dogs would learn how to perform search and rescue operations from older dogs.The Swiss St. Bernard Club was founded in Basel on 15 March 1884. The St. Bernard was the very first breed entered into the Swiss Stud Book in 1884, and the breed standard was finally approved in 1888. Since then, the breed has been a Swiss national dog.The dogs at the St Bernard hospice were working dogs that were smaller than today's show St Bernard's dogs. Originally about the size of a German Shepherd Dog, the St Bernard grew to the size of today's dog as kennel clubs and dog shows emphasized appearance over the dog's working ability, along with a closed stud book.An open stud book would have allowed breeders to correct such errors by breeding in Working dogs of other dog breeds.\n\n\n=== Naming ===\n\nThe name \"St. Bernard\" originates from the Great St. Bernard Hospice, a traveler's hospice on the often treacherous Great St. Bernard Pass in the Western Alps, between Switzerland and Italy. The pass, the lodge, and the dogs are named  for Bernard of Menthon, the 11th century Italian monk who established the station.\"St. Bernard\" was not in widespread use until the middle of the 19th century. The dogs were called \"Saint Dogs\", \"Noble Steeds\", \"Alpenmastiff\", or \"Barry Dogs\" before that time.\n\n\n=== Related breeds ===\nThe breed is strikingly similar to the English Mastiff, with which it shares a common ancestor known as the Alpine Mastiff. The modern St. Bernard breed is radically different than the original dogs kept at the St. Bernard hospice, most notably by being much larger in size and build. Since the late 1800s, the St. Bernard breed has been ever refined and improved using many different large Molosser breeds, including the Newfoundland, Great Pyrenees, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, Bernese Mountain Dog, Great Dane, English Mastiff, and possibly the Tibetan Mastiff and Caucasian Ovcharka. Other breeds such as the Rottweiler, Boxer, and English Bulldog may have contributed to the St. Bernard's bloodline as well. It is suspected that many of these large breeds were used to redevelop each other to combat the threat of their extinction after World War II, which may explain why all of them played a part in the creation of the St. Bernard as seen today.The four Sennenhund breeds, the Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund (Greater Swiss Mountain Dog), the Berner Sennenhund, (Bernese Mountain Dog), the Appenzeller Sennenhund, (Appenzeller), and the Entlebucher Sennenhund (Entlebucher Mountain Dog) are similar in appearance and share the same location and history, but are tricolor rather than red and white.\nThe Russian army kennels crossbreed St Bernards with Caucasian Ovcharka to produce the Moscow Watchdogs that are still used as military service dogs in Russia today. St Bernards have in common many characteristics of other Mountain dog breeds.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Kennel Club recognition ===\nThe St. Bernard is recognised internationally by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale as a Molosser in Group 2, Section 2. The breed is recognised by The Kennel Club (UK), the Canadian Kennel Club, and the American Kennel Club in the Working Dog breed group. The United Kennel Club in the United States places the breed in the Guardian Dog Group. The New Zealand Kennel Club and the Australian National Kennel Council place the breed in the Utility Group\n\n\n== Modern activities - Great St Bernard & Little St Bernard Pass ==\n\nSt. Bernard dogs are no longer used for Alpine rescues, the last recorded instance of which was in 1955. As late as 2004, the Great St Bernard Hospice still retained 18 of the dogs for reasons of tradition and sentiment. In that year the Barry Foundation created breeding kennels for the breed at the town of Martigny down the Great Saint Bernard Pass, and purchased the remaining dogs from the Hospice. During the summer months each year a number of the animals are temporarily relocated from Martigny to the Hospice for viewing by tourists.\nAn annual celebration of the breed takes place on the Little Saint Bernard Pass and at the town of Rosi\u00e8res-Montvalzan on the French side. Saint Bernard dog enthusiasts and breeders gather for a dog show and parades.The animals bred by the Foundation are trained to participate in a variety of dog sports including carting and weight pulling. The dogs at the Barry Foundation are reportedly smaller than the average St Bernard.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe very fast growth rate and the weight of a St. Bernard can lead to very serious deterioration of the bones if the dog does not get proper food and exercise. Many dogs are genetically affected by hip dysplasia or elbow dysplasia. Osteosarcoma (bone cancer) has been shown to be hereditary in the breed. They are susceptible to eye disorders called entropion and ectropion, in which the eyelid turns in or out. The breed standard indicates that this is a major fault. The breed is also susceptible to epilepsy and seizures, a heart disease called dilated cardiomyopathy, and eczema.\nUS and UK breed clubs put the average lifespan for a St. Bernard at 8\u201310 years. A 2003 Danish breed survey (35 dogs) puts the median lifespan at 9.5 years while a UK breed survey in 2004 (53 dogs) puts the median lifespan at 7 years. In the UK survey about one in five lived to >10 years with the longest lived dog at 12 years and 9 months.A study of genetically related polyneuropathy in the breed was conducted.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nKnown as a classic example of a Gentle Giant, the Saint Bernard is calm, patient and sweet with adults, and especially children. However St. Bernards, like all very large dogs, must be well socialized with people and other dogs in order to prevent fearfulness and any possible aggression or territoriality. The biggest threat to small children is being knocked over by this breed's larger size. Overall they are a sweet, gentle, calm, loyal and affectionate breed, and if socialized are very friendly. Because of its large adult size, it is essential that proper training and socialization begin while the St. Bernard is still a puppy, so as to avoid the difficulties that normally accompany training large dogs. An unruly St. Bernard may present problems for even a strong adult, so control needs to be asserted from the beginning of the dog's training. While generally not instinctively protective, a St. Bernard may bark at strangers, and their size makes them good deterrents against possible intruders.The Saint Bernard was bred to be a working companion and to this day the St. Bernard lives to please its master and is an amiable yet hard worker. St. Bernards have retained their natural ability for scent work and depending on the skill of the trainer and the talents of the dog, St. Bernards can participate in tracking events or even become involved in search and rescue work.\n\n\n== Notability ==\n\n\n=== Record size ===\n\nSt. Bernards were exported to England in the mid-19th century, where they were bred with mastiffs to create an even larger dog. Plinlimmon, a famous St. Bernard of the time, was measured at 95 kg (210 lbs) and 87.5 cm (34\u200b1\u20442ins), and was sold to an American for $7000. Commercial pressure encouraged breeding ever larger dogs until \"the dogs became so gross that they had difficulties in getting from one end of a show ring to another\".An 1895 New York Times report mentions a St. Bernard named Major F. measuring 8 feet 6 inches (2.59 m) in length, who, if the claims are true, would be the longest dog in history. Another St. Bernard named Benedictine V Schwarzwald Hof (Pierson, Michigan - USA) also reached 315 lb (143 kg), which earned a place in the 1981 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\n\n=== In media ===\n\nSt. Bernards are often portrayed, especially in old live action comedies such as Swiss Miss, the TV series Topper, and classic cartoons, wearing small barrels of brandy around their necks. Avalanche victims supposedly drank the brandy to stay warm while awaiting rescue, although this is medically unsound. The monks of the St. Bernard Hospice deny that any St. Bernard has ever carried casks or small barrels around their necks; they attribute the image to an 1820 painting by Edwin Landseer, perhaps Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveler (which became a popular engraving in 1831 by Charles Landseer). The monks did keep casks around for photographs by tourists.There was apparently at least one dog that really did carry brandy. In The Percy Anecdotes, by Thomas Byerley, published in 1823, the following anecdote appears, and was often quoted in other books in the 19th century:\n\nThe breed of dogs kept by the monks to assist them ... has been long celebrated for its sagacity and fidelity. All the oldest and most tried of them were lately buried, along with some unfortunate travellers, under a valanche [sic]; but three or four hopeful puppies were left at home in the convent, and still survive. The most celebrated of those who are no more, was a dog called Barry. This animal served the hospital for the space of twelve years, during which time he saved the lives of forty individuals. His zeal was indefatigable. Whenever the mountain was enveloped in fogs and snow, he set out in search of lost travellers. He was accustomed to run barking until he lost breath, and would frequently venture on the most perilous places. When he found his strength was insufficient to draw from the snow a traveller benumbed with cold, he would run back to the hospital in search of the monks\u2026.\nWhen old age deprived him of strength, the Prior of the Convent pensioned him at Berney, by way of reward. After his death, his hide was stuffed and deposited in the museum of that town. The little phial, in which he carried a reviving liquor for the distressed travellers whom he found among the mountains, is still suspended from his neck.\nA Punch magazine cartoon from 1949 depicts a man with a St. Bernard and several puppies, all of which are wearing neck casks. The man explains, \"Of course, I only breed them for the brandy.\"\nA frequent joke in old MGM and Warner Brothers shorts is to depict the dogs as compulsive alcoholics who engage in frequent nips from their own casks.\n\n\n=== Famous St. Bernards ===\n\nBachelor, Resident Dog, The Ritz-Carlton, Bachelor Gulch\nBurtonswood (Bossy Boots).

It is from Friesland and in particular from the Frisian forest area, a region in the southeast and east of Friesland. The breed has been mentioned in Dutch literature going back to the early 1800s, but has only extended its range from the 1960s outside of Friesland and not until the 2000s did the range officially extend beyond the Netherlands. The name Stabij translates roughly as \"stand by me\" with the last part simply Frisian, meaning dog, which is pronounced \"hoon\". The dog is considered a Dutch national treasure. There are only a few thousand Stabyhouns in existence today worldwide.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nThe Stabyhoun is found in historic literature from Joost Halbertsma, Waling Dijkstra and Nynke fan Hichtum dating back to the early 1800s. In earlier days it was used for hunting foxes, small game, and birds.  While on farms, Stabyhouns exhibited fine skills as a mole-catcher. During the hunting season, it was used as an all-round gundog.  Today, the Stabyhoun remains a competent hunter, although British and German breeds are more popular. Renowned for its peaceful disposition, the Stabij is a soft-mouthed retriever, a fine pointer, excellent tracker, and a good watchdog. It has also been used by dairy farmers as a dog-carts.\nHistorically, these dogs were nearly exclusively owned by farmers, whose limited financial means dictated the need for a single farm dog capable as an all-around working, hunting, guard and gentle house breed.\n\nThe breed's appearance and purpose have not changed. In order to optimize the working traits of the working farm dog in earlier days the Stabyhoun was often mixed with another old and rare Friesian breed, the Wetterhoun. However, in 1942 Stabij owners organized for official breed recognition and crossbreeding between the Stabyhoun and Wetterhoun was halted in an effort to prevent the extinction of the increasingly rare breeds.\nToday the Stabyhoun enjoys a small but thoroughly devoted following among Dutch sportsmen and homeowners. Its numbers are increasing slowly but steadily. This breed has caught the attention of dog lovers in the United Kingdom, Scandinavia and North America.\n\n\n=== The working Stabyhoun ===\nHistorically, the Stabyhoun was an all-around working dog for a farmer that might be only able to afford and support a single dog that was required to be an all-around able worker that shared the home. Apart from hunting, these dogs were used to guard property and to catch rats, moles, and bunzing. This versatility is still reflected in the breed today. It is also this lack of a working specialization, the Stabij's generalization an all-rounder but not an expert at any particular skill that caused the breed to not be as sought-after traditionally.\nThe Stabyhoun is both a soft-mouthed retriever and a pointer with a strong tracking nose. It works very well on water, enduring the coldest rivers and lakes, and is easily controlled over greater distances. It brings in any game alive and undamaged. Although of medium build and size, it is a powerful and sturdy dog, and larger Stabyhouns of the past were occasionally used as draught animals to pull dog-carts .\nThe Stabyhoun is now used in almost all types of dog trials and activities: dog agility, obedience, hunting, triathlon, endurance, frisbee, and others.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Stabyhoun has a gentle disposition. This breed is friendly, sensitive, intelligent, peaceful, patient, and willing to please, but may be stubborn on occasion. The Stabyhoun exhibits great tolerance of children and other animals. With steady yet gentle training, this breed will be obedient and devoted to its owner.  Stabyhouns should never be vicious or snappy.\nAlthough a Stabyhoun can be very calm indoors, like all sporting breeds it enjoys plenty of physical activity. Stabyhouns like to swim.\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nSturdily built with a soft silky coat, the Stabyhoun is greater in length than height.  It should be of good physical scale and balance and neither muscular nor slender in build. Feminine and masculine differences in facial features are distinct and easily distinguished between the sexes.\n\n\n==== Coat ====\nMost Stabyhouns have a black and white colored coat with often a solid fully colored, usually black, head and white tipped tail. Brown and white Stabyhouns are less common, but may be seen in the Netherlands, while the orange and white coated Stabyhouns are becoming increasingly rare.\n\nSpotting and/or roan in the white are acceptable, but tricolor is considered a fault. Males are 53 cm (21 in) and females are 50 cm (20 in), measured at the withers. The ideal weight of a Stabyhoun is 45 lb (20 kg) for a female and 50\u201355 lb (23\u201325 kg) for a male.\n\n\n==== Head ====\nThe head should show more length than width, with the skull and foreface equally long. The hair on the head is short. The skull should be slightly domed, but not narrow, and may never give the impression of being wide.  The head is carried low on a strong, slightly arched neck. The stop is only slightly indicated. The foreface is powerful, tapering gently toward the nose without giving the appearance of a point. The bridge is straight and the muzzle is broad with a nose that is well developed and has wide nostrils. Lips are tight and cover the teeth, which are strong and have a scissor bite. The neck should be free of throatiness or dewlap. The expression of the face should always be gentle and intelligent.\nThe ears are set fairly low, medium in size, and are strongly developed.  The ears project from the head, and are moderately long and shaped like a mason's trowel. Feathering on the ears is typical, with hair growing longer at the base of the ear and steadily decreasing in length. The bottom-most third of the ear is covered with short hair.\nThe eyes should lie level in the head, and be of medium size with tight rounded lids.  There should not be the appearance of haw or a third eyelid. Dogs with black and white coats should have dark brown eyes, while brown and white Stabyhouns may have brown- or orange-colored eyes.  Bird of prey eyes are considered to be a fault.\n\n\n==== Body ====\nThe Stabyhoun's coat is long and sleek.  Although a slight wave over the croup is permissible, it should never be curly. The hair behind a Stabyhoun's front and rear quarters is longer and fuller, but should never feather. Any curling of the coat suggests that cross-breeding has occurred in a dog's line, and for this reason cannot be considered a purebred Stabyhoun.\nA Stabyhoun's body should be powerful with well-rounded ribs. Its back is straight with the croup sloping slightly. The loin is powerful, and the belly is only moderately tucked up. \nThe tail is long, reaching to the hock. It is set low and carried downwards with a gentle bend upwards toward the tip of the tail. In action, the tail is lifted, but never so as to curl.  Like the hair behind a Stabyhoun's front and rear quarters, the tail hair should be long, full, and bushy.  However, the tail hair should not feather.\nThe shoulder is well laid against the chest, the blades well laid back and angulated. The lower forequarters should be powerful and straight, likewise the forelegs straight. A Stabyhoun's pasterns should be strong. The hindquarters are powerful and well angulated with a low placed hock. The feet should be round and rather big, with toes that are well developed and arched. A Stabyhoun should have thick pads.\n\n\n== Health ==\nA relatively healthy breed with no current common health issues, the average life span of a Stabyhoun is 12\u201314 years. Diet, exercise, care and environment are currently the factors of greatest overall influence on the breed's health and lifespan.The Stabyhoun is an overall a healthy dog. Known congenital health conditions in the breed are Patent Ductus Arteriosis (PDA), Epilepsy, Elbow Dysplasia, Hip Dysplasia and Type 1 von Willebrands Disease (vWB). Other conditions recorded are Radius Curvus, Hereditary Cataracts, Steroid Responsive Meningitis-Arteritis (SRMA) and non-specific Cancer. The heritability of these conditions is uncertain, on, but with careful breeding, most of these problems were eliminated. Epilepsy occurred in the past, but is no longer a common genetic inheritance.\n\n\n=== Care ===\nThe Stabyhoun does not require special care apart from regular brushing to minimize tangling. The dogs moult (shed) twice a year, and thorough brushing helps the process of shedding. Without brushing, Stabyhoun hair can get tangled and matted in the manner of dreadlocks.  The hair behind the ears is particularly susceptible to tangling and matting. Washing with soap should be avoided when possible because soap strips the coat of its natural oils and shine. The Stabyhoun coat will naturally rid itself of dirt and mud. After a swim the dog is usually clean and dry in a matter of hours.\n\n\n=== Breeding ===\nDue to the limited size of the Stabyhoun population, careful breeding is essential. The Dutch Association for Stabyhouns and Wetterhouns (Nederlandse Vereniging voor Stabij- en Wetterhounen/NVSW), the Ameri-Can Stabyhoun Association and the UK Stabyhoun Association has breed advisors who assist with mating selections. In an effort to control inbreeding, the association keeps breeding at a minimum and carefully considers prospective matings. Despite there being small populations of Stabyhouns outside of the Netherlands, the breeding population is small and the greatest genetic diversity remains in the Netherlands. Since Stabyhouns are viewed as part of the Dutch national heritage, breeders keep puppy and dog prices affordable; Stabyhoun breeders are commonly hobby breeders as a result. The average Stabyhoun litter size is seven. Bitches are limited to delivering no more than 5 litters in their lifetime.\nThe bitch may only reproduce when she reaches a minimum age of 18 months, and cannot breed once she reaches the age of 9. At least one year should elapse between litters. The hips of prospective mating pair have to be x-rayed (not over FCI-C result), and the match between bitch and stud has to be approved by the Dutch Club's breeding committee. A stud must be 18 months of age or older to breed, and it must have with the same show and hip results as its female mate. Stud dogs should not sire more than three litters a year, and 10 in their lifetime. Stud-owners are expected to appear on breeders' days so that the dogs may be evaluated and paired with potentially suitable mates.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUK Stabyhoun Association (United Kingdom)\nNederlandse Vereniging voor staby-en wetterhounen (Dutch association for staby-and wetterhounen).

At the cattle market, dogs were set upon bulls, bears, or other large animals, with the intent of tenderizing the meat but more commonly to provide entertainment for the crowd.\nAnother blood sport dogs were involved in during this time was dog fighting. Dog fighting involved gambling on dogs that were released into a pit in hopes of betting on the recognized winner: the last surviving dog. This breed has been bred for purposes of fighting and aggression. A dog fighting contest was cheaper to organize and easier to conceal from the law than bull baiting or bear baiting.These blood sports were officially eliminated in 1835 as Britain began to introduce animal welfare laws.The early bull and terrier dogs were developed as a result of breeding for the characteristic known as gameness. Gameness was a desirable trait during a time when pitting dogs against bear or bull was common. Gameness ultimately tests the strength and skill of the dogs. Land-race working dogs crossbred with the early bull and terrier types with this gameness trait provided the ancestral foundation stock for the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.\n\n\n== Acceptance ==\nThe Staffordshire Bull Terrier name was officially accepted by The Kennel Club on May 25, 1935. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club was formed in June 1935, after the acceptance of the breed by The Kennel Club. It is unusual for a breed to be recognized without first having a club in existence or a breed standard in place. A standard was not drawn up until June 1935 at the Old Cross Guns, a Black Country pub in Cradley Heath where 30 Stafford enthusiasts gathered. It was there that the group also elected the club's first secretary, Joseph Dunn, a well-known figure connected with the breed. Challenge certificates were awarded to the breed in 1938, and the first champions were Joseph Dunn's Ch. Gentleman Jim and Ch. Lady Eve taking titles in 1939.Staffordshire Bull Terriers have been the traditional mascot of the army regiments in Staffordshire since 1882. C/Sgt Watchman V is the current serving mascot. The breed was recognised in the United States by the American Kennel Club in 1975.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a medium-sized, stocky, and very muscular dog, with a similar appearance to the much larger American Staffordshire Terrier and American Pit Bull Terrier. The coat is smooth and clings tightly to the dog's body, making movement through air and water much easier for the breed. This dog has a broad, wedge-shaped head (male considerably more so than female), defined occipital muscles, a relatively short fore-face, dark round eyes and a wide mouth with a clean scissor-like bite (the top incisors slightly overlap the bottom incisors).The breed has small ears, pronounced cheek muscles, and tight jowls. The breed's waist is tucked up into their loins and the last 1\u20132 ribs of the rib-cage are usually visible. The tail is often straight and thin, with a slight curve at the end.\nThe hind quarters are well-muscled. The breed is naturally muscular and may appear intimidating.\nStaffordshires come in a variety of colours: brindle, fawn, red, blue, black, and  white. Blending of these colours with white and with any other colour broken up over the body is known as \"pied\".It is advised not to breed from Staffordshires with light eyes or Merle which is a result of a genetic mutation and can cause health issues such as blindness and loss of hearing.The dogs stand 36 to 41 cm (14 to 16 in) at the withers (ridge between the shoulder blades) and weigh 13 to 17 kg (29 to 37 lb) for males; females are 11 to 15.4 kg (24 to 34 lb).\n\n\n=== Health ===\nStaffordshire Bull Terriers may be at risk for these health problems:\n\nHereditary cataracts\nL-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria \u2014 a metabolic disorder resulting in dementia-like symptoms. These symptoms are detectable by DNA tests.\nDistichiasis (commonly known as \u201cdouble eyelash\u201d)\nPersistent hyperplastic primary vitreous \u2014 a condition the blood supply to the ocular lens fails to regress and fibrovascular tissue forms, causing hazy vision. This health concern can be checked with an ocular examination throughout the life of the breed to prevent the transfer and spread of these conditions.The breed is known to be at a higher risk from mastocytoma (mast cell tumors) than the general population of dogs.A UK Kennel Club survey determined the median lifespan of the breed to be 12.75 years. UK vet clinic data determined the median to be 10.7 years.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe modern breed is one that has a temperament suitable as a companion dog but due to its breeding and history, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier is known for its character of fearlessness and toughness. However, this breed is also known to have an affectionate nature and is naturally loyal; they are also a friendly and lively breed. The breed is known to be quick learning and Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppies are considered easy to house train.\nStaffordshires are notably adaptable in terms of changing home or even owners but this can cause issues as it makes them vulnerable to dog napping.\n\n\n=== Aggression ===\nWith proper socialization of the breed from a young age, Staffordshires can be friendly to both other dogs and humans. Staffordshires are known to fight if challenged. When encountering unknown dogs, the Staffordshire could become aggressive if challenged by the unacquainted dog. This breed is also known to be headstrong and stubborn which contributes to the occurrence of challenge-related aggression. However, with dutiful obedience training by a confident owner, can alleviate this aggression.RSPCA chief vet Mark Evans said \"Our experience suggests that problems occur when bad owners exploit the Staffie's desire to please by training them to show aggression.\"\n\n\n== Cooper ==\nIn March 2018, Staffordshire Police took Cooper, a two-year-old Staffordshire Bull Terrier, from an RSPCA animal center in Taunton for training. He is the first police dog of this breed in the UK..\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Breed-Specific Legislation ==\n\nStaffordshire Bull Terriers are the subject of debate as to whether or not they may be added to the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991.Breed-specific legislation includes breed-specific restrictions and requirements:\n\nRequired public muzzling\nCarrying liability insurance\nRequired \"dangerous dog sign\" on dog's residence\nMandatory microchipping\nMandatory spay and neuter\nRequired \"dangerous dog\" tags\n\n\n=== Irish Staffordshire ===\nThe purported Irish variety of Staffordshire Bull Terrier, also referred to as Irish Bull Terrier, is not recognized by any notable kennel club or breed registry. Some suspect the dogs are American Pit Bull Terriers with an Irish nomenclature to circumvent breed-specific legislation bans, such as the United Kingdom's Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. A statement by the RSPCA raised concern that \"the 'Irish' variety \u2013 which it does not recognise as a breed\" contributed to a rise in incidents of dog fighting at a level equivalent to that of the 1980s. A 2002 article published in The Telegraph, quoted Beverley Cuddy, then editor of Dogs Today, who called the Irish bull terrier a complete fiction, stating \"There is no recognised Irish Staffordshire bull terrier breed.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nAmerican Staffordshire Terrier\nAmerican Pit Bull Terrier\nBlue Paul Terrier\nJock of the Bushveld\u2014a popular South African true story featuring a Staffordshire Bull Terrier cross\nRat-baiting\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStaffordshire Bull Terrier at Curlie"}, {"id": 464, "name": "Standard Schnauzer", "country": "Germany", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog464", "description": "The Standard Schnauzer (Mittelschnauzer) is a dog breed that originated in Germany from at least 14th-15th century, of Schnauzer breed type and progenitor of the Giant Schnauzer and Miniature Schnauzer. Initially it was called Wire-Haired Pinscher, while Schnauzer was adopted in 1879. The literal translation is \"snouter\" from the German word for \"snout\" and means colloquially \"moustache\", or \"whiskered snout\", because of the dog's distinctively bearded snout.Generally classified as a working or utility dog, this versatile breed is robust, squarely built, medium-sized dog with aristocratic bearing. It has been claimed that it was a popular subject of painters Sir Joshua Reynolds, Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Rembrandt, but actual proof remains elusive. Standard Schnauzers are either salt-and-pepper or black in color, and are known for exhibiting many of the \"ideal\" traits of any breed. These include high intelligence, agility, alertness, reliability, strength, and endurance. This breed of dog has been very popular in Europe, specifically Germany, where it originated. The breed was first exhibited at a show in Hanover in 1879, and since then has taken top honors in many shows, including the prestigious \"Best in Show\" at Westminster Kennel Club\" in the United States in 1997.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Schnauzer-type dogs of medium size were developed as a versatile multifunctional breed from herding and working breeds in Germany (W\u00fcrttemberg and Bavaria). It is claimed that it appears in German artwork from 14th-16th centuries; in a 14th century statue in Mecklenburg which shows a hunter with the dog at his feet, that if was painted by Albrecht D\u00fcrer (Madonna of the Animals) and Rembrandt in several village scenes, Lucas Cranach the Elder in his tapestry from 1501 depicting Christ's crowning with thorns, shown in 1620 statue The Night Watchman located in Stuttgart (probably meant 19th century statue Nachtw\u00e4chterbrunnen by de:Adolf Fremd), and since early 18th century even in English artwork, but actual proof remains elusive.Historians and cynologists theorize that it has a common ancestry with German Pinscher as a rough-coated variant of the Pinscher breed, and that it was possibly crossed with black German Poodle and gray Wolf Spitz to which influence is attributed black soft coat and salt-and-pepper wiry coat, and perhaps also Bolognese dog. Such a variety would have been more useful in winter, and livestock-driving and vermin-hunting roles.A dog of the peasant farmers for centuries, with the advent of dog showing in the 19th century they finally captured the interest of German dog fanciers, who began to standardize their look and temperament for the show ring. By 1850 was recognized as a distinct purebred dog. Those early dogs had many recognizable features, such as thick facial hair, wiry double coat, elegant necks, and cropped tails. The breed takes its name from one of their kind, a medium-sized show dog named \"Schnauzer\", who won at the 1879 Hanover Show in Germany. Since the 1900s the breed universally started to be called as Schnauzer. It is considered that the word itself appeared for the first time in 1842 when Jeremias Gotthelf used it as a synonym for the Wire-Haired Pinscher, which was also known as Wire-Haired German Pinscher, Rauhaar Pinscher (Rough-Haired Terrier), Rattenfanger, Ratter. By the name \"Wire-Haired German Pinscher\" it received first German breed standard in 1880 (or 1884), and initially having a wide variety of coat colors, between 1885-1890 were introduced black and pepper-and-salt color variations which would become dominant colors in 1907 breed standard. In this period has developed a standard with more elegant head, more prominent beard, and eyebrows, as well as overall appearance. The Pinscher-Schnauzer Club was founded in 1895 and is still active.Although it is claimed that the first Standard Schnauzer in the United States was shown in the Miscellaneous Class at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York City in 1899, and European immigrants could have brought it with them, the first official import was recorded in 1905, named Fingal. However, it became more popular only after World War I, where the Germany army used it to carry small packages while the Red Cross for guard duty and other aides. The Wire-Haired Pinscher Club of America was founded in 1925. The club was for both Standard and Miniature Schnauzers, but since 1933 the club was divided for separate promotion, one of them being Standard Schnauzer Club of America. Initially, American Kennel Club (AKC) classified it in the Working Group, but in 1926 were moved to Terrier Group, which was reverted in 1945 or 1946. It was imported into England circa 1926, within two years, was formed Schnauzer Club of Great Britain, and in the late 1930s received challenge certificates. CKC also includes it in the Working Group, UKC includes it in Guardian Group, the KC, ANKC and NZKC include it in the Utility Group, while by the VDH and FCI Schnauzer is placed in \"Group 2, Section 1: Pinschers and Schnauzers\", with \"Nr. 182\" in \"Section 1.2\" dedicated to the Standard Schnauzer breed.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nDistinguished by their long beards and eyebrows, Standard Schnauzers are always pepper and salt or less commonly black in color, with a stiff and wiry hair coat on the body similar to that of other wirehaired breeds. Their hair will perpetually grow in length without properly shedding, but contrary to popular belief Standard Schnauzers are not hypo-allergenic and they all shed to some degree. The more wiry \u2013 and correct and weather-resistant \u2013 the coat, the more that the coat will shed, though the hair dropped from a single dog is said to be nearly unnoticeable.\n\n\n== Care ==\n\n\n=== Grooming ===\n\nTwice a year, when most other breeds of dog are shedding their coat, a Schnauzer\u2019s coat will become dull and relatively easy to pull out and is said to have \u2018blown\u2019. At this point, the coat can be stripped or pulled out by hand and a new wire coat will re-grow in its place.  Stripping is not painful for the dog and can be performed at any stage of hair growth although it is easier to do when the coat is \u2018blown\u2019.\nAlternatively, the coat can be regularly clipped with shears.  Clipping as opposed to stripping results in a loss of the wiry texture and some of the fullness of the coat. Dogs with clipped fur no longer \u2018blow\u2019 their coat but the coat loses its wiry texture and becomes soft.  The fur of clipped dogs tends to be more prone to tangling and knots, particularly when long, and is duller in color than that of stripped coats. In the case of the salt and pepper Schnauzers, the characteristic banded color of the hair is completely lost when maintained through clipping; each shaft of hair becomes entirely gray rather than being banded with multiple shades of gray, white, and black. \nClipping is most common in the U.S. as it can be difficult to locate a professional willing to hand strip (the process is quite labor-intensive). In Europe, it is very uncommon to see a wire-coated dog which is clipped. It may not be possible to hand strip a poor quality coat, i.e. one that is soft in texture, but soft coats (while relatively common in pet-quality Miniature Schnauzers), are not a widespread problem in Standards.\nRegardless of whether the body of the coat is stripped or clipped, the 'furnishings' or longer hair on the legs and face must be scissored or clipped regularly and require daily brushing to remain free of potentially painful mats. Whether a Schnauzer is stripped or clipped, his coat requires a great deal of grooming. In most cases, this means an owner must either take care to learn the required grooming - for which the dog's breeder should be a great resource - or the owner must take their dog in for regular, often expensive, trips to a grooming salon.\n\n\n=== Docking and cropping ===\n\nInside the U.S. and Canada, ears and tail and dewclaws are in some areas docked as a puppy. Veterinarians or experienced breeders will cut tails and dewclaws between 3 and 7 days of age. Tails are traditionally docked to around three vertebrae. Ear cropping is usually performed at about 10 weeks of age in a veterinary clinic. Many breeders inside North America have begun to crop only those puppies retained for show purposes, or those puppies whose owners request it. There is still somewhat of a bias against natural ears in the North American show ring. However, there is a growing sentiment among breeders and judges that both ear types are equally show-worthy, and many North American show breeders enjoy both cropped and natural eared dogs in their kennels. However, unlike in Europe, the majority of North American breeders believe that the choice of whether to cut ears and/or tails should continue to remain with the breeders and owners. Docking of any dog is now illegal in several Canadian provinces, led by Quebec. Outside of North America, most Standard Schnauzers retain both their natural ears and tail as docking is now prohibited by law in many countries.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe smallest of the working breeds, the Standard Schnauzer makes a loyal family dog with guardian instincts. Most will protect their home from uninvited visitors with a deep and robust bark. Originally a German farmdog, they adapt well to any climatic condition, including cold winters. In general, they typically are good with children and were once known in Germany as \"kinderwachters\". If properly trained and socialized early to different ages and temperaments of people, they can be very patient and tolerant in any situation. Like other working dogs, Standard Schnauzers require a fairly strong-willed owner that can be consistent and firm with training and commands.\nStandard Schnauzers are also widely known to be intelligent and easy to train. They have been called \"the dog with a human brain\", and in Stanley Coren's book The Intelligence of Dogs, they are ranked 18th out of 140 breeds within 79 ranks on the ability to learn and obey known commands. Standard Schnauzers are extremely versatile, excelling at dog sports such as agility, obedience, tracking, disc dog, flyball and herding. Members of the breed have been used in the last 30 years in the United States as for bomb detection, search and rescue, and skin and lung cancer detection.\nLike most working dogs, Standard Schnauzers will be rambunctious until about the age of two; and lots of exercise will keep them busy. Owners must be prepared to mentally and physically stimulate their Schnauzer every day, even into their old age. Like other high-intelligence breeds, a bored Schnauzer is a destructive Schnauzer.\nAccording to the Standard Schnauzer Club of America, \u201cThe Standard Schnauzer is considered a high-energy dog. They need ample exercise not only for physical well-being but also for emotional well-being. The minimum amount an adult dog should get is the equivalent of one long walk a day. This walk should be brisk enough to keep the dog at a steady trotting pace in order to keep the dog in prime physical condition. The Standard Schnauzer puppy is constantly exploring, learning and testing his limits. As adults, they are always ready for a walk in the woods, a ride in the car, a training session or any other activity that allows them to be with their owner. This is a breed that knows how to be on the alert, even when relaxing by the feet of their owner.\n\n\n== Health ==\n   \nOverall, the Standard Schnauzer is a very healthy breed. The 2008 health survey done by the Standard Schnauzer Club of America revealed that roughly only 1% of dogs surveyed had serious health issues. The final, full report can be found here; a general summary is as follows:\n\nData was collected for 10-15% of eligible dogs;\nMedian life span was 12.9 years\nOnly a few serious diseases were noted;\nPotentially serious conditions affect less than 1% of dogs\nApparent progress has been made in reducing the incidence of hip dysplasia\nThe two major hereditary within the breed are: hip dysplasia and hereditary eye disease. Both problems can be tested for and identified in breeding stock before they pass the trait onto the next generation, so the Standard Schnauzer Club of America recommends that every kennel test their breeding stock for hip and eye problems before breeding and to breed only healthy animals. \nHowever, it is entirely up to breeders whether they choose to health test their animals and whether they choose to use animals for breeding despite knowing they have tested positive for carrying a genetic disease. The SSCA also encourages all potential buyers to ask their breeder for up to date OFA and CERF certifications of the parent dogs before buying a puppy.\nThe Orthopedic Foundation for Animals found at www.offa.org keeps a record of purebred animals that have passed an x-ray screening for hip dysplasia. Dogs must be a minimum of two years old to be OFA tested. The OFA results reported in the 2008 SSCA Health Survey are as follows:\n\nThe cost of OFA testing is relatively high (about 150-200 USD per dog per year) and borne directly by breeders. OFA testing is not required for AKC registration of breeding stock or their offspring so the benefits of good OFA test scores are more indirect and long range for individual breeders while poor results represent a direct negative impact. Responsible buyers looking to buy from responsible breeders should only choose puppies from a litter where both parents have current OFA test certificates and scores of \"excellent\", \"good\", \"fair\".\nThe Canine Eye Registration Foundation is a registry for purebred breeding stock who have been certified free of any hereditary eye disease: results for this test can also be found at the OFA website. Dogs must be examined by an approved veterinarian who checks for the presence of heritable eye diseases. Testing is less inexpensive (about 20-40 USD) than OFA examinations but, like OFA testing, must be done annually to remain valid.\n\n\n== Famous Schnauzers ==\nGeorge, the cancer-sniffing dog, has received much acclaim. \"\nBlu, Franklin's pet blue dog in the comic Monica's Gang\nColin, in the U.K. comedy series Spaced, became a regular feature in the middle of the first series.\nShunaemon, from the manga and TV series Fortune Dogs\nJunkers, a talking schnauzer from the anime film Junkers Come Here\nAsta, the dog belonging to Nick and Nora Charles in the Dashiell Hammett detective novel The Thin Man, was a female Schnauzer (presumably a Standard, based on the size that she is indicated to be). In the subsequent film series based on the novel, she was instead depicted as a male Fox Terrier.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDutch Smoushond\n\n\n== References ==\n\nFogle, Bruce, DVM (2000).

Stephens' Stock Cur), is a scent hound that belongs to the Cur dog breed. They were originally bred by the Stephens family in southeastern Kentucky. The dogs known as \"Little black dog\" were bred by generations of that family for over a century. In 1970, they were recognized as separate and distinct breed of Cur. The dog is mostly black with white markings, but more than a third white is not permissible. It is good for hunting raccoon and squirrel, but can also be used to bay wild boar. The breed is registered with the United Kennel Club.\n\n\n== History ==\nHundreds of years ago, the term \"cur\" referred to dogs of mixed ancestry, but it came to be used for a working type of dog in the Southern United States. The dogs that came to be known as Mountain Curs were used by early settlers for hunting and as guard dogs in Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky.By the 1940s, the Mountain Cur was close to extinction. Four breeders started programs to save the breed: Hugh Stephens of Kentucky, Carl McConnel of Virginia, Woody Huntsman of Kentucky and Dewey Ledbetter of Tennessee. They founded the Mountain Cur Club, later renamed the Original Mountain Cur Breeders Association (OMCBA), and continued the breeding of Mountain Cur strains. The Treeing Cur and the Mountain View Cur were developed from these strains.The Stephens' Stock Mountain Cur was identified in 1970 by its namesake Hugh Stephens who believed it was different enough from the original strains of Mountain Cur, and so the Stephen's Breeders Association (SBA) was formed. Starting 1 November 1998, the breed is now recognized by the United Kennel Club.\n\n\n== Description ==\nA Stephens Cur is usually dark grey or black with white markings on the chest, neck and feet. The breed has a dome-shaped head with a short muzzle and brown- or dark-colored eyes. They have a deep broad chest, medium length neck and have either a smooth or rough coat.They are a medium-sized dog, with Mountain Cur and Black Mouth Cur being larger varieties of Cur type dogs, the Stephens' Breeders Association standard requires the dogs to be between 16\u201323 inches (41\u201358 cm) in height and no more than 55 pounds (25 kg).\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 466, "name": "Styrian Coarse-haired Hound", "country": "Austria", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog466", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 467, "name": "Sussex Spaniel", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog467", "description": "The Sussex Spaniel is a breed of dog developed in Sussex in southern England. It is a low, compact spaniel and is similar in appearance to the Clumber Spaniel. They can be slow-paced, but can have a clownish and energetic temperament. They suffer from health conditions common to spaniels and some large dogs, as well as a specific range of heart conditions and spinal disc herniation.\nFirst bred in 1795 in Brightling, East Sussex for specific hunting conditions, they nearly became extinct during the Second World War. They are now more popular in the United States than any other country and are recognised by all major kennel clubs. Notably, a Sussex Spaniel won the best in show in 2009 at the 133rd Westminster Kennel Club.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Sussex Spaniel is a low compact spaniel similar in appearance to a small, dark Clumber Spaniel. It is normally no taller than 13\u201315 in (33\u201338 cm) at the withers and the usual weight range is 35\u201345 lb (16\u201320 kg) with a roughly rectangular appearance. The Clumber Spaniel meanwhile is normally between 17\u201320 in (43\u201351 cm) high at the shoulder, and weighing 55\u201385 lb (25\u201339 kg).One of the noticeable features is their golden liver-coloured coat which is unique to the breed. Historically however, there have also been examples of both black and sandy coloured Sussex Spaniels. The coat is thick (sometimes with a slight wave to it), feathering on the chest, legs and ears and consists of a weather-resistant undercoat with a silky outer coat. The eyes are hazel in colour. The silky ears are lobe-shaped typical of the Spaniel, and set moderately low. The Sussex is a short, stocky kind of dog.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Sussex Spaniel is a slow-paced, calm breed with somewhat clownish behaviour that normally keeps his energy and enthusiasm in check.  He is always eager to be around people, is excellent around children, and can be quite protective of the family. They make excellent candidates for therapy dog work.  Most Sussex Spaniels are primarily family pets, but they are competent enough to aid a hunter though quite stubborn to train. They tend to have a natural ability to quarter in the field, have excellent noses, and can be used to retrieve, given training. The breed is the only spaniel to howl once a game's scent is picked up.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThe breed is generally healthy with an average life span of 12 to 15 years. Hip dysplasia, a genetic malformation of the hip joint, may be a concern but because of the breed's compact nature is not often seriously debilitating. Surveys conducted by the Orthopedic Foundation For Animals showed that 41.5% of Sussex Spaniels were affected by hip dysplasia, and the breed was ranked 9th worst affected out of 157 breeds.Another common condition is otitis externa (outer ear infections), which is common to a variety of spaniels, as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making them more prone to recurrent infections than dogs with more upright ears. The infections can be caused by a variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi and generally dirt and germs. Treatment is relatively simple and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.Whelping sometimes presents difficulties and require caesarean section for successful delivery of the puppies.\n\nHeart conditions in the Sussex Spaniel can include pulmonary valve stenosis, which is the most common of the congenital heart defects. Essentially, in an animal with this condition, the pulmonary valve is improperly formed which causes the heart to work much faster to pump blood around the body. The final results of this condition can be swelling of fluid in the chambers of the heart, thickening of the heart muscle known as ventricular hypertrophy leading to eventual heart failure.Patent ductus arteriosus also appears in the breed. It is a condition where a small blood vessel connecting two major arteries does not close following birth. It can cause complications as it is positioned to allow the blood flow to bypass the lungs. It also appears in American Staffordshire Terriers.A heart condition uncommon to the breed is tetralogy of Fallot, which is more common in the Keeshond and English Bulldog breeds relatively. It is actually a combination of up to four conditions, including the previously mentioned pulmonary valve stenosis, with a secondary condition of right ventricular hypertrophy. The other conditions are ventricular septal defect which is a defect or hole in the wall of the heart between the two ventricles and the aorta which carries the blood from the left to the right side of the heart can be mis-positioned. The effect on the dog depends on the severity of the condition, and can range from a heart murmur through to reduced activity levels to death. Symptoms in puppies are generally a failure to grow and a reduced tolerance for exercise. Active treatment is effective in around 50% of cases.\n\n\n=== Intervertebral disc syndrome ===\nAlso commonly called spinal disc herniation, this is where the intervertebral disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. When the cord is compressed, the dog can experience symptoms ranging in scope from mild back or neck pain to paralysis of limbs, loss of sensation, and loss of bladder or bowel control. It is most commonly seen in the mid-back area, but can occur anywhere along the spine. Mild cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal in a crate to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, which can be accompanied by pain medication. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1795, John Mad Jack Fuller of Rose Hill (now known as Brightling Park, Brightling in East Sussex, England began breeding gun dogs to work in districts where the terrain was rough and the undergrowth very dense which meant that a spaniel was needed which could give tongue or to alert the hunter on his quarry. Fuller crossed various breeds such as the liver and white Norfolk Spaniel (now extinct), the Field Spaniel, and possibly some early English Springer Spaniels. The Sussex was bred specifically to inherit the barking ability that was not common in most Spaniel breeds during this era.The Sussex Spaniel was one of the first ten breeds admitted into the stud book by the American Kennel Club in 1884, but lost what little popularity it had achieved in the 1940s. During World War II, breeding was discouraged but  the Sussex saved from extinction by English breeder Joy Freer. All modern Sussex Spaniels are descended from the dogs she saved. In 1947, only ten Sussex Spaniels were registered in the English Kennel Club.In 2004 the breed was identified as a vulnerable native breed by Kennel Club of Great Britain which are described as having annual registration figures of less than 300 per year. In 2008, only 56 puppies were registered.In 2009 a Sussex Spaniel named \"Clussexx Three D Grinchy Glee,\" call name \"Stump,\" won best in show at the 133rd Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. At 10 years old, Stump is the oldest dog to win this title.The breed is more popular in the United States than any other country. It is recognised by the Continental Kennel Club, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale, American Kennel Club, Kennel Club of Great Britain, Canadian Kennel Club, National Kennel Club, New Zealand Kennel Club, and the American Canine Registry.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSussex Spaniel Association\nSussex Spaniel Club of America"}, {"id": 468, "name": "Swedish Lapphund", "country": "Sweden", "type": "Northern Breed", "picture": "dog468", "description": "The Swedish Lapphund (Swedish: Svensk lapphund) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type from Sweden, one of three Lapphund breeds developed from a type of dog used by the Sami people for herding and guarding their reindeer.\nThe expression \"the black beauty of Norrland\" is very often attributed to the Swedish lapphund, which is most likely one of Sweden's oldest breeds.\n\n\n== Lineage ==\nThe breed falls under the mitochondrial DNA sub-clade referred to as d1 that is only found in northern Scandinavia. It is the result of a female wolf-male dog hybridization that occurred post-domestication. Subclade d1 originated 480-3,000 years ago and is found in all Sami-related breeds: Finnish Lapphund, Swedish Lapphund, Lapponian Herder, Jamthund, Norwegian Elkhound and H\u00e4llefors Elkhound. The maternal wolf sequence that contributed to these breeds has not been matched across Eurasia and its branch on the phylogenetic tree is rooted in the same sequence as the 33,000 year-old Altai dog (not a direct ancestor).\nRefer: Ancient dog-wolf hybridization\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Swedish lapphund has its origins among the ancient hunting tribes of northern Scandinavia, from the land that the S\u00e1mi people call Sapmi. In S\u00e1mi mythology it is said that the lapphund sought the post of worker amongst the S\u00e1mi people in exchange that it would always be well-treated. The lapphund has been used mainly for hunting and guarding. When the S\u00e1mi people started to keep domestic reindeer in the mid-18th century, the lapphund's repertoire was expanded to include herding.\nHard work in the barren landscape of northern Scandinavia  has created a very resilient breed. The shifting climate demands a  weatherproof coat that is easy to maintain. The rough terrain and the varied work demand a dog with endurance, agility, intelligence and independence. The resulting Swedish lapphund is a well-rounded working dog, well suited both for work as a farm, hunting, and herding dog, and as a pet.\n\n\n== Today ==\nLike all spitz dogs in general, the Swedish lapphund demands a stable upbringing and both regular mental and physical stimulation to perform at its best.\nAs a working dog they show their versatility in a number of different fields.\nMany compete with success in such widely different disciplines as obedience,\ndog agility trials, working contest, freestyle/heelwork to music, Rally obedience, and blood\ntracking. The Swedish Lapphund can also participate in herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Lapphunds exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.The breed also has a number of certificated search and rescue dogs and army dogs. The Swedish lapphund is also a very multifaceted hunting dog, mainly used for hunting elk and forest birds, but also deer, wild boar\nand bear. It is also a skilled tracking dog in searching for wounded or killed game. In addition to their versatility as working animals, the breed is also extremely popular as a competitive show dog.\nIn Sweden dogs have their temperament tested by a system called mentalbeskrivning. Results for the Swedish lapphund show a curious, intrepid,\nand friendly breed which is playful and non-aggressive.\nThey are easily trained, strong, and very devoted to their family. Early training is essential to prevent excessive barking.\nThe Swedish lapphund is a typical spitz. It is rectangularly built, slightly under\nmedium size with a good carriage. It moves effortless with drive, light, springy\nand covering ground. Despite that they are gifted with a dense and long, shining\ncoat, they are very easy to groom. Some brushings when the coat is shedding is\nenough to keep the coat in good condition.The special coat does not smell doggy\nand is cleans itself from dirt, so it requires little maintenance. The coat colour is\nblack or bear brown, sometimes with white marks on tail, chest and feet. It has a\nprofuse double coat with hair standing straight out from the body; undercoat is\ndense and very finely curled. Coat colours are mostly black and liver, but a white patch on the chest is also common.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFinnish Lapphund\nLapponian Herder\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 469, "name": "Swedish Vallhund", "country": "Sweden", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog469", "description": "The Swedish Vallhund, also known as the V\u00e4stg\u00f6taspets and Swedish cow dog, is a breed of dog native to Sweden. The breed's name, Vallhund, when translated into English, means herding dog, as the Swedish Vallhund was originally bred as a drover and herder of cows over 1,000 years ago. In 1942, the dog came close to extinction, but careful breeding and publicity by Swedish national Bjorn von Rosen and K. G. Zettersten managed to revive the breed in popularity and save it from its likely end. In 1943, the Swedish Kennel Club recognized the Swedish Vallhund as a breed, and officially categorized the Swedish Vallhund as \"the V\u00e4stg\u00f6taspets\" for V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland, the province in which their revival took place. Since then, the breed has been recognized by, and bred in, over ten countries and has gained some popularity.\n\n\n== Physical features ==\nThe average height of the Swedish Vallhund, measured at the withers, is approximately 33 cm (12.9 in) for males and 31 cm (12.2 in) for females. They are strong, with a long body. The ratio of height to body length is about 2:3. The head of the Vallhund is wedge-shaped, with dark brown oval eyes and pricked ears. They are born with every variance of tail length, from no tail at all to full length, therefore they are often mistaken for having been docked. (Tail docking is illegal in Sweden.)\n\n\n== Colour and coat ==\nThe coat is short and harsh, with a tight topcoat and a soft, dense undercoat. The hair on the foreparts of the legs is slightly longer than that of the neck, chest and back parts of the hind legs. Fur color varies from grey, greyish brown and greyish yellow to reddish brown, with darker hair on the back, neck, and sides of the body. Lighter hair in the same shade of color as mentioned above can be seen on the muzzle, throat, chest, belly, buttocks, feet and hocks. They have lighter markings on their shoulders, also known as harness markings. Some dogs have white patches which appear, to a small extent, as a narrow blaze, neckstop or slight necklace, as well as having white markings on their fore and hindlegs and on the chest. The maximum is 30% white.\n\n\n== Health and lifespan ==\nThe Swedish Vallhund is generally a healthy dog. Its small stature contributes to its longevity, with an average lifespan of 15 years. Its pointy ears mean that\u2014unlike dog breeds with long, hanging ears\u2014ear problems are rare. This breed does well in hot climates because of its double layer coat, as long as the dog is provided cool shade and water. The breed does not do well in very deep snow because of its short legs. The Vallhund has an inherited type of progressive retinal atrophy disease in 34.9% of the population, which appears as mild to moderate night-blindness around the age of ten.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe Vallhund can compete in: dog agility trials, obedience, rally obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, hiking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Vallhunds that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Swedish Vallhund is an ancient, national dog breed of Sweden and may date back to the 8th or 9th century. Swedish Vallhunds originated in the county of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland, which lies just south of lake V\u00e4nern. Here the small dog proved to be excellent for watching, guarding and herding. The breed dates to the Viking settlement of England and is thought to have played a part in the development of the modern Welsh Corgi and the Lancashire Heeler. According to the American Kennel Club, another theory of the breed's origin is that during the eighth or ninth century \"either the Swedish Vallhund was brought to Wales or the Corgi was taken to Sweden, hence the similarities between the two breeds\".The Swedish Vallhund is related to larger spitz dogs and moose hunting dogs of Scandinavia. Large dogs of this spitz-type have been found buried with their masters in stone-age settlements in Scandinavia. The skeleton of a Swedish Vallhund is remarkably similar to that of the modern Norwegian Elkhound, another breed of spitz dog.\n\nSwedish Vallhund\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSerpell J., The Domestic Dog, Its Evolution.

This breed is believed to be extinct by most authorities.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Tahltan was built somewhere between the lines of the spitz and pariah types. The ideal dog was, above all else, athletic and agile.\nAs they were always bred solely for hunting value, appearance could vary significantly between dogs.\n\n\n=== Coat and colour ===\nA Tahltan Bear Dog was primarily black, dark brown or blue, with some white patches on the chest and sometimes the feet. Standing 14 to 17 inches high at the shoulder, with relatively large, erect pointed ears, with a refined, pointed muzzle. The glossy coat was of average length, with guard hairs covering a thicker undercoat. Paws some what webbed and relatively large for the size of the dog. They were bred to be double jointed and gaited, enabling them to switch gaits as they moved through different terrain or heavy brush, as were all the aboriginal dogs of the North and South American continents. \nLike others of their group, they had a peculiar yodel. Foxy in appearance, their main distinction among dogs is their novel tail. Short, bushy and carried erect, it has been described variously as a shaving brush or a whisk broom.\n\n\n== History ==\nRaised by the Tahltan people to hunt bears, the Tahltan Bear Dog was a mighty power in a small package. Before a hunt, the dogs were ceremonially bled by stabbing them in the hindquarters with the fibula bone of a fox or wolf. The morning of the hunt, two dogs were carried in a sack over the hunter's shoulder until fresh bear tracks were sighted. Upon release, these little dogs moved lightly over the crust of snow while the bear was slowed down by the deep drifts. Their fox-like staccato yaps harassed the bear into submission or confused it until the hunter could come close enough for a kill. To prepare for a foray against big cats, a claw from a dead lynx was used to ceremonially mark the dog's face.\nThe Tahltan Bear Dog had the courage to face a bear, but was friendly and gentle with smaller \nanimals and with humans. They lived in the tent with the family, sharing bed and board.\nDescended from pariah-type dogs that had come with prehistoric migrations, the Tahltan Dogs were centralized in the remote mountainous areas of northwestern British Columbia and the Southern Yukon. Their usual diet was small bits of birds, meat and fish, and they flourished in the bitter cold. Outside their native environment, they succumbed to distemper, heat prostration and problems due to dietary changes. As white explorers came into the territory, bringing a variety of other dogs, the Tahltan Dog became diluted.\nThere are no living descendants past 1960-70. Genetic references in the archeological record show no modern relationship of Tahltan dogs to any modern populations.  No modern breeds have any known genetic relationship with extant dogs.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTahltan Bear Dog image\nThe Complete 'Tail' of the Tahltan Bear Dog"}, {"id": 471, "name": "Taigan", "country": "Kyrgyzstan", "type": "", "picture": "dog471", "description": "The Taigan (Kyrgyz: \u0422\u0430\u0439\u0433\u0430\u043d) also known as Kyrgyzdyn Taighany (Kyrgyzskaya Borzaya Taigan in Russian) is a sighthound breed from Kyrgyzstan, which is not yet recognized by the FCI, but is recognized by a number of kennel clubs on national level.\nThey have medium-length and slightly curly hair and are similar in shape to Greyhounds.\nThey are a member of the sighthound family.\n\n\n== Origin and history ==\nSame as Azawakh, Sloughi, Saluki, Afghan Hound and Mid-Asiatic Tazi, the Taigan is a member of the family of Eastern Sighthounds, which can be found from Northern Africa to Central Asia. \nDuring most periods of their history, the Kyrgyz have been a predominantly nomadic people, which has migrated through vast parts of Siberia and Central Asia. Therefore it is very unlikely that the origins of the Taigan can be traced back to one single ancestor. However, the Taigan in its present form is a pronounced mountain breed, perfectly adapted to its work in the alpine regions of the Tian Shan mountain range.  \nIn the 1930s, Soviet cynologists began to register the existing specimens in the Kyrgyz SSR, but this work had to be stopped after the German invasion of the USSR in 1941. In 1964, the USSR laid down the first standard for the breed. Different from many western countries, live coursing has always been legal in the Soviet Union; hunters were organised in kolkhozy and had to deliver certain amounts of fur to the collective farms. \nAfter Kyrgyzstan became independent in 1991, the role of the breed underwent a change. The collapse of the collective farms forced many people in the rural areas of Kyrgyzstan to return to the nomadic life of their ancestors. For some of them, hunting with the Taigan became again an occupation which helps them to earn their living. On the other hand, parts of the new urban upper class have discovered the Taigan as a prestigious symbol of national heritage during the past few years. In 1995, the Cinologist Council of the Kyrgyz Republic (a body connected with the Ministry of Agriculture) adopted a new breed standard, which was later approved by the hunting commission at the Ministry of Environmental Protection. A number of breed shows were held in Bishkek, but with only small attendance by hunters from the countryside.  \nDuring a state visit to Norway in November 2003, the former Kyrgyz president Askar Akayev gave two Taigan puppies as a present to King Harald V and prime minister Kjell Magne Bondevik. This caused a small diplomatic turmoil, since the Norwegian import regulations require a quarantine of four months for dogs entering Norway from a non-European country, and neither the king nor the prime minister were willing to keep the dogs. To avoid hurting the feelings of the Kyrgyz delegation, the mayor of the city of Trondheim, Rita Ottervik, decided to take care of the two puppies, which were later given to experienced dog owners after they had passed quarantine.Since 2005, a national kennel club exists in Kyrgyzstan, which has been admitted to the FCI as a contact partner in 2009. This would now enable Kyrgyzstan to apply for international recognition of the Taigan, provided that an application will be sent to the FCI breed standard commission. However, the FCI member clubs in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland and Germany have already recognized the Taigan on national level.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Taigan is a sighthound, which is a bit larger than medium height. The minimal height for male specimens is 65 cm and for females 60 cm. The colours are black, black with white (most common), grey, brown and yellow (or other shades and variations of this color) and white. Areas of dark colored coat may have white marks. The coat is soft, long, and thick. In the winter, undercoat is developed. The ears are drooping, thick and covered with long, soft, wavy fur. A distinguishing mark of the Taigan is the ring on the end of the tail - the base vertebras of the ring are jointed, so that the ring cannot be unrolled. \nThe large volume of the lungs, the (in comparison to other sighthounds) strong bone structure and the thick coat enable the Taigan to work in rugged terrain, and at elevations up to 4000 m above sea level.\n\n\n== Use and activity ==\nThe Taigan is a sighthound adapted to the extreme mountainous conditions in the Tian Shan. Typical prey are ibex, roe deer, wolf, fox and marmot. Some hunters also use the Taigan in conjunction with a trained bird of prey, especially with the golden eagle. The hunt for the Tolai hare (Lepus tolai), is, however, an exception.\nDue to the rugged surface of its native environment, the Taigan hunts with all senses, i.e. unlike other sighthounds not only by sight, but also by scent and hearing, which gives its hunting style some similarities with breeds like Ibizan Hound or Pharaoh Hound. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAssociation \"Kirghizcynology\" (Russian)\nwww.taigany.republika.pl (Poland)"}, {"id": 472, "name": "Taiwan Dog", "country": "Taiwan", "type": "", "picture": "dog472", "description": "The Taiwan Dog (Chinese: \u53f0\u7063\u72ac) is a breed or landrace of small or medium dog indigenous to Taiwan. These dogs are also known as Formosan Mountain Dog, Taiwanese Canis, Taiwanese Native Dog (\u53f0\u7063\u571f\u72d7) or Takasago Dog (\u9ad8\u7802\u72ac). They are well-adapted to the uneven and thickly forested terrain of Taiwan, having become a semi-wild breed prior to the arrival of several colonial reigns and foreign powers.  Notwithstanding these adaptations, Formosans retained the potential to be trained, and are now used as hunting dogs, guard dogs, stunt dogs, rescue dogs, or simply as companions.  Formosans are classified into one medium type and two small types.\nHowever, now the pureblood Formosan Mountain Dog is edging closer to extinction, due to limited conservation efforts of the Taiwanese and their government. The Taiwan Dog is closely related to the Dingo and New Guinea Singing dog.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\n There are two small types of the Formosan Mountain Dog; one is about 40 centimetres (16 in) tall at the shoulder, and the other is around 30 centimetres (12 in). However, the latter one was not found during the research conducted by Dr. Sung Yung-yi (\u5b8b\u6c38\u7fa9) in 1976. The medium type of the Formosan Mountain Dog has a shoulder height under 50 centimetres (20 in), with a firm and fit body, slim waist, big chest, and half-covered ears. The most common type of these three in recent years is the medium-sized dog. Its color can range from black to earthy yellow or yellowish brown, and the nose is black. Black coating on the tongue is one of the most distinguished traits of the Formosan Mountain Dog.Dr. Sung of National Taiwan University and Mr. Ming Jie, Xu of Formosan Dog & Guard Dogs Breeding Center (\u53f0\u7063\u72ac\u8b77\u885b\u72ac\u7e41\u6b96\u4e2d\u5fc3) described a typical Formosan as having almond eyes, firm jaw strength, black coating on the tongue, a triangular face, thin prick ears, and a sickle tail. The tail is upright or curved with a thick fur coat, but the belly is hairless; the tail is used to warm the belly, and may even be long enough to protect the snout from insects. The dog is also well known for being well-balanced.\n\n\n=== Movement ===\nFormosan dogs are particularly agile; they are known for their hopping skill, especially when they are hunting small animals, such as rats. When they are startled or trying to intimidate their target, they will hop sideways back and forth. Unlike Rottweilers and German Shepherds, Formosan dogs do not hold their bite on their target. This habit is adopted and may be traced back to early boar hunting. Taiwanese aborigines used 5-6 Formosan dogs to circle a wild boar, and each dog would work to wound the boar. They would release their bite once they had attacked it and wait for the next attack again and again until the boar was exhausted enough for their master to move in for the final kill.\n\n\n=== Temperament and behaviour ===\nThe Formosan is a high energy, loyal, affectionate, and intelligent breed that learns very quickly.  In unfamiliar situations, they tend to be wary of strangers and sounds, and they can become fear-aggressive. In new situations where the dog is fear-aggressive, it can take a few days before the dog will calm down.\nIf comfortable and well-trained, the Formosan will be friendly to people and other animals, though they tend to be a bit aloof or suspicious of strangers once they have bonded with their owner.  Once bonded, they are extremely loyal and affectionate to their owners.\nDue to the breed's alertness, these dogs can make good guard dogs; if not well-trained, the Formosan can become overly protective and aggressive toward strangers.\n\n\n==== Standard ====\n\nProportions\nDepth of chest:height at withers = 4.5:10 to 4.7:10\nHeight at withers:length of body =  10:10.5, bitches can be slightly longer.\nLength of muzzle:length of skull = 4.5:5.5.\nSize & weight\nHeight: Dogs: 48\u201352 cm (19\u201320 in)    Bitches: 43\u201347 cm (17\u201319 in)\nWeight: Dogs: 14 to 18 kg (31 to 40 lb)    Bitches: 12 to 16 kg (26 to 35 lb)\nHead\nCranial Region:\nForehead: Broad and roundish, without wrinkles.\nSkull: The skull is slightly longer than the muzzle.\nStop: Well defined with a slight furrow.\nFacial Region :\nNose: Moderate size.

After the Dutch made Taiwan a colony, they began to import workers from Fujian and Penghu (Pescadores) as laborers, many of whom settled.\nThe Dutch military presence was concentrated at a stronghold called Castle Zeelandia. The Dutch colonists imported a hunting dog (known as the \"Flying Dog.\" Traditional Chinese: \u98db\u72d7) to Taiwan and started to hunt the native Formosan Sika deer (Cervus nippon taioanus) that inhabited Taiwan. Dutch East India Company, established a trading post whose main business was the export of sika skins to Europe. During the six decades of Dutch activity two to four million sika skins were exported to Europe. Contributing to the eventual extinction of the subspecies on the island. The \"Flying Dog\" was thought to be Greyhound or Pointer.Exporting was reduced when the Dutch were forced out of Taiwan in 1684, but continued throughout the Qing period with a switch to Japan as the major export market.During the settlement, the Dutch hunting dog started cross-bred with the Formosan Mountain Dog; this was the first time that foreign breeds had influenced the Formosan Mountain Dog. Furthermore, the Dutch prohibited native tribes from owning dogs, slaughtering large numbers of indigenous dogs.\n\n\n==== Japanese rule ====\nThe Qing Empire was defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95. When the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed on April 17, 1895, Taiwan was ceded to Japan, which sought to transform Taiwan into the supply-end of an extremely unequal flow of assets The Japanese made efforts to exert full control over the Aborigines, the first time this had ever been carried out. The means of accomplishing this goal took three main forms: anthropological study of the natives of Taiwan, attempts to reshape the Aborigines in the mould of the Japanese, and military suppression. During Japanese occupation, Taiwanese aboriginals were under repressive rule, and the Formosan Mountain Dog was intensively cross-bred with Japanese dogs, due to the Japanese government relocating many remote high-mountain villages closer to administrative control (Takekoshi 1907:210\u2013219). Furthermore, Japanese immigrants massively explored the east coast, currently called Hualien and Taitung Counties. The east coast expeditions further provided a chance of cross-breeding Japanese dogs with the Formosan.\n\n\n==== World War II ====\nAt the end of World War II, for military purposes and preventing US Army landing on the east coast of Taiwan, Japan started to build the Central and Southern Cross-Island Highway. During the construction, there were military dogs traveling with the highway workers, the German Shepherds. This led to cross-breeding between the Formosan and the military dog. If it were not for these strategic constructions, the Formosan may have had a chance to preserve their bloodline high in the mountains. Furthermore, during this period, there was evidence showing that the Japanese military launched a massacre to reduce the population of the Formosan Mountain Dog. However, the true reason for this may not be known.\nDr. Sung Yung-yi told a New Taiwan journalist: \"Formosan dogs are very smart and agile, but they are more primitive animal, and do not want to be caged. For example, during birth period, they will find a cave and usually will not return until few months later with their puppies. Another example will be the masters do not need to provide a lot of foods for them, they have the habit of finding their own foods. These were the reason Formosan was called the \"barbarian dog,\" by Japanese. Using sanitation as an excuse, Japanese military launched a large-scale massacre of Formosan to reduce the local dog population.\"\nDuring the time when the Japanese military was building the Central and Southern Cross-Island Highway, they were constantly encountered by the aborigines. The aborigines launched numerous assaults to the Japanese military bases. During the assaults, Formosan dogs also gathered and hunted down Japanese military dogs, leaving a bloody scene in the morning. For revenge, the Japanese military killed every Formosan dog they saw to reduce the Formosan population.\n\n\n==== Kuomintang Era ====\nSung Yung-yi believes that the true reason that led to Formosan Mountain Dog's extinction is the dog-eating culture. It was brought in along with the Chinese Nationalist Party's retreat in 1945, due to the loss to the Soviet-supported Communist Party of China (led by Mao Zedong) at the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1945.Furthermore, after Taiwan was handed over to the Kuomintang, the son of Chiang Kai-shek, Chiang Ching-kuo successfully reformed Taiwan to an economic little dragon (Four Asian Tigers), he was credited for the Taiwan economic miracle, and has served as role model for many developing countries. Nevertheless, great economic comes with great price, with economic development and open society, businessmen from around the world start to introduce high-priced foreign dogs and Japanese dogs into Taiwan. With lack of conservative and pet care knowledge, many foreign dogs were abandoned and start crossbreeding with Formosan Dogs. Dr. Sung believes that these are the two true reason that affect Formosan Mountain Dog's living space and the space for existence.\n\n\n== Threat ==\n\n\n=== Crossbreeding ===\nThe introduction of a variety of foreign dogs to Taiwan in the past was also a big threat to preserving the blood line of the Formosan.  A lot of dogs non-native to Taiwan were brought over during the \"Kuomingtang\" Era, and many were released into the wild.  These began mating with the native Formosan, making pure bred Formosans harder and harder to find in the wild.\n\n\n=== Breeding problems ===\nThe Formosan Mountain Dog was originally kept by aboriginal Taiwanese as hunting dogs, but now purebred Formosans are extremely rare and valuable. Since pure Formosans are extremely rare, there is a high risk of genetic disorder and unstable behavior due to the shallow gene pool. For this reason, crossing Foromosans with other breeds occurred often due to the lack of pure females with steady traits. This is one of the major reasons modern Formosans look different, compared to old photos or documents from the early days. Some insist it is a natural change which does not affect the whole breed, while others actively fight to preserve the \"pure\" bloodline. Nevertheless, this breed is now popular all across the island as a watch and companion dog.\n\n\n=== Dog meat ===\nDog meat is known as \"fragrant meat\" (\u9999\u8089 xi\u0101ng r\u00f2u) in Taiwan. Dog meat was never commonly eaten in general, and when it was eaten, it was usually only eaten during winter.  But those that did partake in eating dog meat would frequently consume the meat of the black Formosan.  In Traditional Chinese Medicine, dog meat was claimed to help retain body warmth. In 2004 though, consuming dog meat was banned by the Taiwanese government, due to both pressure from domestic animal-welfare groups and a desire to improve international perceptions, although there were some protests to the ban.\nIt is still possible to find dog meat in some rural areas, but this is becoming increasingly rare.\n\n\n== Study ==\nTaiwan Dogs are originally native Taiwanese dogs, descendants of the South Asian hunting dogs called the \"Pariah dog\" which ancient local inhabitants used to live with in the central mountainous districts. This breed was the loyal companion of the ancient hunter in the wild forest. In 1980, a cooperative study was carried out by the National Taiwan University, Japanese Gifu University, and Ota Keming's(\u592a\u7530\u514b\u660e) research team from Nagoya University. Scholars targeted native Taiwan dogs as their subject, by visiting twenty-nine tribes of local inhabitants. As a result, it was confirmed that the present Taiwan Dog is a descendant of the South Asian hunting dogs. This project was originally Ota Keming's idea, as he was tracing the origin of Japanese indigenous dog, so he sought Sung Yung-yi's help in completing his research project.\nOf the 46 purebloods that Sung Yung-yi found during 1976-1980, blood tests showed that they were related to dogs found in Southern Japan and that they were descendants of the South Asian Hunting Dog (Needs source reference). Little known outside of Taiwan, only \"purebred\" Formosans are recognized with a pedigree from the Kennel Club of Taiwan (KCT) Taiwan Kennel Club and the international canine organization known as FCI [[1]].\n\n\n== Current ==\n\n\n=== Conservation status ===\nSince 1976, many Taiwanese ecologists have tried to convince the Taiwanese government to take action on forming a Formosan research team to help and preserve the pure indigenous Formosan by potentially replicating the dingo's model from Australia. The most notable action taken was by Dr. Sung Yung-yi. In 1983, he spoke at a conference on the Formosan Sika Deer and requested Taiwan's government to take immediate action to protect Formosan Dogs. Dr. Sung's request was made because he and his colleagues had difficulties in finding pure-blood Formosan Mountain Dogs during his five-year studies from 1976 to 1980. In order to find sufficient population for his study, he located 29 Taiwanese aboriginal villages in the mountain ranges and initiated a mass search. Nevertheless, only 46 out of 160 Formosan Mountain Dogs he found had an A-rank purity. Out of these 46 Formosans, 25 were males and 21 were females. This number alerted the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, as the animal was close to extinction.\nDr. Sung told the New Taiwan News that, to this day, people in Taiwan do not have a strong respect for biodiversity. Dr. Sung believed that a Formosan Mountain Dog rehabilitation program should be encouraged by government efforts and carried out by careful planning. Currently, reproduction is the most urgent task. He believes, every Formosan Dog should be registered to a household, which specified mating. In recent years, Taiwan's government had not taken any action in protecting these indigenous Formosan Dogs. Dr. Sung also said that after learning how Taiwan's government handled the Formosan Sika Deer Rehabilitation Project, he was discouraged, and did not dare have any thoughts on launching a conservation project for Formosan Dog. He said, \"For a developed country, Taiwan currently is not one yet.\"\n\n\n=== Security/Guard Dog ===\nCurrently, the ROC Air Force is considering the Formosan Dog for military purposes. At this time the ROC Air Force is using German Shepherds for security, but German Shepherds have some downsides.  For instance, it was often found that German Shepherds who perform intensive security duties on a daily basis will suffer from serious bruising on their paws. Furthermore, they found that many German Shepherds' guarding mechanism towards strangers was not quite at the desired sensitivity.  In many cases, strangers will need to get close for the dog to react.  These factors caused the ROC Air Force to look to replace German Shepherds.\nAfter half a month of testing, the ROC Air Force concluded that the Formosan Mountain Dog's sense of smell, hearing, dexterity, and alertness towards strangers were all more suitable for the purpose of guarding their fighter jets.  More importantly, the Formosan Mountain Dog does not suffer from the bruising of the paws as the German Shepherds do. For this reason, it is likely that the ROC Air Force will replace German Shepherds with Formosan Mountain Dogs.  The only concern for the ROC Air Force is that the Formosan Mountain Dog is physically less intimidating than a German Shepherd.  Recently, the feasibility of replacing German Shepherds with Formosan Mountain Dogs has been tested.\n\n\n=== Breeder ===\nMost of the foundation stock owners and breeders are hesitant to make public appearances. They stay behind the scenes and sell only males to those who have Formosan dog kennels and attend local dog shows. The most well-known and high-profile breeder is Ming Nan Chen. Like many born in the 1950s, Chen owned a Formosan as a child. In the 1980s he started a business dedicated to creating a pure-bred Formosan close to the one in his childhood memory, beginning with a single puppy that he purchased for NT$30,000 (about US$910.00) from an aborigine man.However, some argue that credit must be given to those breeders, as they are the ones who are keeping the bloodline pure. After two or three decades of breeding, training, improving, and purification, it is now unable to fully distinguish the indigenous and the new breed. Further, it is also due to the subjective preferences of breeders and their belief of what the pureblooded Formosan should look like, which they created different trend of the \"pure-blood.\" Many claim that their Formosan Mountain Dogs are pureblood. Such breeders also applied the \"new type\" of Formosan Mountain Dogs to the FCI to develop a \"standard\", which may be very different from what it originally should have looked like.\nBreeders also created a conflict in debating for the future of the Formosan Mountain Dogs, as maintaining its purity or modifying through hybridizing it into a new type. For breeders who support purity, they believe that there is no need in improving the breed through hybridization. However, breeders who support modifying believe that, since Formosan Mountain Dogs have been accidentally cross-bred for centuries and it is not possible to identify and maintain its purity, then we should seek a \n\"new type\" of Formosan Mountain Dog with improvements. These two different points of view are still an ongoing debate and remain controversial.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Taiwan Dog at Wikimedia Commons\n\nFormosan Dogs website\nTaiwanese Dogs website\n\"The Dog's Notes\" by Poren Huang"}, {"id": 473, "name": "Talbot (dog)", "country": "United Kingdom, Belgium, France", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog473", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 474, "name": "Tamaskan Dog", "country": "Finland", "type": "", "picture": "dog474", "description": "Tamaskan dogs are a Finnish dog crossbreed to resemble a wolf and wolfdog. It is a cross of several types of sled dogs, including the Siberian Husky and the Alaskan Malamute. Tamaskans have been recognized as a breed by the American Rare Breed Association, although pedigrees are only managed by Tamaskan-specific breeder clubs. It is a highly versatile dog that can excel in agility, obedience and working trials.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nTamaskans are large, athletic dogs, and slightly taller than German Shepherds. With regard to build, they are substantially larger than typical sled dogs but smaller than the Alaskan Malamute.\n\nOn average, Tamaskan adults measure around 24-28 inches (60\u201370 cm) tall at the shoulder and typically weigh between 55-88 pounds (25\u201340 kg)\u2013the heaviest recorded Tamaskan males (to date) weigh just under 50 kg. Females are usually slightly smaller and lighter than males, with a distinct feminine appearance. Males are more heavyset with broader heads and a heavier bone structure. Tamaskans have a lupine appearance with a straight bushy tail and thick double coat that comes in three main colors: wolf gray, red gray, and black gray. Each individual guard hair is agouti banded along its length. The almond-shaped eyes range from yellow through to amber and brown, with lighter colored eyes being very rare. Blue eyes are not acceptable, nor are mismatched eyes.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nOverall, the Tamaskan variety is healthy; only a few notable health issues affect a small percentage of the bloodlines to date. Roughly 10% of males suffer from cryptorchidism: undescended testes. With these cases, usually only one testicle fully descends within the scrotum, while the other testicle remains \"hidden\" up within the abdominal cavity. Epilepsy has been diagnosed in five dogs, affecting about 1 out of every 100 registered Tamaskans worldwide. Several dogs have been found to be carriers of degenerative myelopathy. As with all large breed dogs, hip dysplasia is a risk.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the early 1980s, a breeding back attempt where five dogs, of Siberian Husky origin, were imported into the UK from America. These dogs were then bred to the Siberian Husky, Alaskan Malamute, and German Shepherd, but also possibly other breeds exhibiting a lupine phenotype to form a variety called the Utonagan dog. The Utonagan was perhaps later crossed with the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog to form the Tamaskan dog as it is known today.\nIn 2009, the Tamaskan Dog Register introduced a Saarloos Wolfdog as a single out-cross to bring some fresh blood into the breed.  This particular Saarloos was specifically selected due to his temperament, appearance, and health.\n\n\n=== Breed clubs ===\nThere are breed clubs in the United States (Tamaskan Dog Register), Canada (National Tamaskan Club of Canada), France (Club Fran\u00e7ais du Tamaskan), Germany (Tamaskan Club Germany), the Netherlands (Nederlandse Tamaskan Club), Croatia (Hrvatski Tamaskan Savez), and the United Kingdom (Tamaskan Dog Society of Great Britain).\n\n\n== Famous Tamaskan dogs ==\n\nIn October 2007, a Tamaskan named Genghis Khan featured as a wolf in a music video for the band Lucretia Choir.In September 2010, a TDR registered male Tamaskan named Wave became the official Live Mascot of North Carolina State University's football team: NC State Wolfpack. Wave (a.k.a. \"Tuffy\") now attends most home games and can be seen on the sidelines.In September 2012, four Tamaskans were featured on the Croatian HRT 1 television program Ku\u0107ni ljubimci.In September 2015, a Tamaskan named Adler (White Elk Brighid) appeared in several news outlets including the Daily Mail, the Boston Times, and the Bark Post for mastering the game of Tug-of-War by using her mass instead of her strength.In 2016, a Tamaskan named Luchta (White Elk Luchta) appeared on Broadway.  Luchta played the role of \"The Wolf\" in Arthur Miller's The Crucible produced by Scott Rudin and directed by Ivo van Hove.On September 19, 2017, Kaoru, a four-year-old therapy dog, was accompanied by her owner, another handler, and 10 other dogs on a hiking trail in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. Kaoru provided support to many people, including children with autism. On the hike Kaoru was mistaken for a wolf by a hunter, who shot her at close range, killing her. \n\n\n== See also ==\nCzechoslovakian Wolfdog\nNorthern Inuit Dog\nSaarloos wolfdog\nBreeding back\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Florida Lupine News Volume 9 Issue 3 (Autumn 2007)\nAnimal Wellness Magazine 7447079635 Volume 10 Issue 1 (Feb-Mar 2008)\nDogs Monthly - March 2009 Issue\nDogs Today July 2009 Issue (Pages 24 & 25)\nDogs Today - November 2009 Issue (front cover)\nDogs Today July 2010 Issue\nDogs Today August 2010 Issue\nDogs Today September 2010 Issue\nDas deutsche Hunde Magazin November 2011\n[1]"}, {"id": 475, "name": "Teddy Roosevelt Terrier", "country": "United States", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog475", "description": "The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized American hunting terrier. It is lower-set, with shorter legs, and is more muscular with heavier bone density than the related American Rat Terrier. Much diversity exists in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed, and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha, and Tenterfield Terrier. The Rat Terrier's background is said to stem from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working-class immigrants. Since the breed was a farm, hunting, and utility dog, little to no planned breeding was used  other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other to produce the desired work ethic in the dog. The Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit Dog, and Wry-legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.  These early ratting terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle crossbred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs. Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell. and a very high intellect. Although they tend to be aloof with strangers, they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners at all times.\nThe current UKC standard calls for a Teddy Roosevelt Terrier to be 8\u201315 in (200\u2013380 mm) in height, with weight proportionate to height. Teddy Roosevelt Terriers weighing as much as 25 lb (11 kg) or as little as 8 lb (3.6 kg) are not uncommon.\n\n\n== Breed history ==\nEarly American history shows that the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier, like the Rat Terrier, were often referred to as Feist or just plain terrier mixes - in the case of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier, \"bench-legged feist\".Since the breed was primarily a farm and hunting dog, crossing Rat Terriers to other breeds was common. One such early cross was with the Beagle, and  this cross possibly reinforced the bench leg, since the Bench-legged Beagle was a common hunting companion.Separating the long-legged phenotype from the short-legged phenotype in most cases did not occur, litters born from parents of either or both phenotypes commonly displayed a variety of leg and body length, yet all were still considered and labeled merely as Rat Terriers. In the middle 1990s, efforts to segregate the types began in earnest, but mixing of the two types in some cases still exists today.\n\nWhen the types were separated by the Rat Terrier Club of America, the short-legged variety was named in honor of Theodore Roosevelt, although he never owned Rat Terriers nor was he instrumental in developing the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier. The dog most attributed to being one of the foundations for the Rat Terriers was a black-and-tan, mixed-breed, feist-type dog owned by the Roosevelts. In one of his letters to his children, President Roosevelt writes, \"There is a very cunning little dog named Skip, belonging to John Goff's pack, who has completely adopted me. I think I shall take him home to Archie. He likes to ride on Dr. Lambert's horse, or mine, and though he is not as big as Jack, takes eager part in the fight with every bear and bobcat.\" Often confused with Skip the black and tan feist, the Roosevelts also had a dog named Scamp. Scamp is the only dog mentioned in Roosevelt's letters as ever hunting rats while in the White House, \"Scamp is really an extraordinary ratter and kills a great many rats in the White House, in the cellars and on the lower floor and among the machinery. He is really a very nice little dog.\"  Unfortunately, no pictures of Scamp nor descriptions other than one which describes him as a Fox Terrier have been found. Another terrier which often is confused with the Rat Terrier was Roosevelt's dog named Jack. In Mr. Roosevelt's letter dated July 27, 1902, to Mrs. Roswell Field, he writes, \"It is a real pleasure to send you a photograph of my boy Kermit, with Jack, the Manchester Terrier, who is absolutely a member of the family.\"  Jack was a Manchester Terrier, not a Rat Terrier.\nThe first standard for the breed was developed by the now-defunct Teddy Roosevelt Terrier Club of America in 1996. Currently, several registration organizations are active, all of which have their own standards, but the most commonly accepted are the United Kennel Club  and the United Kennel Club International, although the UKCI still only recognizes them as a variation of the Rat Terrier.\nIn 1999, both \"Rat Terrier\" and \u201cTeddy Roosevelt Terrier\" were accepted as a separate breeds by the United Kennel Club.Currently, the UKC accepts single Teddy Roosevelt Terrier registration applications for dogs from 10 different registries, where they are simply designated as Rat Terriers. [1].\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a low-set, muscular, active, small- to medium-sized hunting terrier. The preferred ratio of length of body (prosternum to point of buttocks) to height (withers to ground) is between 10:7 and 10:8. The head is broad, slightly domed, wedge-shaped, and proportionate to the size of the body. Ears are V-shaped, set at the outside edges of the skull, and may be erect or button. A docked tail is preferred, but a natural bob tail or a natural tail carried in an upward curve is also acceptable. The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier occurs in solid white, other solid colors with markings, and white with a variety of colored patches.\nThe Teddy Roosevelt Terrier should be evaluated as a working terrier, and exaggerations, or faults, should be penalized in proportion to how much they interfere with the dog\u2019s ability to work. Honorable scars resulting from field work are not to be penalized.\n\nDisqualification: A longer-legged, square-bodied dog, whose proportions vary significantly from the desired ratio, lacks breed type, and must be disqualified.\n\n\n== Common characteristics ==\nLike the Rat Terrier, the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier of today is bred for versatility, including hunting instincts, soundness of health, great temperament, and good looks.  Teddy Roosevelt Terriers have higher than average prey drive and will chase squirrels, rats, stray cats, and any other animals they consider prey. They also dig and follow mole trail,s leaving an array of trenches and holes behind. They make excellent watch dogs, and can be very protective and territorial. They share a love for their families and become very attached, craving human interaction and affection. Always by their owners' sides, they become constant shadows, following their masters around throughout the daily routine.\nThese dogs are very smart and loyal, which makes them easy to train. They are energetic and playful, and their antics can make one laugh daily. However, when it is time to settle down, they are just as content to be in a lap.\nThey can adapt to almost any lifestyle, whether shown in conformation rings, working in agility trials, or just a great companion for home or farm. Their  size makes them suitable for apartment living, as well. Today, the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is gaining a solid following and becoming a popular household companion.(Source AKC)\n\n\n== Health problems ==\nLess common problems may include allergies, bite problems (malocclusions), hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, and subluxating patella, as these are problems that appear in the related Rat Terrier.\nEctopia lentis, a congenital condition, also affects this breed. Although not currently well-documented in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier, it is seen in small numbers and populations according to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, but is still seen in higher numbers in the Rat Terrier and other terrier breeds.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBishop, Joseph Bucklin, ed.

Though rare, it remains the only known Malaysian dog breed to live outside its homeland. Malaysian are used to called this dog breed Anjing Kampung which means Village dog in Malay. This dog breed still remains one of the rarest in the world. \n\n\n== History ==\nTelomians were originally bred as vermin-controlling hunting dogs by the Orang Asli indigenous people of Malaysia. Telomians developed an unusual climbing ability, as the Orang Asli built their houses on stilts in order to avoid contact with dangerous animals on the ground. Certain cynologists have proposed that the telomian may be the missing link between the Basenji and the dingo. Although the Malayan natives kept dogs, they considered them to be nonetheless unlucky, and treacherous animals which longed for the deaths of their master. To see a feral dog was considered doubly unfortunate, as such animals were considered to be evil spirits.They were officially discovered by the West in 1963, by anthropologist Dr Orville Elliot, who named the breed after the Telom River where he first found them. A pair of dogs was brought to the United States, with a Telomian Dog Club being established in 1970. A second pair of telomians was imported to the US in 1973 and it is believed that all Telomians in the West descend from these two domesticated pairs.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe telomian is a small breed with an elongated back. The short and smooth coat can be any shade of sable, with white and ticking. A black mask is not unusual. Adults are 15-18 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 18-28 lbs. Like the chow chow, the breed has a blue tongue. The dingo, New Guinea Singing Dog, and the telomian have a single annual estrus cycle, which peaks during September through October.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCanaan Dog\nDingo\nNew Guinea Singing Dog\nIndian pariah dog\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 477, "name": "Tenterfield Terrier", "country": "Australia", "type": "", "picture": "dog477", "description": "Australian in development, the forebears of the Tenterfield Terrier accompanied British settlers en route to Australia by ship. The forebears of these small dogs had been bred for ratting. This type of dog suited shipboard life, where rats and mice were both a health hazard and a threat to food supplies. Today they are a strong, active, hardy and agile dog, their smooth short coat making them 'easy care' family companions.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nTenterfield terriers must be predominantly white as required by he the Breed Standard of the ANKC. They are not exaggerated in any features. They have a square or compact body, a wedge shaped head with equal length from occiput to stop and stop to the end of the nose. This gives the head parallel head planes, making the head unusual in this Group. The Tenterfield Terrier may also have semi-erect ears or pricked ears, the latter being more common. Tenterfield Terriers stand around 28 cm (11 inches) high and can come in tan and white, black and white, liver/tan/white tri-coloured or black/tan/white tri-coloured. Their unique feature is their naturally occurring bob tail which can come in any length.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe forebears of the Tenterfield Terrier accompanied Australia's first European settlers who sailed from Portsmouth in England's South. These dogs were vermin killers, and so the smallest of them were selected to play that role on ships, which is how they arrived in Australia. Large dogs may would not have fared as well in the cramped shipboard environment, where vermin find nooks and crannies. Thus small terriers had an advantage. Miniature individuals of the Fox Terrier breed suited the role, as their original breeding matched the new task closely.\nBy the late 19th century a dog type known as the Miniature Fox Terrier (known colloquially as \"Mini Foxies\") was well established in rural Australia as a vermin killer and family companion. By the 1920s the dog was a fixture in urban households.The name \"Tenterfield\" does not denote the terrier\u2019s place of origin as Tenterfield, New South Wales. Rather, the name derives from there. The dog was bred extensively in and around northern New South Wales. Tenterfield is one of many localities in Australia in which small terriers of this type were kept. The town of Tenterfield is significant in Australian history for the Tenterfield Oration on independence from Britain. Additionally, the owner of the town's saddlery a man named George Woolnough, was immortalized by his grandson entertainer Peter Allen as the \"Tenterfield Saddler\".  Tenterfield residents attest that Mr. Woolnough  owned and loved a number of these terriers, though unfortunately no photographs of his dogs are known.\nAccordingly, the name Tenterfield Terrier was suggested in the 1990s by television gardening personality Don Burke,.\n\n\n=== Breed development ===\nIn 1991 a group of enthusiasts from the state of South Australia formed the autonomous Miniature Fox Terrier Club of South Australia, separate to the Miniature Fox Terrier Club of Australia, which had been operating for some time. In 1992 they met with owners from other states to discuss the future of the Clubs. At that time, it became evident that there were differences as to the preferred type of dog that would represent the Miniature Fox Terrier breed. Further, challenges to the name \u201cMiniature Fox Terrier\u201d were being mounted, and threatened to preclude recognition by the ANKC which was a priority among some breeders. The establishment of the Tenterfield Terrier Club of Australia Inc took place in January 1993, by approximately 85% of votes returned to the ANKC by fanciers across NSW WA and SA. In 2002, the Tenterfield Terrier was recognized by the ANKC and placed in Group 2, Terriers.\nThe Tenterfield Terrier breed standard differs from that of the Miniature Fox Terrier, and although they are sometimes confused, the two breeds have been developing along divergent lines for some time and are now separate breeds.\n\n\n== Health and temperament ==\nDespite its small stature, the dog is friendly with an outgoing, adaptable nature, bold in the way of terriers and is intelligent. The coat is low maintenance for grooming purposes. Although they can live to 20 years in good health, the average lifespan is from 12 to 14 years.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMiniature Fox Terrier\nFox Terrier (Smooth)\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 478, "name": "Terceira Mastiff", "country": "Portugal", "type": "", "picture": "dog478", "description": "The Terceira Mastiff  (Portuguese: [c\u00e3o de fila da Terceira]) is a landrace Portuguese dog breed, also known as the Rabo Torto (rabo=tail, torto=curled/twisted).

It descends from local dogs, old Spanish and English mastiffs and bulldogs, the Dogue de Bordeaux and the Bloodhound. According to a legend, it once was very popular among the pirates of the region and soon became a popular fighting dog as well. In the 1880s, veterinarian Dr. Jose Leite Pacheco wrote the first breed standard and intended to make the nickname rabo torto as the official name of the breed instead of the c\u00e3o de fila da Terceira. Unfortunately, the Terceira Mastiff was already extremely endangered that time, which was one of the reasons why - despite of the Portuguese standard - it was never accepted by the FCI.\nIn the 1960s, there was an attempt to revive the breed with the aid of the Portuguese government. However, there was disagreement between government officials and breeders, which led to the project's failure. After this, the future of the Terceira Mastiff depended solely on local farmers and breed fanciers. In the 1970s, it was already declared extinct, although there were still some individuals left in the Azores. With these few individuals, the recreation of the breed finally begun.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Terceira Mastiff is a medium-sized molosser that represents the Fila or Dogo type and resembles the C\u00e3o Fila de S\u00e3o Miguel. One of its most remarkable features is an innately short, corkscrew like tail. Its nose can be either black, pink, or even brown. The colour of the short, smooth coat can be either fawn or yellow, always with a light mask. Red, brindle, and black individuals are usually considered to be unpure. The height is approximately 55 cm (22 in).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External Links ==\nC\u00e3o de Fila da Terceira (in Portuguese)"}, {"id": 479, "name": "Thai Bangkaew Dog", "country": "Thailand", "type": "", "picture": "dog479", "description": "The Thai Bangkaew Dog is an Asian dog breed.  It is a medium-sized spitz-type dog.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Thai Bangkaew Dog is compactly built and square in profile.  It is well proportioned, with a smooth gait. The double coat consists of a short undercoat, with longer guard hairs growing through it forming the outer coat. The coat is thicker and longer around the neck, chest, and back forming a lion-like ruff, which is more noticeable on male dogs than on female dogs. The plumed tail is carried with moderate upward curve over the back. The breed comes in white with shades of red, gray, brown, and black in a wide variety of patterns.There are some that have white coats.\n\n\n== History ==\nBangkaew is a village located in the Bang Rakam District, Phitsanulok Province in the central region of Thailand. In this district, near the Yom River, there is a monastery called Wat Bangkaew where it is believed that Thai Bangkaew Dogs originated.\nLegend has it that the third abbot of Bangkaew Temple, the respected Luang Puh Maak Metharee, was known for mercy and giving care to all living things. An old Bangkaew villager named Tah Nim gave the abbot a native bitch. Because she was pregnant without any dog in the area, her mating was thought to be either a golden jackal (Canis aureus) or a dhole (Cuon alpinus) living in the surrounding forest.  A chromosome study of Thai Bangkaew dog confirmed that the breed is the result of domestic dog and jackal interbreed. The resulting litter produced longhaired puppies of black and dark brown coloration. Luang Puh Maak Metharee raised the resulting puppies, four females.\nSeasonal rain produced flooding, a natural barrier that limited the dogs contributing to the gene pool. Inbreeding that took place led to the creation of the Thai Bangkaew Dogs. From then on the breed has been selectively bred and has become one of the most favored varieties of Thai dogs.\n\n\n== Health and temperament ==\nThis is an intelligent, athletic, agile and robust breed. It will be a loyal and protective family companion as well as an excellent watchdog. \nThe Thai Bangkaew Dog is a loving, intelligent and alert dog that makes an excellent and devoted family companion as well as a good working and hunting dog. This breed will be affectionate with its family, will get along well with children and a properly socialized dog will be very gentle with smaller children.\nThe Thai Bangkaew Dog is not an aggressive breed but can be aloof with strangers and is very territorial and protective. However, this breed is more likely to threaten than bite and attack. It makes a great guardian and watchdog that will loudly announce arrival of any visitor (friend or stranger).\nThe Thai Bangkaew Dog is a breed that is known to be very aggressive towards other dogs. With other animals your dog will get along well if you start socialization from a very young age. This breed is definitely for an experienced owner.\nThe Thai Bangkaew Dog is an intelligent breed, but is independent and can be stubborn. Therefore, it's not always easy to train. This breed need consistent and short training with a lot of positive methods like treats or praise. Avoid repetitive tasks, as this dog gets bored quickly.\nThe Thai Bangkaew Dog needs a confident and experienced owner who can earn the dog\u2019s trust and respect. Socialization must start from a very young age.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nFCI"}, {"id": 480, "name": "Thai Ridgeback", "country": "Thailand", "type": "Sighthound and Pariah", "picture": "dog480", "description": "The Thai Ridgeback (Thai: \u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e19, RTGS: Thai Lang-An) is an ancient landrace of dog, recently established also as a standardized breed. The breed was formerly unknown outside Thailand, but is gaining notice in the Western world. They are also known as a  Mah Thai Lang Ahn. The Thai Ridgeback is one of only three breeds that has a ridge of hair that runs along its back in the opposite direction to the rest of the coat. The other two are the Rhodesian Ridgeback and the Phu Quoc Ridgeback.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nThe Thai Ridgeback is a muscular, medium-sized pariah-type dog with a wedge-shaped head, triangular-shaped prick ears, and a very short, smooth coat. It has a pronounced ridge on its back formed by hair growing in the opposite direction that extends from behind the withers to the hips. Puppies are occasionally born ridgeless. Thai Ridgebacks have a muscular and streamlined body, making them extremely agile. The tail is carried upward called a sickle or sword tail. Its forehead wrinkles with enormous expression.  Like many eastern breeds,  the Thai Ridgeback has retained a  'scissor jaw' where upper and lower teeth interlock when the jaw bones clamp down.  The tongue can be black or have black marks.  Eyes are almond-shaped and brown but may be amber in blue dogs. The ears are set low and point slightly outward. The ears stand up progressively during the puppy growth period; they are not cropped. The back is straight and level. The coat is short, hard, and straight. Due to the length and density of the coat shedding is minimal, occurring once or twice yearly. Because this breed does not have an undercoat the hair does not usually bother people allergic to other breeds of dogs. Coat must be solid colors of blue, black, red or fawn with a black mask being acceptable on reds. However, brindle and white are also found but are not acceptable colors. For international show and competition, shoulder height should be 22-24 inches (56\u201361 cm) in males and 20-22 inches (51\u201356 cm) in females. The weight averages 35\u201355 lbs in females and 40-60 lbs in males.\nEight distinctive ridge patterns have been identified: needle, feather, arrow, lute, violin, bowling pin, leaf, and saddleback. All patterns are acceptable, but must be clearly defined and symmetrical. The broader the ridge, the more highly it is prized.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Health ==\nThai ridgebacks are a hearty, overall healthy breed with few inherent health issues. The breed has reproduced in Thailand almost exclusively by natural selection until the very recent past. The domesticated population is small. Inbreeding depression has not been observed in the breed. Thai Ridgeback Dogs are prone to dermoid sinus. Modern lines of Thai Ridgeback, resulting from interpopulation crosses, may also be prone to hip dysplasia and other genetic disorders.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThai Ridgebacks are an intelligent breed. The energy level is typically medium to high, with most of the day spent lounging and activity periods occurring in sporadic bursts. Well bred and properly socialized Thai Ridgebacks make loyal, loving family pets. They are naturally protective of their home and family and can be aggressive or shy when not properly socialized. They are best kept by consistent owners who have a thorough understanding of dog behavior. Because of prior geographic isolation and lack of human contact, the Thai Ridgeback remains independent minded and much of the original natural instinct and drives remain intact, particularly prey drive. Due to its nature, the Thai Ridgeback is not recommended for the novice dog handler. They have an excellent jumping ability and may seek to roam if not properly contained.\n\n\n== Genetics ==\n\n\n=== Ridge ===\n \n\nThe ridgeback is under a control of two groups of epistatic genes. The first determines the existence of the ridge. The other determines the size of the ridge, from none to very large (down to the side) the latter, the more the genes in the dog, the broader is the ridge. The ridge will appear only if there is at least one dominant allele in both groups.\n\n\n=== Color ===\nCoat color is also under a control of two groups of epistatic genes. The first determines the color of the coat if it should be black, brown, red or blue. The series of dominance is black to brindle to red to white. The intensity of the coat color is under control of a set of modifying genes. The other group controls the dilution of the colors. Black can be dilute to gray/silver/blue, and red will turn fawn. The normal color is dominance over the diluted.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe origin of the Thai Ridgeback is undocumented, but the breed was developed in eastern Thailand. The history of the breed is the subject of numerous hypotheses.\nThe other existing purebreeds of ridgeback dog are the Rhodesian Ridgeback from Africa and the Phu Quoc Ridgeback from Vietnam, which is somewhat smaller than the Thai Ridgeback. Based on genetic-based hypothesis, both Thai Ridgeback Dog and Phu Quoc Dog are likely to be descended from Funan Ridgeback Dog which originated over 1,000 years ago in Funan Era of the region. The descendent of the Hottentot Dog or Ari Dog (as called by the tribe), a known African ridge-bearing ancestor of the Rhodesian Ridgeback, is now found as Africanis. The gene that causes the ridge has been inherited from a common ancestor: \"The geographical origin of the ridge present in Ridgeback dogs is still a mystery, thus solid proof has now been provided that the ridge mutation in Ridgeback dogs is identical by descent and the likelihood of parallel mutations occurring in Asia and Africa (Epstein, 1937) can therefore be rejected.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nPhu Quoc Ridgeback\nRhodesian Ridgeback\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThai Ridgeback at Curlie"}, {"id": 481, "name": "Tibetan Mastiff", "country": "Tibet", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog481", "description": "The Tibetan Mastiff is a large Tibetan dog breed (Canis lupus familiaris) (Tibetan: \u0f51\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f41\u0fb1\u0f72, Chinese: \u85cf\u7352; Pinyin: Z\u00e0ng \u00e1o) in the mastiff family. Originating with the nomadic cultures of Tibet, China, Pakistan, India, Mongolia and Nepal, it is used by local tribes of Tibetans to protect sheep from wolves, leopards, bears, large mustelids, and tigers.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\n\nThe Tibetan Mastiff known as Drog-Khyi (\u0f60\u0f56\u0fb2\u0f7c\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f41\u0fb1\u0f72) in Tibetan, which means \"nomad dog\", (\"dog which may be tied\", \"dog which may be kept\"), reflects its use as a guardian of herds, flocks, tents, villages, monasteries, and palaces, much as the old English ban-dog (also meaning tied dog) was a dog tied outside the home as a guardian. However, in nomad camps and in villages, the Drog-Khyi is traditionally allowed to run loose at night. This dog is known for its loyalty, it has been used as nomad dog by for thousands of years.The guardian type from which the modern Tibetan Mastiff breed has been derived was known across the ancient world by many names. Bhote Kukur in Nepali as bhote means someone from Tibet and kukur means dog. The Chinese name for the breed is \u85cf\u7352 (Chinese: Z\u00e0ng \u00e1o; Cantonese: Tzong ngou), meaning \"Tibetan Mastiff-dog\". In Mongolia, a similar looking dog it is called \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0445\u0430\u0440 (bankhar), but this dog is genetically distinct (different Traditional Native Landrace Breed) and is of a more ancient linage..\n\nThe name Tibetan Mastiff is a misnomer; the Tibetan Mastiff itself is not a true Mastiff. The term \"mastiff\" was used by the Europeans who first came to Tibet because it was used to refer to nearly all large dog breeds in the West. Early Western visitors to Tibet misnamed several of its breeds: The \"Tibetan Terrier\" is not a terrier and the \"Tibetan Spaniel\" is not a spaniel. A better name for the dog might be Tibetan mountain dog or, to encompass the landrace breed throughout its range, Himalayan mountain dog.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nSome breeders differentiate between two \"types\" of Tibetan Mastiff, the Do-khyi and the Tsang-khyi. The Tsang-khyi (which, to a Tibetan, means only \"dog from Tsang\") is also referred to as the \"monastery\" type, described as generally taller, heavier, and more heavily boned, with more facial wrinkling and haw than the Do-khyi or \"nomad\" type. Both types are often produced in the same litter with the larger, heavier pups being placed in more stationary jobs versus more active jobs for the Tibetan Mastiffs that are better structured and well-muscled.\nMales can reach heights up to 83 cm (33 in). The original Tibetan mastiff breed from its native range usually weighed 55\u201390 kg (121\u2013198 lb). The enormous dogs being produced in some Western and Chinese kennels, which sometimes weigh in excess of 115 kg (254 lb) would have cost too much to keep fed to have been useful to nomads; and their questionable structure would have made them less useful as livestock or property guardians.\nThe Tibetan Mastiff is considered a primitive breed. It typically retains the hardiness which would be required for it to survive in Tibet and the high-altitude Himalayan range, including the northern part of Nepal, India and Bhutan.\nInstinctive behaviors including canine pack behavior contributed to the survival of the breed in harsh environments. It is one of the few primitive dog breeds that retains a single estrus per year instead of two, even at much lower altitudes and in much more temperate climates than its native climate. This characteristic is also found in wild canids such as the wolf and other wild animals. Since its estrus usually takes place during late fall, most Tibetan Mastiff puppies are born between December and January.Its double coat is long, subject to climate, and found in a wide variety of colors, including solid black, black and tan, various shades of red (from pale gold to deep red) and bluish-gray (dilute black), often with white markings. Some breeders are now (2014) marketing white Tibetan Mastiffs. These dogs are actually very pale gold, not truly white. Photoshop is often used to make dogs of normal color(s) appear white in advertisements.\nThe coat of a Tibetan Mastiff lacks the unpleasant big-dog smell that affects many large breeds. The coat, whatever its length or color(s), should shed dirt and odors. Although the dogs shed somewhat throughout the year, there is generally one great molt in late winter or early spring and sometimes another, lesser molt in the late summer or early fall. (Sterilization of the dog may dramatically affect the coat as to texture, density, and shedding pattern.)\nTibetan Mastiffs are shown under one standard in the West, but separated by the Indian breed standard into two varieties: Lion Head (smaller; exceptionally long hair from forehead to withers, creating a ruff or mane) and Tiger Head (larger; shorter hair).\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nAs a flock guardian dog in Tibet and in the West, it uses all the usual livestock guardian tactics (e.g., barking, scent-marking perimeters) to warn away predators and avoid direct confrontations.As a socialized, more domestic dog, it can thrive in a spacious, fenced yard with a canine companion, but it is generally not an appropriate dog for apartment living. The Western-bred dogs are generally more easy-going, although somewhat aloof with strangers coming to the home. Through hundreds of years of selective breeding for a protective flock and family guardian, the breed has been prized for being a nocturnal sentry, keeping would-be predators and intruders at bay, barking at sounds throughout the night. Leaving a Tibetan Mastiff outside all night with neighbors nearby is not recommended. They often sleep during the day, making them more active, alert and aware at night.Like all flock guardian breeds, they are intelligent and stubborn to a fault, so obedience training is recommended (although it is only mildly successful with some individuals) since this is a strong-willed, powerful breed. Unless they are to be used exclusively as livestock guardians, socialization obedience training is also critical with this breed because of their reserved nature with strangers and guardian instincts. They can be excellent family dogs depending on the family. Owners must understand canine psychology and be willing and able to assume the primary leadership position. Lack of consistent, rational discipline can result in the creation of dangerous, unpredictable dogs. The protectiveness of Tibetan Mastiffs requires alertness and planning by the owner in order to avoid mishaps when the dog is simply performing as a guardian. The breed is not recommended for novice dog owners.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nMany breeders claim a life expectancy of 10\u201316 years but these claims are unsubstantiated. Some lines do produce long-lived dogs. Other, more closely inbred lines, produce short-lived, unhealthy dogs. The breed has fewer genetic health problems than many breeds, but cases can be found of hypothyroidism, entropion, ectropion, distichiasis, skin problems including allergies, autoimmune problems including demodex, Addison's disease, Cushing's disease, missing teeth, malocclusion (overbite, underbite, wry mouth), cardiac problems, seizures, epilepsy, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), cataract, and small ear canals with a tendency for infection. As with most large breeds, some will suffer with elbow or hip dysplasia.\nCanine inherited demyelinative neuropathy (CIDN), an inherited condition, appeared in one of the prominent lines of Tibetan Mastiffs in the early 1980s. Unfortunately, known carriers were bred extensively and are behind many lines still being actively bred. Because the mode of inheritance appears to be as a simple recessive, continued inbreeding can still produce affected puppies.\nHypothyroidism is fairly common in Tibetan Mastiffs, as it is in many large \"northern\" breeds. They should be tested periodically throughout their lives using a complete thyroid \"panel\". However, because the standard thyroid levels were established using domestic dog breeds, test results must be considered in the context of what is \"normal\" for the breed, not what is normal across all breeds. Many dogs of this breed will have \"low\" thyroid values but no clinical symptoms. Vets and owners differ on the relative merits of medicating dogs which test \"low\", but are completely asymptomatic. Some researchers think that asymptomatic hypothyroidism may have been adaptive in the regions of origin for many breeds, since less nutrition is required for the dog to stay in good condition. Therefore, attempts to eliminate \"low thyroid\" dogs from the Tibetan Mastiff gene pool may have unintended consequences for the breed.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 2008, a mitogenome study concluded that while 12 dog breeds studied appeared to have diverged from the gray wolf 42,000 years ago, the Tibetan Mastiff lineage diverged earlier at 58,000 years ago. In 2011, a further study by the same authors concluded that there was a genetic relationship between the Tibetan Mastiff and the Great Pyrenees, Bernese mountain dog, Rottweiler and Saint Bernard, and that these large breed dogs are probably partially descended from the Tibetan Mastiff. In 2014, a study added the Leonberger to the list of possible relatives. In 2016, a study looked at how the Tibetan mastiff was able to adapt to the extreme highland conditions of the Tibetan Plateau very quickly compared to other mammals such as the yak, Tibetan antelope, snow leopard, and the wild boar. The study indicated that the Tibetan mastiff's ability to avoid hypoxia in high altitudes, due to its higher hemoglobin levels compared to low-altitude dogs, was due to prehistoric interbreeding with Tibetan wolves.\nIn 1872, one writer has stated:The dogs of Thibet are twice the size of those seen in India, with large heads and hairy bodies. They are powerful animals, and are said to be able to kill a tiger. During the day they are kept chained up, and are let loose at night to guard their masters' house. In the early 20th century, King George V introduced a pair of Tibetan Mastiffs, and enough of the breed were available in England in 1906 to be shown at the Crystal Palace show. However, during the war years, the breed lost favor and focus and nearly died out in England.\nAfter 1980, the breed began to gain in popularity worldwide. Although the breed is still considered somewhat uncommon, as more active breeders arose and produced adequate numbers of dogs, various registries and show organizations (FCI, AKC) began to recognize the breed.\n\nSince AKC recognition, the number of active breeders has skyrocketed, leading to over-production of puppies, many of which are highly inbred and of questionable quality. Initially, the breed suffered because of the limited gene pool from the original stock, but today's reputable breeders work hard at reducing the genetic problems through selective breeding and the international exchange of new bloodlines. However, some few breeders cling to the practice of inbreeding, do not perform health tests on their breeding stock, and do not support buyers of the puppies they produce. Many puppies and adult dogs end up in shelters and in rescue situations.\nIn 2008, the Tibetan Mastiff competed for the first time in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.\nA Chinese woman was reported to have spent more than 4 million yuan to buy an 18-month-old purebred male Tibetan Mastiff, which she named Yangtze No. 2. In March 2011, a red Tibetan Mastiff was reported to have been sold to a 'coal baron' from northern China for 10 million yuan. There have been other similar reports of dogs sold for astronomical prices; however, most of these appear to be breeders' attempts to drive up the prices of their dogs. Photos of dogs shown on web sites are frequently photoshopped to exaggerate color intensity, size, and \"bone\". By 2015, due to copious production by breeders and unsuitability of the breed as a pet in urban situations, prices in China for the best dogs had fallen to about $2,000 and lower quality and cross-breed dogs were being abandoned.In 2013, a zoo in Louhe, China attempted to pass of a Tibetan Mastiff as an African lion.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nA Tibetan Mastiff named \u201cMax\u201d is the central antagonist in the 1993 horror film, Man's Best Friend. At least five different dogs were used in filming.\nA Tibetan Mastiff is the subject of the 2011 animated film The Tibetan Dog.\nA Tibetan Mastiff by the name of Mouse is the canine companion of the titular character of the Dresden Files book series.\nThe animated film Rock Dog featured two Tibetan Mastiffs named \u201cBodi\u201d and \u201cKhampa\u201d (voiced by Luke Wilson and J. K. Simmons).\nIn the 2018 animated television series, Craig of the Creek, the character Wildernessa rides a Tibetan Mastiff, Cheesesticks.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDog of Osu\nTibetan kyi apso\nLhasa Apso\nTibetan Spaniel\nTibetan terrier\nIndex of Tibet-related articles\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAlderton, David (1984).

They share ancestry with the Pekingese, Japanese Chin, Shih Tzu, Lhasa Apso, Tibetan Terrier and Pug. \nThis breed is not a spaniel; in the original meaning of the term; its breeding and role differs from other spaniels and spaniels are gun dogs. The spaniel name may have been given due to its resemblance to the bred-down lapdog versions of the hunting spaniels, such as the Cavalier King Charles spaniel.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Tibetan Spaniel has a domed head that is small, in comparison to its body. It has a short blunt muzzle, free of wrinkles. Their teeth occlude in either an underbite or an end-to-end bite. The nose is black. The eyes are medium in size, set wide apart and are oval in shape. The Tibetan Spaniel does not have extra skin around the eyes; this helps to distinguish the breed from the Pekingese. The ears hang down either side of the head to cheek level and are feathered with a v shape. The neck is covered in a mane of hair, which is more noticeable in the male of the breed. The Tibetan Spaniel's front legs are a little bowed and the feet are \"hare-like\". This dog has a great feathered tail that is set high and is carried over their back. The coat is a silky double coat lying flat and is short and smooth on the face and leg fronts; it is medium in length on the body; it has feathering on the ears, toes and tail. \nTibetan Spaniels come in all colours and be solid, shaded and multi-coloured. Colours that are seen are red, fawn, gold, white, cream, black and tan, and parti. Often there are white markings on the feet. \nBy AKC breed standard, this breed grows to about 10 in (25 cm) at the shoulder, and the weight is 9\u201315 lb (4.1\u20136.8 kg). Slightly larger Tibetan Spaniels can often be found outside the show ring.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nExtremely intelligent, the Tibetan Spaniel is one of the most cat-like dog breeds. They will climb on the sofa, table, dresser, etc., to see what is going on outside. At the same time, they are highly affectionate and will often greet their owners by jumping into their lap and licking their face.Tibetan Spaniels are a social breed that needs regular contact with their humans. They do not respond well to being left alone for long periods of time. Having been developed as a companion dog by Tibetan monks they are emotional and empathetic to the needs of their owners. \nIt is important to socialize Tibetan Spaniels at an early age to a variety of people and situations. They are protective of their family. Even after socialization, they are typically aloof with strangers. If startled or uneasy, a Tibetan Spaniel will express their distrust with loud alarm barking. \nWhile utterly devoted to their family members, Tibetan Spaniels are fiercely independent with a tendency to wander off and explore rather than come when called. This quality - assertive, independent, and alert - is the standard temperament required by both the AKC and FCI breed standards.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Tibet ===\nSmall monastery dogs, thought to be early representatives of the Tibetan Spaniel, loyally trailed behind their Lama masters and came to be regarded as \"little Lions\" owing to their resemblance to the Chinese guardian lions that gave them great value and prestige. The practice of sending the dogs as gifts to the palaces of China and other Buddhist countries grew significantly, and more \"lion dogs\" were presented back to Tibet, continuing until as late as 1908. As a result of exchanges of Tibetan Spaniels between palaces and monasteries, the breed is likely to have common ancestors with Oriental breeds such as the Japanese Chin and the Pekingese. \nNot only was the Tibetan Spaniel prized as a pet and companion, but it was also a useful member of Tibetan monastic life. The little dogs would sit on the monastery walls, keeping watch over the countryside. Their keen eyesight and ability to see great distances made them excellent watchdogs. They would alarm bark to alert the monks and the Tibetan Mastiffs below. In addition to functioning as lookouts, the Tibetan Spaniels were trained to spin the monk's prayer wheels. They also slept with the monks at night to provide warmth.Village-bred Tibetan Spaniels varied greatly in size and type, and the smaller puppies were usually given as gifts to the monasteries. In turn, these smaller dogs used in the monastery breeding programs were probably combined with the more elegant Tibetan Spaniel-type dogs brought from China. Those bred closer to the Chinese borders were characterized by shorter snouts.\n\n\n=== Western World ===\nTibetan Spaniels were being bred in the United Kingdom by the 1890s. The first authenticated reference we find to Tibetan Spaniels in the United States is a litter born out of two imported dogs from a Tibetan monastery in 1965. In January 1971, the Tibetan Spaniel Club of America was formed with 14 charter members. An open secondary registry was maintained. After a period in the Miscellaneous classes, the Tibetan Spaniel was accepted for AKC registration and became eligible to compete as a Non-Sporting breed, effective January 1, 1984. The breed was recognized by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in 1987 and placed in Group 9 Companion and Toy Dogs, Section 5 : Tibetan breeds.\n\n\n=== Genetic History ===\nProfessor Ludvic von Schulmuth studied the origins of skeletal remains of dogs in human settlements as old as ten thousand years. The Professor created a genealogical tree of Tibetan dogs. It shows that the Gobi Desert Kitchen Midden Dog, a small scavenger, evolved into the Small Soft-Coated Drop-Eared Hunting Dog which then evolved into the Tibetan Spaniel, Pekingese, and Japanese Chin.  Intermixing of the Tibetan Spaniel with the Tibetan breeds Lhasa Apso and Shih Tzu resulted in both the latter breeds birthing the occasional \"Prapso\", a pup with a shedding coat closely resembling the Tibetan Spaniel.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe Tibetan Spaniel is a generally healthy dog with a life expectancy of 13\u201316 years.\n\n\n=== Progressive retinal atrophy ===\n\nProgressive retinal atrophy is a genetic disease that can occur in the breed. The disease is an inherited form of blindness in dogs that has in two forms: generalized PRA and central PRA. Generalized PRA is primarily a photoreceptor disease and is the form found in Tibetan Spaniels. The clinical signs have been observed between 1\u00bd and 4 years, but as late at seven years. The disease is painless and affected dogs become completely blind. Currently there is no treatment, but affected dogs generally adapt well to their progressive blindness.\nThe earliest clinical sign of progressive retinal atrophy is \"night blindness.\" The dog cannot see well in a dimly lit room or at dusk. The dog will show a reluctance to move from a lighted area into darker surroundings. The night blindness develops progressively into complete blindness. The British institution Animal Health Trust (AHT) devoted intensive research for PRA in Tibetan Spaniels, isolating the responsible gene.  The mutation was identified by Louise Downs, as part of her PhD studies.  A DNA test based on this mutation became available July 8, 2013.\nResponsible breeders are working hard to eliminate PRA within the breed. Currently, the International Tibetan Spaniel Working Party collects health data including PRA history.\n\n\n=== Portosystemic shunt ===\n\nA portosystemic shunt is an abnormal vessel that allows blood to bypass the liver, one of the body's filters, so that it is not cleansed. This rare condition in Tibetan Spaniels is often referred to as a \"liver shunt\".\nMost shunts cause recognizable symptoms by the time a dog is a young adult but are occasionally diagnosed only later in life. Since the severity of the condition can vary widely depending on how much blood flow is diverted past the liver it is possible for a lot of variation in clinical signs and time of onset. Often, this condition is recognized after a puppy fails to grow, allowing early diagnosis. Signs of portosystemic shunts include poor weight gain, sensitivity to sedatives (especially diazepam), depression, pushing the head against a solid object, seizures, weakness, salivation, vomiting, poor appetite, increased drinking and urinating, balance problems and frequent urinary tract disease or early onset of bladder stones. A dramatic increase of these signs after eating is a strong supportive sign of a portosystemic shunt.\n\n\n=== Other issues ===\nLike many breeds of dog, Tibetan Spaniels are susceptible to allergies. They can also experience cherry eye, a prolapsed third eyelid. Additionally, the shape of a Tibetan Spaniel's face makes it prone to a common cosmetic condition called weeping eye.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCompanion dog\nCompanion Dog Group\nToy Group\nNon-Sporting Group\nUtility Group\nIndex of Tibet-related articles\nFoo Dog, dog breeds originating in China that resemble Chinese guardian lions and hence are also called Foo or Fu Dogs or Lion Dogs.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTibetan spaniel at Curlie"}, {"id": 483, "name": "Tibetan Terrier", "country": "Tibet", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog483", "description": "The Tibetan Terrier is a medium-size breed of dog that originated in Tibet. Despite its name, it is not a member of the terrier group. The breed was given its English name by European travelers due to its resemblance to known terrier breeds. The Tibetan name for the breed, Tsang Apso, roughly translates to \"shaggy or bearded (\"apso\") dog, from the province of Tsang\". Some old travelers' accounts refer to the dog as Dokhi Apso or \"outdoor\" Apso, indicating a shaggy or bearded working dog which lives outdoors.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of the Tibetan Terrier dates back thousands of years. Tibetan Terriers were kept as good luck charms, mascots, watchdogs, herding dogs, and companions. They were also used to retrieve articles that fell down mountain sides.Also known as the \"Holy Dogs of Tibet,\" Tibetan Terriers were never sold, only given as gifts by monks to promote good fortune. As such, the early history of the breed is linked to only a handful of foundation dogs. Recent DNA analysis has concluded that the Tibetan Terrier is descended from the most ancient dog breeds.Due in part to Tibet's geographical isolation, Tibetan Terriers were kept purebred for over 2000 years. Monks and families referred to the ancient breed as \"the little people\", for they were highly valued as companions who were eager to assist in protecting properties and flocks. Since the dog was considered a bringer of luck, mistreating or selling a Tibetan Terrier was believed to cause bad luck to both family and village alike.\nDr. A.R.H. Greig of England brought the first Tibetan Terrier to Europe in 1922. She was given a gold and white female puppy named \"Bunti\" after successfully performing an operation on a patient in Tibet. After acquiring a second male, \"Rajah,\" Dr. Greig established a kennel and began to breed them.\nThe first litter was born in 1924 and were registered as Lhasa Terriers. In 1930, the Kennel Club of India changed the breed's name to Tibetan Terrier. The first Tibetan Terriers in the US were imported in 1956 by Dr. Henry and Mrs. Alice Murphy of Great Falls, Virginia. In 1973, the American Kennel Club recognized the breed, classifying it as part of the non-sporting group.Tibetan Terriers are related to and have contributed to the development of other breeds, including the Shih Tzu, Lhasa Apso, Tibetan Spaniel, Polish Lowland Sheepdog, among others.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Tibetan Terrier is a powerful, medium-sized dog of square proportions, with a shaggy coat. They vary widely in height and weight, ranging from 14\u201316 in (35\u201341 cm) and is 18\u201330 lb (8\u201314 kg), with 20\u201324 lb (9.5\u201311 kg) preferred for either sex. All weights are acceptable if in proportion to the size. Fully grown, the Tibetan Terrier resembles a miniaturized Bearded Collie. The head is moderate, with a strong muzzle of medium length, and a skull neither rounded nor flat. The eyes are large, dark, and set fairly far apart. The V-shaped drop ears are well-feathered, and should be set high on the sides of the skull. Although the preferred colour for the nose is black, in showdogs, they are also sometimes brown. The body is well-muscled and compact. The length of the back should be equal to the height at the withers, giving the breed its typical square look. The tail is set high, well-feathered, and carried in a curl over the back. One of the more unusual features of the Tibetan Terrier is their broad, flat feet with hair between the toes, which are ideal for climbing mountains, acting as natural snow shoes.\nThe hair of the Tibetan Terrier has a long growth cycle. As a result, their coat grows quite long and pet animals will require occasional trimming. They do not shed like dogs with shorter hair growth cycles, but rather slough hair at a rate similar to that of most humans. The exception is at approximately nine months when puppies slough their entire coat in advance of acquiring their adult coat. The double coat is profuse, with a warm undercoat and a topcoat which has the texture of human hair. It should not be silky or curled, but wavy is acceptable. Long and thick, it is shown natural, but should not be so long as to touch the floor, as is typical in breeds such as the Lhasa Apso or Maltese. A fall of hair covers the face and eyes, but long eyelashes generally prevent hair from getting in the Tibetan Terrier's eyes, and the breed has very good eyesight.\nThe coat of the Tibetan Terrier requires regular and careful grooming to keep tangles from forming. This coat helps the Tibetan Terrier withstand temperatures as low as \u221250 \u00b0C for prolonged periods of time.\nAll colours are permissible, barring liver and chocolate, and none is preferred. Gold is the rarest. Tibetan Terriers are available in any combination of solid, parti-color, tricolor, brindle, or piebald, as long as the nose leather is black and the eyes and eye rims are dark.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe temperament has been one of the most attractive aspects of the breed since it was first established. They are amiable and affectionate family dogs, sensitive to their owners, and gentle with older children if properly introduced. As is fitting for a dog with origins as a watch dog, Tibetans tend to be reserved around strangers, but should never be aggressive nor shy with them. Though not prone to excessive barking, the Tibetan Terrier has an assertive bark.\nSuitable for apartment living, the Tibetan is an energetic and strong dog, and needs regular exercise. The energy level of the Tibetan is moderate to high and its general nature is happy, active, lively, intelligent, and agile. As a result, they are well suited for dog sports such as agility. They are steadfast, determined, and clever, which can lead to them being stubborn. Tibetan Terriers are usually charming and loyal. Some dogs of this breed can often be guarding of their resources, which can make it hard to live with another pet. Tibetan Terriers are the perfect dog for an easy and relaxed life style with regular exercise involved.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe Tibetan Terrier can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, rally obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and even herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Tibetan Terriers that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== Health ==\nA UK Kennel Club survey puts the average lifespan of the breed at 12 years. About one in five lives to 15 years or more, with the longest-lived Tibetan Terrier having lived to 18.25 years.  \nThough an athletic breed that has been bred for a natural look, the Tibetan Terrier is nonetheless susceptible to a variety of health problems, especially those related to the eyes and joints. These problems can include canine hip dysplasia, luxating patella, progressive retinal atrophy, lens luxation, cataracts and heart murmurs. Tibetans also have a history of being somewhat allergic to dairy, wheat and grains. Because of these potential health conditions Tibetan Terrier clubs recommend purchasing from breeders who participate in eye and hip testing, such as the Canine Eye Registration Foundation (CERF) and Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA).\nIn addition, Tibetan Terriers can carry the genetic disease canine neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, called Batten disease in humans. The first symptom of the disease is night blindness. Blindness and neurological signs such as epilepsy, motor abnormalities, dementia, and unexpected aggression will follow some years later. The gene responsible for the disease in Tibetan Terriers was identified in 2009 and there is now a DNA test for it. A German study showed that about 1/3 of Tibetan Terriers are carriers, but no affected dogs has been produced since the introduction of the DNA test as the German breed club requirements forbid carriers from being bred together.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDog of Osu\nTibetan dog breeds\nTibetan kyi apso\nLhasa Apso\nTibetan Mastiff\nTibetan Spaniel\nIndex of Tibet-related articlesCompanion dog\nIndex of Tibet-related articles\nCompanion Dog Group\nUtility Group\nNon-Sporting Group\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTibetan Terrier at Curlie"}, {"id": 484, "name": "Tornjak", "country": "Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog484", "description": "The Tornjak (pronunciation is \"tornyak\"; official original name), also known as Bosnian and Herzegovinian \u2013 Croatian Shepherd dog (official English name), is a mountain sheep dog native to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. It is considered that 11th and 14th-century documents mention the breed. It became almost extinct, but the salvation started in the early 1970s with pure blood breeding since 1978. FCI accepted it on a provisional basis in 2007, and on definitive basis with official valid standard on 7 November 2017, placed in \"Group 2, Section 2 : Molossoid Breeds\", with \"Nr. 355\" in \"Section 2.2\" dedicated to the Mountain Types.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTornjaks belong to the rare livestock protection breeds and share many characteristics with other Mountain dogs. The Tornjak is one of the very old breeds from ancient times, and it was mentioned in handwritten papers for the first time in the 9th century, in the documents of the Catholic Church. The breed was later mentioned in the 11th and 14th century. Descriptions of the Tornjak were found in the writings of Peter Horvat, bishop of \u0110akovo, Croatia, which date back to the year 1374, those descriptions were also found in the writings of Peter Luki\u0107, Canon of the \u0110akovo diocese, which were written in 1752. The term 'Tornjak' evolved from the Bosnian/Croatian word \"tor\", which means an enclosed area where the sheep live in. To this day, these dogs are called Tora\u0161i (Torashi) in the surroundings of the city of Sinj and on the Kame\u0161nica mountain, whereas the shepherds of the Dinara-mountains call them Dinarci. Descriptions of Tornjaks from these documents are the very same as they are today, except for the name of the breed, which was Bosanski Ov\u010dar, meaning Bosnian Shepherd Dog. It was also called the Hrvatski pas planinac, meaning Croatian mountain dog. The dogs in these documents were described entirely equal (in respect to their function and their appearance) as they are today: a protective guarding dog which keeps and watches all that their owners ask them, but is highly intelligent and selectively bred to be without excessive aggression. They are also pleasant toward strangers that they meet outside of their domain.\nIt is considered that the dogs of the Tornjak's type have existed in the area around and in Dinarides (Dinaric Alps), especially in the region around Vla\u0161i\u0107 (close to the city of Travnik, Bosnia and Herzegovina) as a central area of the region since the Roman times. The Romans used their dogs for war and as guardian dogs, as well as for fighting in the arena. Although the Tornjak is a very old breed, with the vanishing of nomadic sheep herding, the Tornjak also gradually vanished. In the early 1970s, a group of local cynologists began to collect the remaining dogs which best corresponded to the old writings about the breed. Tornjaks were first imported to the UK in 2013 with intentions of working towards UK Kennel Club Recognition.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nTornjaks are large and powerful dogs, with well proportioned, almost square-bodied features and agile movements. The dog's bones are not light, but nevertheless not heavy nor coarse. They have a long and thick double coat with a thick undercoat. The bodies of these dogs are strong and well built, with harmonious and dignified movements. The dogs have long and thick hair and this adequately protects them against poor weather conditions. The dogs typically possess shaggy tails, kept high like a flag. Tornjaks have a clear, self-confident, serious and calm disposition. In general the Tornjak is a long-coated dog with short hair over the face and legs. The topcoat is long, thick, coarse and straight. It is especially long on the upper part of the croup; over the shoulders and the back it can be slightly wavy. On the muzzle and the forehead, up to the imaginary line connecting the ears, over the ears. On the front parts of the legs and feet it is short. It is especially abundant around the neck (mane), dense and long over the upper thighs (breeches). It forms feathers along the forearms. With well-coated dogs it is also especially abundant on the rear of hind pasterns.\nTornjaks can be either solid colored or parti-colored, usually the color white predominates. The color of Tornjaks is unrestricted, all colors are accepted. It ranges from nearly completely white to almost black with yellow, red, brown and not-quite-desired gray in between. There are two main types: piebald and Irish spotting. Originally, the goal was to breed varying colors and patterns so shepherds could distinguish their dogs easily from a distance. Breeders also strive towards distinction compared to other breeds.\n\nHead\nLupine, wedge-shaped and elongated. Due to the heavy coat it sometimes looks too small. Powerful and long jaws, teeth complete, scissor bite. The back of the muzzle is straight. The zygomatic arches above the eyes may be slightly noticeable. Back of skull is elongated but not narrow, straight from zygomatic arches to occiput. The top of the muzzle is straight, proportional, never pointed or excessively fleshy, lips fitted tightly to the jaws. Almond shaped eyes, eyelids close to the skull. Large ears, that are single turned downwards, set high up nearer to the vertex than in other sheepdogs breeds.Neck\nLong, carried low, set at 45 degrees when alert. Neck muscles firm and taut. Skin thick especially at the nape of the neck and adheres to the inner tissue not only on the upper but also on the lower side of the neck. Covered with a rich crop of long hair (ruff).\nBack\nRelatively short, firm, moderately wide and level.Tail\nLong, can be saber-shaped, annular or hooked (slight upward turn at the tip), set medium high. Highly mobile, at rest hanging downwards. When in motion - trotting - or when alert or excited, always carried above the back.Chest\nVery broad, conically deep, wide and rounded, but ribs not heavy. The breast is well-proportioned and forms a firmly connected unit between shoulder joint and chest. As a rule, the sternum (breast bone) tip is a little below the shoulder joint.Belly\nFirm muscles, continuous lower line, moderately tucked-up from the back end of sternum to the inside of loins.Coat\nAs a rule, long-coated with short hair on face and front part of legs. Top coat is long, hard-textured (similar to goats) and straight. On the front part of shoulders and backside of rump it can be slightly wavy. Particularly well developed on the neck and also very rich and long below the tail, forming trousers. Feathering on the forearm and very rich feathering on the tail. Upper hair is especially long on the upper rump just before tail set. Firmly closed and not able to be opened in parting.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nTornjak has a calm temperament. A typical adult Tornjak is very calm, peaceful, at first sight an indifferent animal, but when the situation demands it, it is a vigilant and very alert watchdog. The character is equal to the temperament; they are not nervous nor aggressive.  In general, they are very tough, not too demanding, sturdy dogs. With their human family they are very emotional. When living in a pack they are highly social animals and there isn't any fighting between the pack members. Towards strangers or other animals, as a rule, Tornjak is not overly aggressive. But when the situation calls upon it, Tornjak is quite decisive and it can without any consideration attack even much stronger rivals. Shepherds used to say that a Tornjak who guards the flock is a fair match to two wolves, and a couple will confront and chase away a bear without any undue respect. In these situations Tornjaks are very tenacious.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nTornjak's exercise levels are usually not demanding, especially in the first 9\u201312 months (during the last intensive growth period). After that they can exercise as much as possible. They prefer long walks without a leash and a lot of playing with other dogs. They will also be just as satisfied with only a 20 minute walk if its owner is in a hurry. Tornjaks learn quickly and do not forget easily; they happily perform tasks and are therefore easy to train. Strong and hardy, during the snowy winter nights, these dogs lie on the ground and often get covered with snow without freezing due to their thick coats or as the locals would say it 'MRAZ PO NJEM PADA'. They are primarily used for herding and protection of livestock.\n\n\n== Care ==\nTornjak is not recommended for apartment life. They need space and will do best with at least a large yard. Because its thick coat protects it so well it can happily cope with living outdoors provided it has proper shelter. This breed is best suited to a family with lots of space surrounding the home where it can attend to its own exercise needs.\nTornjak is a very healthy breed, but because they were very poorly fed in their past, they now do not need much protein in their food. For feeding Tornjaks a low protein diet is suitable. A high protein diet can lead to the development of coat problems. Climbing up and down stairs the first six months can ruin hock joints or lead to hip dysplasia (canine).\nTornjak needs early socialization. Early experiences (before 9 months of age) has a very significant effect throughout the dog's life. They need to be confronted with all potentially fearful stimuli as early as possible in order to avoid later fear reactions.  Traffic noise, big trucks and buses will provoke fear reactions in adulthood if the Tornjak has not previously faced these situations as a puppy. In this early age all Tornjak puppies have to meet as many unknown people as possible, and also other animals, dogs, and pets especially, for developing a good and stable behavior as an adult.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTornjak Bosnian-Herzegovinian website\nTornjak online pedigree database\nTornjak UK website"}, {"id": 485, "name": "Tosa (dog)", "country": "Japan", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog485", "description": "The Tosa (\u571f\u4f50, also called the Tosa Inu, Tosa-Ken or Japanese Mastiff) is a breed of dog of Japanese origin that is considered rare. It was originally bred in Tosa, Shikoku (present day K\u014dchi) as a fighting dog and is the only breed still used (legally) in Japanese dog fighting. Ownership is restricted in some countries as a dangerous breed.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Tosa varies considerably in size, with the Japanese-bred dogs tending to be about half the size of those bred outside the country. The Japanese breed generally weighs between 36 and 61 kilograms (80 and 135 lb), while the non-Japanese breeders have focused on dogs that weigh from 60 to 90 kg (130 to 200 lb) and stand 62 to 82 cm (24 to 32 in) at the withers.[1] The coat is characterized by its short and smooth appearance and is often red, brindle, fawn or occasionally it can be a dull black. Maintenance of the coat is usually minimal.  Dogs can occasionally tip the scale at 91 kilograms (200 lb).  In Japan they are considered the equivalent of Sumo wrestlers, and are even depicted in wrestling accoutrement.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThis breed originated in the second half of the nineteenth century. The breed started from the native Shikoku-Inu (an indigenous dog weighing about 25 kilograms (45 pounds) and standing about 55 centimetres high). These dogs were crossed with European dog breeds, such as the Old English Bulldog in 1872, Mastiff in 1874, St. Bernard, German Pointer in 1876,  Great Dane in 1924, and the Bull Terrier.[2] The aim was to breed a larger, more powerful dog. The heyday of Tosa breeding was between 1924 and 1933, when it was said that there were more than 5,000 Tosa breeders in Japan.\n\n\n== Legal matters ==\n\nOwnership of Tosas is legally restricted in certain jurisdictions. In the United Kingdom ownership is regulated under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, and in Trinidad & Tobago under the Dog Control Act 2014. A specific exemption of a British court is required to own and import Tosas legally in the UK.The breed is banned or legally restricted at a national level in:\n\nAustralia\nDenmark\nFiji\nIceland\nRepublic of Ireland\nMalaysia\nMalta\nNew Zealand\nNorway\nSingapore\nTunisia\nUnited Kingdom\nRomania\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of dog fighting breeds\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nFogle, Bruce (2000).

Breeders were working in two different directions to create this breed. One was to downsize the Bulldog. This was not very successful due to complications with breeding sub-regular size dogs of this breed together. The dwarf size Bulldog puppies were and still are occasionally born out of regular size parents, but they were neither the healthiest, nor the most fertile dogs. They often produced regular-size puppies. Thus, this version of the breed had never been established. \nAnother attempt of creating the Toy Bulldog was via crossbreeding  French Bulldogs,  English Bulldog, and their offspring to decrease the weight to a desirable 20 pounds or so. There were several dogs, and the breed was presented by \"The French Toy Bulldog Club of England\" to the Kennel Club. However, this version of the breed had not been developed to the point of recognition as well. English breeders and Kennel Club representatives refused to call a mixed breed dog a Bulldog.Nowadays the term \"Toy Bulldog\" is occasionally used to describe a small variety of another cross known as a \"Miniature Bulldog\".  This is not an established breed, but a hybrid, resulting from crossbreeding English Bulldogs, Pugs and/or their offspring.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 487, "name": "Toy Fox Terrier", "country": "United States", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog487", "description": "The Toy Fox Terrier is a small terrier breed of dog, directly descended from the larger Fox Terrier but considered a separate breed.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nToy Fox Terriers are small dogs with a muscular and athletic appearance. Notable characteristic traits include a short glossy and predominantly white coat, coupled with a predominantly solid head, and a short, high-set tail. The breed has been deemed elegant and graceful with V-shaped ears and large eyes. The tail can be short and straight or long and shiny, and breeders often shorten the tail a few days after birth by clipping it about three-fifth of the way from the tip (at the third or fourth joint). The coat is short, fine, and glossy in black  with tan, with areas of tan on the face; there are two other variants, one with 'chocolate' replacing the black in areas (the UKC does not allow this variant to be shown), another which is all white with tan and no black at all, and one which is white with black markings and no tan accents. These variants are often known as 'Tri-Color', 'Chocolate', and 'White and Tan', and 'White and Black\" respectively. The height ranges from 8.5\u201311.5 inches at the shoulder (21.5\u201329.2 cm) and weight from 3.5-9 pounds. They are in many ways similar to the Miniature Fox Terrier.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nToy Fox Terriers, like many active and intelligent breeds, can learn to respond to a number of words. Toy Fox Terriers were used commonly in circus shows by clowns, and they are said to make great companions for owners with a good sense of humor.As a terrier breed, they are often active, though perhaps not as active as the Jack Russell Terrier, and are said to be well suited for older owners. They are quite trainable and often cited as making wonderful companions for people with disabilities. They are also very lovable and loyal to their owners. In addition, dogs of this breed tend not to bark very much if they are trained well.\n\n\n== Grooming ==\nThe Toy Fox Terrier is easy to groom, although grooming is generally seen as unneeded due to how short the hairs are (under a centimetre in length most of the time). Sometimes, it is necessary to comb and brush the coat. The hairs shed very frequently.\n\n\n=== Oral ===\nA Toy Fox Terrier should be given denta-bones or other chewable toys to prevent, as with most small breeds, tartar build-up that can lead to periodontal disease.  As well, daily brushing has been shown to be very beneficial as well as regular dental cleanings from the vet.\n\n\n== Health ==\nToy Fox Terriers are generally a healthy breed and require little maintenance. They are active indoors and will do without a yard, as they can usually take care of their own exercise needs. They often have trouble tolerating cold weather without careful acclimation. Their life expectancy is about fifteen years. \nToy Fox Terriers are significantly resilient, however, as with many toy breeds, some are prone to patellar luxation (slipped stifle). Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes syndrome and von Willebrand's disease are uncommon.\n\n\n== History ==\nSome Toy Fox Terrier breeders can trace their dogs\u2019 lineage back to a Smooth Fox Terrier called \"Foiler\", the first fox terrier registered by the Kennel Club in Britain, circa 1875-76.It is believed that careful breeding from smaller Smooth Fox Terriers without crosses to other toy breeds such as Manchester Terrier and Chihuahua resulted in the Toy Fox Terrier of today.\nToy Fox Terriers were recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in 1936 and placed in the Terrier Group, and by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 2003 (Toy Group).\n\n\n== See also ==\nFox Terrier, for additional details on history, genetics, coat color, etc.\nRare breeds\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDavidson, John F., The Toy Fox Terrier - Wired for Action (a 2006 revision of The Toy Fox Terrier)\nHopkins, Eliza and Flamholtz, Cathy The Toy Fox Terrier\nBielsky-Braham, Tanya, Send in the Clowns.

Neither the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale nor The Kennel Club recognize a Toy variety of the Manchester Terrier.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Manchester Terrier, from which the Toy Manchester Terrier was bred, was developed in the 19th century from crosses between an old Black and Tan Terrier with the Whippet, along with other breeds, primarily for rat-catching.In England, another breed was also developed in the 19th century in Manchester, the English Toy Terrier, as a separate breed from the Manchester Terrier. The English Toy Terrier was a popular pet in Victorian England, and bred to be very small, some weighing as little as 1 kg (2.2 lbs.)The Toy Manchester Terrier breed was developed by breeding down the Manchester Terrier in size. In the United States in the 1920s the breed was called the Toy Black and Tan Terrier. The name was changed to the Toy Manchester Terrier and the American Toy Manchester Terrier Club was formed in the 1930s. The American Toy Manchester Terrier was recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1938, but by the 1950s the breed had declined and the breed club ceased to exist. Due to declining numbers of the breed, the Toy Manchester Terrier breed was re-defined as a size division of the Manchester Terrier in 1958 by the American Kennel Club, and the club name (including the two breeds as varieties) was changed to the American Manchester Terrier Club in 1958.In England, the very similar English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan) has also declined, to the point where it is listed by the Kennel Club as being in danger of extinction. In order to rescue the breed, the Kennel Club has opened the stud book to allow certain selected examples of the North American Toy Manchester Terrier to be registered and bred as an English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan). However, the two breeds are not considered to be identical, and the standards for the two breeds show different requirements.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Toy Manchester Terrier in North America is a small, long legged dog with a short coat   marked with tan, a long tail and ears which stand upright. In color and general conformation the Toy Manchester Terrier follows the standard for the Manchester Terrier. However, the Toy Manchester Terrier cannot exceed 12 pounds (5.4 kg) in weight; and, unlike the larger Manchester Terrier, for the Toy Manchester Terrier, cropped ears are a disqualification. Ears should be wide at the base and pointed at the tip. Flaring \"bell\" ears are a serious fault, meaning that it is undesirable to breed a dog with such ears; it does not mean that the dog has any disadvantages as a companion.\n\n\n=== Black and Tan ===\nBlack and Tan is a dog coat colour that derives from one of the alleles known to exist at the genes mapped in dogs, and can be recognised with genetic testing (agouti gene, at at).\n\n\n== Similar breeds ==\nThe English Toy Terrier (Black and Tan) is considered to be the same breed as the Toy Manchester Terrier. In contrast with the Toy Manchester Terrier though, the desirable size for the English Toy Terrier (Black and Tan) is slightly smaller, and wider ears are also preferred.\nThe German Miniature Pinscher is another toy dog that some think resembles the Toy Manchester Terrier, but they really are quite different and have a very different ancestry.\nThe Russian Russkiy Toy is another similar dog, developed in Russia from early imports of the English Toy Terrier. They may be of various colours, not just Black and Tan, indicating a possible background in other breeds as well.\n\n\n== See also ==\nToy Terrier\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 489, "name": "Toy Trawler Spaniel", "country": "United Kingdom", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog489", "description": "The Toy Trawler Spaniel is an extinct breed of Spaniel which physically was similar to the King Charles Spaniel of the 16th century.

It is a strong, medium-sized scent hound, characterized by a black body, with tan and sometimes white markings on the muzzle, chest and extremities, and distinctive tan eyebrow spots. It has a high-pitched bark for a dog of its size. The breed was rescued from extinction by focused breeding efforts in the late 20th century. There were formerly two varieties, the tall and the short, developed for different kinds of hunting in the Middle Ages. Only the tall variety survives today.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe ancestors of the Transylvanian Hound came with the invading Hungarian tribes in the ninth century, who brought in hounds and crossed them with local varieties and with Polish hounds.The dog was the favourite of the Hungarian aristocracy during the breed's peak in the Middle Ages, for hunting various game animals Two height varieties developed to hunt different game in different types of terrain, and both varieties were kept together. The tall variety was used for hunting woodland and grassland big game, such as European bison, bear, boar, and lynx. The short variety was used for hunting fox, hare, and chamois in overgrown or rocky terrain.The breed declined, and was marginalised to the Carpathian woodlands, shrinking with the growth of agriculture and forestry. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the breed was nearly extinct, and not recognised and standardised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) until 1963.  In 1968, efforts began to save it.  Today, a substantial number of the tall variety of the dogs may be found in both Hungary and neighboring Romania. However, only the tall variety remains today.The Transylvanian Hound is, naturally, recognised by the national dog breeding and fancier group, the Hungarian Kennel Club (using the FCI breed standard). The breed was recognised with a breed standard by one US-based group, the United Kennel Club (UKC), in 2006. The more prominent American Kennel Club publishes no standard for it, though the organisation at least provisionally recognises its existence, announcing its acceptance in 2015 into the AKC Foundation Stock Service Program, for breeders hoping to establish it in the United States.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe breed is classified by the FCI as a medium-sized hound, with the general characteristics of the Mid-European type, in that breed registry's classification system.  The UKC classifies the breed in that registry's Scenthound group.  The Translvanian Hound is hardy, and able to tolerate rough weather conditions.\n\n\n=== Appearance and weight ===\nTransylvanian Hounds appear similar in coloring to Rottweilers, due to their black and tan fur. The FCI publishes a detailed breed standard for the Transylvanian Hound, summarised below.  The UKC standard is mostly a summary of that of the FCI; where UKC contradicts or adds to FCI specification, this has been noted.\n\n\n=== Behavior and temperament ===\nThe breed is described by the FCI standard as \"good-natured, courageous, enduring\", with a basic character that is \"quick, even, but also determined and lively\", and the UKC standard uses similar terms.Properly trained, the dogs can hunt comparatively independently, and at a considerable distance from handlers, singly or in groups.  Hunting behaviors exhibited by the breed include tracking (by scent), pointing, and driving game.The dog has a high-pitched, ringing bark.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nErd\u00e9lyi kop\u00f3, Transylvanian Hound fancier site (in Hungarian)\nCopoi ardelenesc, Transylvanian Hound portal (in Romanian) (registration required)"}, {"id": 491, "name": "Treeing Cur", "country": "United States", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog491", "description": "The Treeing Cur is a breed of dog that originated in the mid-west and was first recognized by United Kennel Club on November 1, 1998, due to the efforts of Alex and Ray Kovac. \"Most Cur breeders were not well off and so they required a dog that could serve multiple purposes: hunter, guardian, and stock dog.

The breed originated in the United States when a dog known as \"Tennessee Lead,\" was crossed into the Walker Hound in the 19th century. The Treeing Walker Coonhound was recognized officially as a breed by the United Kennel Club in 1945 and by the American Kennel Club in 2012.\nThe Treeing Walker Coonhound was bred primarily to hunt raccoons, but it is also used on other game such as deer, bear or mountain lion. The breed is vocal with a distinctive bay that allows its owner to identify their hound from great distances. It has a clear, ringing voice that changes to steady chop at the tree. Walker hounds are gentle, calm, friendly dogs who make great house pets.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Treeing Walker Coonhound was developed in the Colonial era from crosses of English Foxhounds. Two breeders from Kentucky, John W. Walker and George Washington Maupin, are given credit for the breed's initial development. The dogs they bred were referred to as Walker Hounds, and were used to hunt raccoons.\nIn the 1800s, a stolen black and tan dog named Tennessee Lead was crossed into the Walker Hound. Tennessee Lead was of unknown origin, but he greatly influenced the Walker. The Walker Coonhound, Treeing, was first recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in 1905 as a part of the English Coonhound breed, at the request of breeders. The name was later changed to Treeing Walker Coonhound, and it was fully recognized as a separate breed in 1945. It was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in January 2012, making it the AKC's 174th recognized breed.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nThe Treeing Walker Coonhound should give an impression of a working dog. According to the UKC standard, it may stand 20 to 27 inches high at maturity, with weight in proportion. The common weight range is 50 to 70 pounds, with males being larger than females.The skull should be broad, with a long muzzle and long, hanging ears. Eyes are dark and have a soft expression. All four legs should be straight when viewed from the front or back, with cat-like, compact feet. In conformation shows, blindness or deafness is a disqualification. \nThe smooth coat is fine and glossy and comes in a tricolor and a bi-color pattern. Tricolor, white with black and tan markings, is preferred, although bicolor dogs, black and white or tan and white, are acceptable.The Treeing Walker Coonhound has a clear bay on trail, which should change to a distinct \"chop\" when treed. Its temperament should be kind but fearless and courageous on the hunt.\nThe Treeing Walker Coonhound is bred primarily for mouth, looks, and ability. It is first and foremost a hunting dog, although it may be kept as a pet. It is described as affectionate and good with children, but its energy requires an outlet and it must be trained.\nThe Treeing Walker Coonhound lives an average of 12 to 13 years. \n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nTreeing Walker Coonhounds are loving, intelligent, confident, and enjoy interacting with humans. They make good companion dogs for an owner who understands the characteristics of the breed and is willing to work with their in-bred nature as a hunting dog. On the scent, they are tireless, alert, and intense. At home they are mellow, sensitive lovers of comfort. \nTreeing Walker Coonhounds get along well with other dogs and with children. Like most hounds, they are even-tempered and difficult to annoy or drive into aggression towards people or fellow dogs. With training they will coexist with small animals such as cats, despite their nature as a small-game hunter.\n\n\n== Hunting ==\n\nThe Treeing Walker Coonhound's strong tracking instincts make it popular as a hunting dog, primarily for raccoons. Hunting solo or in packs of two or more, they are used to track and tree raccoons, bobcats, cougars, and bears. Individual hounds may be adept at catching small rodents such as squirrels, roof rats, opossums, and skunks.\nBecause of their speed, Treeing Walkers may be used as deer dogs in states where hunting of antlered animals with dogs is legal.Although the Walker is best known as a coonhound, it is not as cold-nosed as other coonhounds. It is the most popular hound for competition coon hunts, since it will forego an older track for a fresher one, thereby upping the number of raccoons caught in a shorter amount of time.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCoonhound\nGrand Anglo-Fran\u00e7ais Tricolore\nAnglo-Fran\u00e7ais de Petite V\u00e9nerie\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTreeing Walker Coonhound Rarebreeds Article on Treeing Walker Coonhound\nVideo and more information on Treeing Walker Coonhounds\nContinental Kennel Club - Treeing Walker Coonhound Standard\nAKC - Treeing Walker Coonhound Standard"}, {"id": 494, "name": "Trigg Hound", "country": "Kentucky, United States", "type": "", "picture": "dog494", "description": "The Trigg Hound (also known as the Trigg Foxhound or Hayden Trigg Hound) is a variety of the American Foxhound, developed in Kentucky by Colonel Haiden Trigg.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Trigg Hound originated in Barren County, Kentucky, in the 1860s, when fox hunting enthusiast Colonel Haiden C. Trigg wanted to develop a faster hound than those available in his area. He used dogs from the Birdsong, Maupin, and Walker lines to develop his strain.\n\nAccording to W. L. Porter in an article in The Chase, local fox hunters who saw the dogs purchased from Birdsong found them unattractive, but their performance was surprisingly good. Porter stated that the dogs were \"racy built, crop ears, rough coated, bushy tails and chop mouthed and looked unlike any fox hound any of us had ever seen\". Eventually, Trigg's breeding program became successful on a local and national level.In 1910, well-known big-game hunter Paul J. Rainey purchased 25 hounds from Trigg and took them on a hunting trip in Africa, later buying more from Trigg, his son Alanson, and others. After Trigg's death, some fanciers began to lose interest and the strain declined in popularity, despite a small core of active breeders.

The variety has a long snout, hanging ears, and a short, smooth coat, and though it may come in any color, the Continental Kennel Club allows only tricolor and bicolor dogs.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Trigg Hound is obedient but \"tenacious\", and is well-suited to hunting because of its sense of smell and endurance.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 495, "name": "Tweed Water Spaniel", "country": "United Kingdom", "type": "Extinct", "picture": "dog495", "description": "The Tweed Water Spaniel, or Tweed Spaniel, is a breed of dog extinct since the 19th century. It is best known for being involved in the early development of the modern Curly Coated Retriever and Golden Retriever breeds of dogs. They were described as generally brown, athletic dogs from the area around Berwick-upon-Tweed near the River Tweed and close to the Scottish Borders. A type of water dog, the breed was not well known outside the local area. This breed may have been created by crossing local water dogs with imported St. John's water dog, another breed which is also now extinct.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe village of Norham, Northumberland, just south of the River Tweed was noted as being \"long famous\" for a breed of water spaniel of which were \"invariably brown\".In 1816, Richard Lawrence wrote of the origins of the Tweed Water Spaniel, \"Along rocky shores and dreadful declivities beyond the junction of the Tweed with the sea of Berwick, water dogs have derived an addition of strength, from the introduction of a cross with the Newfoundland dog, which has rendered them completely adequate to the arduous difficulties and diurnal perils in which they are systematically engaged.\" Although the quote refers specifically to the Newfoundland breed, it is actually more likely to mean the now extinct breed of the St. John's water dog which was sometimes referred to by its homeland's location of Newfoundland and Labrador.Stanley O'Neil, an expert in Flat-coated Retrievers, wrote of the Tweed Water Spaniel in a letter during the late 19th century, \"Further up the coast, probably Alnmouth, I saw men netting for salmon. With them was a dog with a wavy or curly coat. It was a tawny colour but, wet and spumy, it was difficult to see the exact colour, or how much was due to bleach and salt. Whilst my elders discussed the fishing I asked these Northumberland salmon net men whether their dog was a Water-Dog or a Curly, airing my knowledge. They told me he was a Tweed Water Spaniel. This was a new one on me. I had a nasty suspicion my leg was being pulled. This dog looked like a brown Water Dog to me, certainly retrieverish, and not at all spanielly. I asked if he came from a trawler, and was told it came from Berwick.\"Linda P. Case, of the University of Illinois, speculated the Tweed Water Spaniel was so named because it was developed on the estate of Lord Tweedmouth, and in fact was simply the original name for a breed of dog that later became the Golden Retriever. However, this theory is against the documented evidence, as the early development of the Golden Retriever was fully documented and listed the three Tweed Water Spaniels involved specifically by breed.\n\n\n== Appearance and temperament ==\nThe Tweed Water Spaniel had a long tail and a curly, liver-colored coat, and looked similar to the Irish Water Spaniel except  it had a heavier muzzle and a pointed skull. The dog also had thick, slightly feathered, hound-like ears, droopy lips, and fore legs that were feathered, but hind legs that were not. Their size was that of a small retriever, with a liver-coloured curly coat. Instances of offspring which were liver-coloured but tan below the knees were noted in Hugh Dalziel's 1897 work British Dogs: Their Varieties, History, Characteristics, Breeding, Management, And Exhibition, although the author speculated this may have been due to Bloodhound ancestry in one of the parents of the litters.The breed was known for its intelligence, courage, and sporting ability.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== Golden Retriever ===\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, Sir Dudley Coutts Majoribanks, Lord Tweedmouth, was developing a breed which was known at the time as a \"yellow Retriever\". This was unusual, as typically during this period all Retrievers were black. The main pairing from which the modern Golden Retrievers are said to have descended were from a dog named Nous that was a rare yellow Wavy-coated Retriever, and a female Tweed Spaniel named Belle that was given to Majoribanks by his cousin David Robertson. Four yellow puppies were produced from this pairing, named Ada,  Crocus, Primrose and Cowslip.Belle was not the only Tweed Spaniel in Majoribank's kennel. A further dog simply named Tweed was kept, although records show he was never bred, as he died at an early age. A second dog named Tweed was bred, to Cowslip from the previous Tweed/Retriever pairing which produced a further yellow puppy named Topsy. The two breeds were only crossbred two or three times, but began the development of the modern Golden Retriever.\n\n\n=== Curly Coated Retriever ===\nDuring the formation of the modern breed known as the Curly-coated Retriever, several breeds were used to bring their characteristics into this new breed. These included Poodles, Wetterhouns, Barbets, Irish Water Spaniels, and breeds that are now extinct, including the Large Rough Water Dog and the Tweed Water Spaniel. The Curly-coated Retriever has been considered purebred since the early 20th century.\n\n\n== References ==\nSpecific\nGeneral"}, {"id": 496, "name": "Tyrolean Hound", "country": "Austria", "type": "Scenthound", "picture": "dog496", "description": "The Tyrolean Hound is a breed of dog that originated in Tyrol also called the Tiroler Bracke or Tyroler Bracke. They are scent hound that descended from the Celtic Hounds in the late 1800s, mainly for their hunting skills. They are hardworking, passionate, and independent dogs not known for their size, but rather their intelligence. For that reason, hunters can regularly use these dogs to catch their prey, wounded or otherwise. Their ability to stretch over long distances, on rough hot or cold terrain for their prey is also another perk of keeping this dog by your side. Hunters do have to worry about injuries to their dog, however, along with the common injuries that these dogs obtain throughout their life, like hip dysplasia or ear infections. Barring any injuries, these dogs tend to live an energetic life for about 12-14 years, and tend to be an overall healthy and robust dog.\n\n\n== Description and History ==\nThe Tyrolean Hound, also known as the Tyroler Bracke, is a breed of scent hound originally developed in the 1800's from the ancient Celtic and Bracke hounds. It was first bred in Tyrol as a dog adapted to hunting in the snow. Emperor Maximilian I used this hound for hunting hare and fox and for tracking wounded game. Breeding began in 1860, and then in 1896 the first standard of breeding was published. Followed shortly thereafter, the Tyrolean Hound was recognized as their own breed in 1908. It was not until 2006, that the Tyrolean Hound was recognized by the United Kennel Club.As with dogs that come from hardworking scent hound breeds, the Tyrolean hound was bred for their hunting ability. The breed is known for their excellent ability in being able to maneuver through mountainous or heavily wooded areas, and for their amazing scenting skills. This is all made possible with the size of the Tyrolean Hound. It tends to be a medium to large dog, measuring in at about 18.5 to 24 inches tall, and weighing about 35 to 60 pounds for males. Females tend to be smaller physically, only growing to be about 16.5 to 19 inches tall, however, both have a nice flowing outline and tend to be fairly muscular. The Tyrolean Hound, whether male or female, also has a thick double coat, with a coarse undercoat, as opposed to fine. They also tend to have the 3 main colors of red, black, and tan, with patches of white mixed in between. \n\n\n=== Body Breakdown ===\n\n\n==== Head ====\nThe head of the Tyrolean Hound is fairly broad with a slight arch going down the middle. This arch continues into the deep and straight muzzle of the dog, ending down at either a black or brown nose, with black is more desirable.The teeth of the Tyrolean Hound should be spaced, and it would be normal to notice that the dog is missing one or two premolars. Above the snout, the eyes are not so deeply set, and tend to be dark brown, large, and round. Laying on top of the eye, the third eyelid should be pigmented and the eye rims should be close fitting. Above the eyes, this medium-sized hound has broad flat ears set high on the head with rounded ends. The ears can even reach up to the end of the nose when pulled forward.\n\n\n==== Body ====\nThe body is compact and rectangular in shape. They have a thick double coat including a coarse undercoat. There are two main colors, red and black with some tan, both of which may have white markings. It has a fast gait and can be used for either tracking or hunting. They have a deep chest that is moderately broad with a muscular fore-chest. The shoulder blades and upper arms are sloping and form a near right angle. The withers are pronounced and the croup slopes gently down the dog. The forelegs are straight with a medium bone, while the hind legs are well feathered, broad, and muscular. Lastly, the tail is set high on the back with a saber curve. The tail is carried high when the dog is excited, and preferably presents feathered with a thick brush of fur.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nLike many working dogs, the Tyrolean hound is highly active, affectionate, and free-spirited. This is a highly intelligent dog and because of that, it tends to be very independent. While it can be stubborn from time to time, it can be easily trained. For this reason, the dog can make a good family pet, preferably with a big yard or constant access to an open field.While the dog can have an independent streak and may lead to misbehavior, hunters often appreciate the fact that this dog can hunt alone, following wounded game for long distances. They are widely respected for the ability to hunt in hot and cold weather and in most any terrain. They have a quick, ground covering, and enduring gait, which makes for a passionate hunter who is fast and efficient. Alert and lively, though wary of strangers, this dog can be a tenacious hunter all the way down to a great stay at home pet, almost as if it has an ability to \"switch off\" and come home to rest. While their lack of aggression limits their ability to be a guard dog, they still have a loud bark to warn anyone that something is amiss, making them great watch dogs.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\n\n=== Lifespan and Lifestyle ===\nTyrolean Hounds have an average life expectancy of about 12 to 14 years overall. These dogs are robust and generally healthy. They need to keep an active lifestyle and have high exercise requirements, though not hyperactive. As puppies, they should be given high-quality dry food until about 12 months when they can be transferred over to adult dry food. They can also take either active or working dog formulas, respectively with their lifestyle. When they are adults it can be necessary to keep them engaged with mental stimulation. Without such exercises or obedience training, they may lose passion in their work or other nuisance behaviors may appear. Also, with the harsh double coat that the Tyrolean Hound bares, they may need to be brushed once or two times a week along with other various health duties such as; teeth brushing, coat grooming, and a weekly ear cleaning.\n\n\n=== Common Health Problems ===\n\n\n==== Hip Dysplasia ====\nHip Dysplasia is often common in medium to larger sized dogs, especially when they are purebred. This is when the hip forms abnormally, leading to a chronic \"wear and tear\" leading to inflammation and osteoarthritis.\n\n\n==== Hunting Injuries ====\nGoing hunting provides is own obstacles and hardships for the Tyrolean Hound. Not only is there the uneven ground and the excess vegetation that may grow there, but there is also the rotten branches and even the prey they are hunting themselves that can strike back.\n\n\n==== Ear Infections ====\nThe large and droopy ears of the Tyrolean Hound make them very susceptible to infection, particularly when they go swimming. Any of the moisture or foreign debris that finds its way into the ear can cause bacteria and yeast build up, which leads to an ear infection. This can be maintained by cleaning out the ears whenever they come in from hunting, or by routinely cleaning them weekly.\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 497, "name": "Cimarr\u00f3n Uruguayo", "country": "Uruguay", "type": "Guardian Dog", "picture": "dog497", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 498, "name": "Gos Rater Valenci\u00e0", "country": "Spain", "type": "", "picture": "dog498", "description": "No description available."}, {"id": 499, "name": "Vanjari Hound", "country": "India", "type": "", "picture": "dog499", "description": "The Vanjari Hound (Malayalam: \u0d35\u0d1e\u0d4d\u0d1a\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d3f \u0d39\u0d57\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d4d) is a breed of dog found in India.

The Hungarian or Magyar Vizsla are sporting dogs and loyal companions, in addition to being the smallest of the all-round pointer-retriever breeds. The Vizsla's medium size is one of the breed's most appealing characteristics as a hunter of fowl and upland game and, through the centuries, the Vizsla has held a rare position among sporting dogs \u2013 that of household companion and family dog. \nThe Vizsla is a natural hunter endowed with an excellent nose and an outstanding trainability. It was bred to work in fields, forests, or bodies of water. Although they are lively, gentle-mannered, demonstrably affectionate and sensitive, they are also fearless and possess a well-developed protective instinct.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Vizsla is a medium-sized short-coated hunting dog of distinguished appearance and bearing. Robust, but rather lightly built, they are lean dogs, and have defined muscles.\nVarious breeds are often mistaken for Vizslas, and Vizslas are often mistaken for other breeds. Redbone Coonhounds, Weimaraners and Rhodesian Ridgebacks are some of the most commonly confused breeds. The body structure of a Vizsla is very similar in appearance to a Weimaraner and a Redbone Coonhound, though the Vizsla is typically leaner with a more defined musculature. Weimaraners and Rhodesian Ridgebacks are larger than Vizslas. The nose of the Vizsla will always have a reddish color that blends with the coat color. Black, brown, light pink, or another color nose is an indication of another breed. A Vizsla's eye and nail color should also blend with the coat color.\n\n\n==== Color and coats ====\nThe standard coat is a solid golden-rust color in several shadings, but some breeding programs have resulted in a solid rust coat. The coat could also be described as a copper-brown color, russet gold, and dark sandy gold. Solid, dark, mahogany red and pale yellow are considered faults and a disqualification. Small areas of white on the fore-chest, neck, or tail are permissible but not preferred. Some variations in the Vizsla coat color along their back (saddle-type marks) are typical.\nThe American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standard for the Vizsla states that the coat should be short, smooth, dense, and close-lying, without a woolly undercoat. The Vizsla is totally unsuited to being kept outside since, unlike most other breeds, it does not have an undercoat. They are self-cleaning dogs and infrequently need to be bathed, if ever, and have little noticeable \"dog smell\" detectable by humans. After several forays into lakes and streams they will develop an aroma that is a weaker version of the 'wet dog' smell. A quick bath and this odor will vanish.\n\n\n==== Size ====\nThe Vizsla is a medium-sized dog, The average height and weight:\n\nMales\nHeight: 22\u201325 in (56\u201364 cm)\nWeight: 45\u201366 lb (20\u201330 kg)\nFemales\nHeight: 21\u201324 in (53\u201361 cm)\nWeight: 40\u201355 lb (18\u201325 kg)Vizsla appearance\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Tail ====\n\nThe American breed standard calls for the tail to be docked to two-thirds of its original length. Breed standards in countries where docking is banned, such as the United Kingdom, do not require this. The Vizsla holds its tail horizontal to the ground and wags it vigorously while charging through rough scrub and undergrowth.\nThe docked tail of the Vizsla is significantly longer than that of other dogs with traditionally docked tails such as the Weimaraner, Dobermann, Boxer, and Australian Shepherd. Since the tail is docked when the puppy is less than three days old, this longer dock can result in some variation in tail length among Vizsla dogs from different breeding programs.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nVizslas are very high energy, gentle-mannered, loyal, caring, and highly affectionate. They quickly form close bonds with their owners, children, and even strangers. Often, they are referred to as \"velcro\" dogs because of their loyalty and affection. Vizslas will cry or whine when they feel neglected or are otherwise unhappy. Some will bark at strangers if they feel that they are invading the \"pack\" space. They are very good guard dogs when trained to be so.\nThey are natural hunters with an excellent ability to take training. Not only are they great pointers, but they are excellent retrievers as well. They will retrieve on land and in the water making the most of their natural instincts. However, they must be trained gently and without harsh commands or strong physical correction, as they have sensitive temperaments and can be easily damaged if trained too harshly. However the owner must show quiet authority in training, otherwise the dog is likely to take over the training session.\nVizslas are excellent swimmers. Some may need a little motivation to get in the water but as they get used to it they will love it. Like all hunting dogs, Vizslas require a great deal of exercise to remain healthy and happy.\nThe Vizsla thrives on attention, exercise, and interaction. They are intelligent dogs and need a lot of mental stimulation when young. If left alone for long hours, they can be bored and destructive. With proper socialization and training, Vizslas are very gentle dogs that can be great around children. The Vizsla wants to be close to its owner as much as possible.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nA Vizsla Club of America survey puts the average lifespan of the Vizsla at 9.15 years.  The Vizsla is considered to be a robust dog but some localized breeding programs using a small number of dogs have led to heritable illnesses in some offspring including:\n\nHip dysplasia is very rare but remotely possible.\nCanine epilepsy\nCancer (mast cell tumors, hemangiosarcoma, lymphoma)\nSebaceous adenitisResponsible breeders do not select dogs for breeding if they have such inherent problems.\nVizslas can also suffer from hypothyroidism, dwarfism, persistent right aortic arch, tricuspid valve dysplasia, and progressive retinal atrophy. Major risks include epilepsy and lymphosarcoma. Vizslas can also be prone to skin and food allergies.Unlike many other dogs, Vizslas do not have an undercoat. Therefore, they are unsuited for living outdoors.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Vizsla was already known in early Hungarian history. The ancestors of the present Vizsla were the trusted and favorite hunting dogs of the Magyar tribes that lived in the Pannonian Basin in the 10th century. Primitive stone etchings over a thousand years old show the Magyar hunter with his falcon and his Vizsla.\nThe first written reference to the Vizsla dog breed has been recorded in the Illustrated Vienna Chronicle prepared on order of King Louis I of Hungary by the Carmelite Friars in 1357.As companions of the early warlords and barons, Vizsla blood was preserved pure for centuries by the land-owning aristocracy who guarded them jealously and continued to develop the hunting ability of these \"yellow-pointers\". Records of letters and writings show the high esteem in which the Vizsla was held.\nThe Vizsla has survived the Turkish occupation (1526\u20131696), the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, World War I, World War II and the Hungarian People's Republic. However, Vizslas faced and survived several near-extinctions in their history, including being overrun by English Pointers and German Shorthaired Pointers in the 1800s (Boggs, 2000:19) and again to near-extinction after World War II. A careful search of Hungary and a poll of Hungarian sportsmen revealed only about a dozen Vizslas of the true type still alive in the country. From that minimum stock, the breed rose to prominence once again. The various \"strains\" of the Vizsla have become somewhat distinctive as individuals bred stock that suited their hunting style. Outside Hungary, vizslas are commonly bred in Romania, Austria, Slovakia, and Serbia.\nThe Vizsla started arriving in the United States at the close of World War II. As interest in and devotion to the breed began to increase, owners formed the Vizsla Club of America in order to gain AKC recognition. As a result of registering foundation stock with the AKC, Vizsla owners were able to obtain official recognition on 25 November 1960, as the Vizsla became the 115th breed recognized by the American Kennel Club.The Vizsla was used in development of other breeds, most notably the Weimaraner, Wirehaired Vizsla and German Shorthaired Pointer breeds. There is much conjecture about those same breeds, along with other pointer breeds, being used to reestablish the Vizsla breed at the end of the 19th century.\n\n\n=== Vizsla in the UK ===\nApproximately 4,520 Vizsla puppies are registered with the Kennel Club of Great Britain (KC) each year, making the breed one of the top 50 most popular. The number is steadily rising year after year as more people recognize the breed. There are two breed clubs for the Vizsla in Britain, The Hungarian Vizsla Club and The Hungarian Vizsla Society. The winner of the Best In Show award at Crufts 2010 was a Vizsla named Hungargunn Bear It'n Mind.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nFormer White House Press Secretary and cohost of The Five, Dana Perino has owned a Vizsla, Henry.

Specimens from this group have been found preserved in European peat bogs which anthropologists trace to 4000 BC. The remains with curly tails, foxy heads, and small erect ears, have been found dating back over 5,000 years. These little pets wore decorative ivory bracelets and collars. Engravings of similar dogs were found in Greece from 400bc called Melitan. Michelangelo owned a Volpino and would paint them in his paintings. In the Sistine Chapel left side, third from rear, lower left corner, painted 1508-1512.\nIn 1903 the FCI recognized the Volpino Italiano as an Italian breed.\nQueen Victoria of England went to Florence, Italy, in 1888 and brought her first Volpinos. White Turi, red Fluffy, Gena/Gina, Bippo, Lenda, and Lena were the names of her Volpinos.\nArtifacts and paintings, dating back to the 1500s, with little white curly tails and erect ears are found and preserved in the British Museum.The Volpino has been known and loved by Italian royalty for centuries, being a special favorite of the ladies. Although bearing a strong resemblance to the Pomeranian, the breed is much older and thus has a different background. The northern dogs found their way south very early in the history of domesticated dogs. Volpino means \"foxy (dog)\" in Italian, where the dog is also called Lupino meaning \"wolfy (dog)\".\nDespite the Volpino Italiano long history, the Volpino became unknown outside of Italy until the 1880s and is now quite rare but making a comeback since the 1980s as American Eskimo breeders went to Italy took them back to America changed the name to American Eskimo, even though they looked nothing like the Eski, they claimed they were the runts then mixing with the Eski's. Toy and mini Eski's are originally Volpino's but now since mixed they no longer hold the royal Volpino Italiano status.\n\nDespite its small size, this dog was originally kept as a guard dog. Its job was to alert the large mastiffs to an intruder. However, due to their lovely temperament and intelligence they also became popular as pets. For unknown reasons the breed's popularity dropped and in 1965 the last dogs were registered. In 1984 an attempt was made to revive the breed by Enrico Franceschetti and the ENCI. The dogs still living as guard dogs on farms became the new breeding stock. Volpinos remain rare with about 4,000 dogs worldwide. Most are in Italy but some people are now breeding them in 15 countries including Canada, Finland, Brazil, Denmark, Russia, Ireland, Holland, Greece, Scandinavia, Sweden, Hungary, Holland, UK and the USA.\nA 2006 survey of kennel clubs found an average of 120 puppies registered each year in Italy (with ENCI) and a total of 200-300 registered each in Sweden, Norway and Finland, 20 per year in America.\n\n\n== Clubs and organizations ==\nItalian National Kennel Club (Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia Italiana) (ENCI) [1]\nNorth American Volpino Club [2]\nVolpino Club of America [3]\nVolpino Italiano health and genealogy [4]\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe Volpino makes a good watchdog, and some can even be used as gun-dogs (bird dogs) if trained properly. They will make extremely active, affectionate pets.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe basic well being and health of the Volpino Italiano breed are far better than with most dogs. However they are not immune to genetic and other diseases.\nAs of mid-2013, the greatest threat facing this race is the genetic mutation of the eye lens called primary lens luxation (PLL). This is an extremely painful disease that manifests itself when the zonal cords holding the lens in place weaken and break at a genetically pre-determined time (usually about 4 to 8 years old). Once the zonal cords break, the lens begins to move into the interior of the eye increasing the pressure in the eye and causing the animal great pain.  Because of the expense in removing the lens or the eyes, the animal is usually euthanized.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLap dog\nSpitz\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 504, "name": "Weimaraner", "country": "Germany", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog504", "description": "The Weimaraner ( VY-m\u0259-rah-n\u0259r) is a large dog that was originally bred for hunting in the early 19th century. Early Weimaraners were used by royalty for hunting large game such as boar, bear and deer. As the popularity of large game hunting began to decline, Weimaraners were used for hunting smaller animals like fowl, rabbits and foxes.\nThe Weimaraner is an all-purpose gun dog. The name comes from the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Karl August, whose court, located in the city of Weimar (now in the state of Thuringia in modern-day Germany), enjoyed hunting.\n\n\n== History ==\nToday's breed standards are alleged to have been developed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. However, Chien-gris dogs, having features very similar to those of the Weimaraner, have been traced as far back as the 13th century in the court of Louis IX of France, during which most aristocrats owned one and used them for hunting. One theory is that the ancestor is the St. Hubert Hound (also known as the Bloodhound and Sleuth Hound).\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Weimaraner is athletic in appearance. Traditionally, the tail is docked. In countries where this is still carried out, the docked tail should measure approximately 6 inches in the adult dog, and this is part of the American Kennel Club breed standard.  Tail docking is illegal in several countries, where the breed is shown with an entire tail. The British Kennel Club breed standard describes a tail reaching to the hocks and carried below the level of the back when relaxed, and the German breed club standard calls for a full tail that is strong and well coated, which can be carried above the line of the back when the dog is working. Weimaraners are great water dogs as evidenced by their webbed paws.\nThe eyes of the Weimaraner may be light amber, grey or blue-grey.\n\n\n==== Coat and color ====\n\nThis breed's short coat and unusual eyes give it a distinctive regal appearance. The coat is extremely low-maintenance, short, hard, and smooth to the touch, and may range from charcoal-blue to mouse-grey to silver-grey or even blue-grey. Where the fur is thin or non-existent, inside the ears or on the lips for example, the skin should be pinkish rather than white or black. This breed does not have an undercoat, so extreme cold should be avoided. While their coat is short, this breed does shed. The Weimaraner's coat color led to its nickname of \"the Grey Ghost\".\nIn November 2009 and January 1, 2010, the United Kennel Club (UKC) removed the disqualification from both Blue and Longhair Weimaraners. A black coat remains an automatic disqualification, though a small white marking in the chest area only is permitted. Dogs with blue coats are disqualified from conformation/show competition, but are recognized as purebred Weimaraners by the AKC.  There is another incidental variety, described as having the \"mark of the hound\", where the dog is the usual grey colour but with faint tan markings (similar to Doberman Pinschers). Weimaraners can have several unique physical characteristics such as small lobes on the inside of the ear, known as \"Harrasburg Horns\", and \"Grafmar's Caps\", very light gray patches between the ears.A long-haired variety is recognized by most kennel clubs around the world except the American Kennel Club. The long-haired Weimaraner has a silky coat with an undocked, feathered tail.  The gene is recessive, so breeding will produce some long-haired puppies only if both parents carry the trait.\n\n\n==== Size ====\nAccording to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale standard, the male Weimaraner stands between 59 to 70 cm (23 to 28 in) at the withers. Females are between 57 to 65 cm (22 to 26 in). Males normally weigh about  30\u201340 kg (66\u201388 lb). Females are generally between 25\u201335 kg (55\u201377 lb). A Weimaraner should give the appearance of a muscular, athletic dog. \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe Weimaraner is an energetic hunting dog, prized for its physical endurance and stamina, with a strong, instinctive prey-drive. It may tolerate cats but usually does not, tending to follow the urge to hunt\u2014no matter how long it has known a particular cat\u2014and likely to chase and kill any small animal that enters the garden. A Weimaraner requires frequent exercise and will appreciate games and play. An active owner is more likely to provide the vigorous exercise and games required. A Weimaraner requires appropriate training to learn how to be calm and control its behavior.\n\n\n=== As a hunting dog ===\nWeimaraners have an excessive amount of energy that requires a good outlet.  They are well-rounded hunting dogs that excel at hunting, tracking, pointing and retrieving both on land and in the water.  The Weimaraner is a very people-oriented breed.  They have a very strong desire to work and live with their owners, making the breed a good choice for the novice hunter. It requires a gentle touch when training to hunt and it often learns best from a seasoned hunting dog.\n\n\n=== Behavior disorders ===\nWeimaraners are not an independent breed and love to be with their owner, never leaving them alone.  This can create very severe separation anxiety in the breed. The causes of separation anxiety are not always known, but there are precluding factors including genetics, litter rearing, dominance, submission, boredom and stress.  Weimaraners with severe separation anxiety can destroy property or injure themselves in trying to escape.  Good training can curb some of the separation anxiety. A Weimaraner with separation anxiety is likely to bark, whine, howl and even dig until its owner returns home. Further manifestations of this problem can include panicking and excessive drooling, along with destructive behaviors and injury.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nAccording to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, Weimaraners enjoy low rates of dysplasia. The breed is ranked 102nd of 153 total breeds and has a very high test rate and a very high percentage of excellent rating among those dogs tested.  It is generally recommended to acquire Weimaraners only from breeders who have their dogs' hips tested using OFA or PennHIP methods.\nAs a deep-chested dog, the Weimaraner is prone to bloat or gastric torsion, a very serious condition that can cause painful and rapid death when left untreated. It occurs when the stomach twists itself, thereby pinching off blood vessels and the routes of food traveling in or out. Symptoms include signs of general distress, discomfort, no bowel movement or sounds and a swollen stomach. Immediate medical attention is imperative when bloat occurs and surgery is the only option if it is caught early enough.\nOne way to help prevent bloat is to spread out the Weimaraner's feedings to at least twice daily and to avoid any vigorous exercise an hour before or after meals. It is also recommended that the dog's feeding dish not be placed on a raised platform to discourage it from gobbling its food too quickly and keep air from entering the stomach.  Raised food bowls have been found to more than double the risk of bloat in large dogs.Skin allergies are common among weimeraners. A vet should be consulted if a dog starts to lose hair, itch constantly or develop rashes. Parasites can cause an allergic reaction in addition to the normal irritation resulting from bites.\nOther health issues include:\n\nCryptorchidism\nElbow dysplasia\nDistichiasis\nVon Willebrands Disease\nEntropion\nHypothyroidism\nHypertrophic osteodystrophy\nPituitary dwarfism\nHypomyelinogenesis\nRenal dysplasia\nProgressive retinal atrophy\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nWeimaraner at Curlie\nThe Weimaraner Pedigree database"}, {"id": 505, "name": "Cardigan Welsh Corgi", "country": "United Kingdom, Wales", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog505", "description": "The Cardigan Welsh Corgi  is one of two separate dog breeds known as Welsh corgis that originated in Wales, predating the other breed, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi. It is one of the oldest breeds of the British Isles.Cardigan Welsh Corgis are known to be an extremely loyal dog breed. They are also versatile and can live in a variety of settings. However, they benefit from regular physical and mental stimulation.\n\n\n== History ==\nPembroke and Cardigan corgis were originally listed as one breed by The Kennel Club in Britain in 1925, but were declared separate breeds in 1935. The Corgi Club was founded in December, 1925 in Carmarthen in South Wales. It is reported that the local members favored the Pembroke breed, so a club for Cardigan enthusiasts was founded a year later (1926). Both groups have worked hard to ensure the appearance and type of breed are standardized through careful selective breeding. Pembrokes and Cardigans were officially recognized by the Kennel Club in 1928 and were lumped together under the heading Welsh Corgis. In 1934, the two breeds were recognized individually and shown separately.\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nCardigans are said to originate from the Teckel family of dogs, which also produced Dachshunds.\nThey are claimed to be among the oldest of all herding breeds; believed to have been in existence in Wales since around the year 1200 B.C.\n\n\n=== Name ===\nThe word \"corgi\" is derived from the Welsh: cor gi, which means \"dwarf dog\". The breed was formerly called \"yard-long dog\" (Welsh: ci-llathed). Today's name comes from their area of origin: Cardigan (Welsh 'Ceredigion').\n\n\n=== Modern breed ===\nOriginally used only as a farm guardian, they eventually took on the traits of a cattle drover, herder, and many more. They are still highly valued for their herding, working, and guarding skills, as well as their companionship. \n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Cardigan is a long, low dog with upright ears and a fox brush tail.  The old American Kennel Club standard called it an \"Alsatian on short legs\". The Cardigan's tail is long (unlike the Pembroke Welsh Corgi, whose tail may be long, naturally bobbed or docked).\nCardigans, which are double coated,  come in a variety of colors including any shade of red, sable, or brindle, as well as black, with or without tan, brindle or blue merle, with or without tan or brindle points. Other unofficial colors can occur, such as red merle, but these colors are not considered acceptable per the Cardigan standard. They usually have white on the neck, chest, legs, muzzle, underneath, tip of the tail and as a blaze on the head, known as the \"Irish pattern.\" Other markings include ticking on the legs and muzzle, smutty muzzles and monk's hoods, especially on sables (a pattern of darker tipped hairs over a basic red coat color.).  An average Cardigan is around 10 to 13 inches (250 to 330 mm) tall at the withers and weighs from 30 to 38 pounds (14 to 17 kg) for the male and 25 to 34 pounds (11 to 15 kg) for the female.Life expectancy is 12\u201316 years.  Litter size can vary; usually four to six puppies.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nThe most common causes of death for the breed were cancer (28.3%), old age (24.6%), and neurological disorders (15.2%).\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nOriginally bred for farm work, including herding sheep and cattle. Cardigan Welsh Corgis were bred long and low to make sure that any kicks by cattle would travel safely over the dogs' heads without touching them.Cardigans are highly intelligent, active, athletic dogs.\nHousepet They have proven themselves as excellent companion animals, Cardigans are affectionate, devoted companions that can also be alert and responsible guardians. If socialized at a young age, they can be nice with other dogs and housepets.Competitive in sheepdog trials, dog agility, competitive obedience and rally obedience.\nGuard Dogs Cardigans are typically excellent watchdogs, as they are highly alert to the approach of strangers to their territory, and will be very vocal until they and/or their owner are assured that the stranger poses no threat. They tend to be wary of strangers and to reserve their affection for a select few with whom they are familiar.\n\n\n== Use as working dogs ==\nCardigan Welsh Corgis compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball and tracking events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Corgis exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMyCorgi.com (non-profit charity & social networking for corgi owners)Cardigan Welsh Corgi at Curlie"}, {"id": 506, "name": "Pembroke Welsh Corgi", "country": "United Kingdom, Wales", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog506", "description": "The Pembroke Welsh Corgi (; Welsh for \"dwarf dog\") is a cattle herding dog breed which originated in Pembrokeshire, Wales. It is one of two breeds known as a Welsh Corgi. The other is the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, and both descend from the line that is the northern spitz-type dog (examples include that of the Siberian Husky). Another theory is that Pembrokes are descended from the Swedish Vallhunds, which were crossed with the local Welsh herding dogs. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is the younger of the two Corgi breeds and is a separate and distinct breed from the Cardigan. The corgi is one of the smallest dogs in the Herding Group. Pembroke Welsh Corgis are famed for being the preferred breed of Queen Elizabeth II, who has owned more than 30 during her reign. These dogs have been favored by British royalty for more than seventy years, but among the British public, have recently fallen into decline in terms of popularity and demand.The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has been ranked at #11 in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, and per source, is considered an excellent working dog.\nAccording to the American Kennel Club, Pembroke Welsh Corgis were ranked 20th most popular breed of dog in 2015.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nThe Pembroke Welsh Corgi sheds extensively, often daily with coat \"blow outs\" often twice a year. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has erect ears which are proportional to the equilateral triangle of the head. The ears should also be firm, medium in size, and tapered slightly to a rounded point. The head should be foxy in shape and appearance. Pembroke Welsh Corgis differ from the Cardigan Welsh Corgi by being shorter in length, having smaller ears, and being slightly straighter of leg. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has a \"fairy saddle\", somewhat lighter markings on each side of the withers caused by changes in the thickness, length, and direction of hair growth. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi sheds mostly in the spring and fall and may shed annually, with intact females shedding during heat.Breed faults exist; some which may acknowledge genetic health conditions such as \"fluffies\" which are Corgis with very long coats, and \"bluies,\" which have a dilute colour (red coats present with a bluish cast).Some Pembroke Welsh Corgis are born with their tail naturally short or missing. Others may have their tails docked between 2\u20135 days old due to historical tradition or as a measure of conformation to the Breed Standard. Artificial docking was born of necessity given the Pembroke's function as a herding dog in the United Kingdom. According to Tax Law, any companion canine was considered a luxury and pet/companion owners were levied a tax. Dog owners, however, who kept dogs for working purposes such as herding were exempt from the tax. In order to claim the exemption, owners had to ensure the dogs sported docked or bobbed tails. The Kennel Club, the United Kennel Club, and the FCI allow intact tails in Conformation shows. The AKC Standard states tails should be docked no longer than 2 inches (5 cm). In many countries, docking has been deemed illegal.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nPembroke Welsh Corgis are very affectionate, love to be involved in the family, and tend to follow wherever their owners go. They have a great desire to please their owners, thus making them eager to learn and train. The dogs are easy to train and are ranked as the eleventh smartest dog in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs. Besides herding, they also function as watchdogs due to their alertness and tendency to bark only as needed. Most Pembrokes will seek the attention of everyone they meet and behave well around children and other pets.  It is important to socialise this breed with other animals, adults, and children when they are very young to avoid any anti-social behavior or aggression later in life. Due to their herding instinct, they love to chase anything that moves, so it is best to keep them inside fenced areas. The herding instinct will also cause some younger Pembrokes to nip at their owners' ankles.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nPembrokes have an average life expectancy of 12\u201315 years.\nPembroke Welsh Corgis are achondroplastic, meaning they are a \"true dwarf\" breed. As such, their stature and build can lead to certain non-inherited health conditions, but genetic issues should also be considered. Commonly, Pembrokes can suffer from monorchidism, Von Willebrand's disease, hip dysplasia, degenerative myelopathy  (DM), and inherited eye problems such as progressive retinal atrophy.  Genetic testing is available for Pembroke Welsh Corgis to avoid these issues and enhance the genetic health pool.\nPembrokes are also prone to obesity given a robust appetite, characteristic of herding group breeds.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Pembroke Welsh Corgi lineage has been traced back as far as 1107 AD. It is said that the Vikings and Flemish weavers brought the dogs with them as they traveled to reside in Wales. As far back as the 10th century, corgis were herding sheep, geese, ducks, horses, and cattle as one of the oldest herding breed of dogs.\nPembroke Welsh Corgis are closely related to Schipperkes, Keeshonds, Pomeranians, Samoyeds, Chow Chows, Norwegian Elkhounds, and Finnish Spitz. Pembrokes and Cardigans first appeared together in 1925 when they were shown under the rules of The Kennel Club in Britain. The Corgi Club was founded in December 1925 in Carmarthen, Carmarthenshire. It is reported that the local members favored the Pembroke breed, so a club for Cardigan enthusiasts was founded a year or so later. Both groups have worked hard to ensure the appearance and type of breed are standardized through careful selective breeding. Pembrokes and Cardigans were officially recognized by the Kennel Club in 1928 and were initially categorized together under the single heading of Welsh Corgis, before the two breeds were recognized as separate and distinct in 1934.Pembroke Welsh Corgis are becoming more popular in the United States and rank 20th (24th) in American Kennel Club registrations, as of 2015 (2012). However, corgis are now listed as a \"vulnerable\" breed in the United Kingdom; the decline has been said to be due to a 2007 ban on tail-docking (the practice of cutting off the animal\u2019s tail) in the U.K., as well as the lack of breeders in the U.K. In 2009, the corgi was added to The Kennel Club's \"At Watch\" list of British breeds when annual registrations numbered between 300 and 450. In 2014, the breed was put on the Club's \"Vulnerable Native Breeds\" list when registrations dropped under 300. In 2018, the breed came off the \"At Risk\" list with 456 puppies registered in December 2017. The Kennel Club has credited the renewed interest in the breed to the popular Netflix television series, The Crown.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nPembroke Welsh Corgis can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests.\n\n\n== Queen Elizabeth's Corgis ==\n\nAt a young age, the Queen\u2019s passion for this breed started when her father, King George VI, brought home their first royal corgi who was later named \u201cDookie\u201d. The Queen ceased breeding corgis around 2012 so as not to leave any behind after she dies; her last corgi, Willow, died 18 April 2018.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links =="}, {"id": 507, "name": "Welsh Sheepdog", "country": "United Kingdom, Wales", "type": "", "picture": "dog507", "description": "The Welsh Sheepdog (Welsh: Ci Defaid Cymreig, pronounced [ki\u02d0 \u02c8d\u025bva\u026ad k\u0259m\u02c8r\u025b\u0268\u0261]) is a landrace of herding dog from Wales. Some people incorrectly call a Welsh Sheepdog a Welsh Collie - usually 'Welsh Collie' is used for a cross between a Welsh Sheepdog and a Border Collie, who is often a milder dog and easier to manage than the pure breed.\nLike other types of working dog, Welsh Sheepdogs are normally bred for their herding abilities rather than appearance, and so they are generally somewhat variable in build, colour and size.  Welsh Sheepdogs are of collie type, usually black-and-white, red-and-white or tricolour, and merle markings may occur over any of these combinations.  The coat may be short or fairly long, and the ears are pricked, but usually folded at the tip.  They are longer in leg, broader in chest and wider in muzzle than the Border Collie. They are extremely active and intelligent, and therefore need much exercise and mental stimulation, if they are to be kept as pets.\nOver many decades the Welsh Sheepdog has largely been replaced for working sheep in Wales by the Border Collie, a standardised breed. However, in more recent years, efforts have been made to maintain the indigenous Welsh Sheepdog as a distinct variety.\nWelsh Sheepdogs are usually of loose-eyed action, not fixing the stock with their gaze like the strong-eyed Border Collie.  They are able to work independently without necessarily being under direct human control.  Welsh Sheepdogs are most often used for herding sheep, but also readily work cattle, goats, and even horses and pigs.  Traditionally they were often used as droving dogs to take cattle and sheep to markets locally or elsewhere in Britain.\nThe Welsh Sheepdog's life span is 12\u201315 years.\n\n\n== History ==\nAt one time there existed many sheep-herding dogs peculiar to Wales; during the 18th century Welsh drovers taking sheep for sale took with them five or six sheepdogs as \"herders on the narrow roads, guards against highwaymen, and providers of game on the route\". These were an early type of Welsh Sheepdog, higher on the leg and more racily built than the modern day breed.However, by the 1940s the group had decreased to two or three breeds only. The ancient pure breeds of Black-and-Tan Sheepdog and Welsh Hillman were almost extinct, and were scarcely seen working.  The type best known in Wales at that time was mostly descended from the old Black-and-Tan with an infusion of working Border Collie blood.In the 1940s the Welsh Sheepdog was still common throughout the north and central Welsh counties.  In herding activities, it did not normally work low to the ground in \"the showy manner sometimes seen in the work of the working [Border] Collies\", as British dog fancier C. L. B. Hubbard put it in 1948. It was variable in type; approximately 18 in (46 cm) in height, but the weight ranged from the lighter built, leggier dog of North Wales at 35 lb (16 kg) to the more solid 40 to 45 lb (18 to 20 kg) dogs of Glamorganshire and Monmouthshire.  There were no dog show classes for the Welsh Sheepdog as it was purely a working breed.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nWelsh Sheepdogs are primarily herding dogs who have a natural ability with large flocks of sheep or cattle.  Some have been trained to compete in dog agility trials, obedience, rally obedience, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Welsh Sheepdogs can be trained to compete in stock dog trials.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWelsh Sheepdog Society\nThe Welsh Sheepdog\nBreeds From A Common Root and the Welsh Sheepdog"}, {"id": 508, "name": "Welsh Springer Spaniel", "country": "United Kingdom, Wales", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog508", "description": "The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a breed of dog and a member of the spaniel family. Thought to be comparable to the old Land Spaniel, they are similar to the English Springer Spaniel and historically have been referred to as both the Welsh Spaniel and the Welsh Cocker Spaniel. They were relatively unknown until a succession of victories in dog trials by the breed increased its popularity. Following recognition by The Kennel Club in 1902, the breed gained the modern name of Welsh Springer Spaniel. The breed's coat only comes in a single colour combination of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern. Loyal and affectionate, they can become very attached to family members and are wary of strangers. Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions. They are a working dog, bred for hunting, and while not as rare as some varieties of spaniel, they are rarer than the more widely known English Springer Spaniel with which they are sometimes confused.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe actual date of origin of the Welsh Springer Spaniel cannot be traced, however dogs resembling the breed with its distinctive red and white coat are frequently depicted in old pictures and prints. This type of dog was known as the Land Spaniel, and is considered to be similar to the modern Welsh Springer. John Caius, writing in 1570, said \"Spaniels whose skynnes are white and if marked with any spottes they are commonly red\". It is thought that these Spaniels may have made their way into the Welsh valleys where local sportsman and hunters managed to conserve them in a pure state.At one time called the Welsh Starter, it was used to spring game, originally for hunters using falcons. The traditional red and white colour of the Welsh Springer was once also found in English dogs, but by the early 20th century any such dogs were considered to have \"died out long ago\".The Welsh Springer Spaniel was also at one time called the Welsh Spaniel, and also at one point was included in the Kennel Club (UK) studbook as Cocker Spaniels, and was known as the Welsh Cocker. During the 19th century were several different varieties of Cocker Spaniel, including the English, the Welsh and the Devonshire as the term was used to describe the size of the dog rather than the breed. Unusually, in John George Wood's 1865 book The Illustrated Natural History, an image is described showing a Welsh Cocker Spaniel as a solid coloured dark spaniel. The same inscription is used in the 1867 work The Dog in Health and Disease by Stonehenge and he further describes the Welsh Cocker and the Devonshire Cocker as \"both being of a deep-liver colour\". The Welsh Springer was relatively unknown during the 19th Century, but this changed in 1900 when Mr. A. T. Williams of Ynis-y-Gerwn won the team stake at the Sporting Spaniel Club Trials. The trials were held on Mr. Williams' own estate, and it was thought that when his team defeated eight well known teams it was because of the home advantage. This was disproved when dogs from the same kennel went on to win in successive years around the UK. His conformation show champion dog Corrin was the first Welsh Springer Spaniel to be photographed.\n\nWelsh Springers were recognised by The Kennel Club, after the breed had gained popularity, in 1902 under the new name of Welsh Springer Spaniel. Until then the breed was shown alongside the English Springer Spaniel. The Welsh Springer Spaniel was transported to America in the late 19th century and gained recognition by the American Kennel Club in 1906.World War I caused problems for the breed in the United Kingdom, and when the war was over there were no dogs whose parents had registered pedigrees. The breed restarted with the remaining unregistered dogs, and it is these dogs that formed the modern day breed. The breeders in the 1920s and 1930s developed these dogs into the type of Welsh Springer Spaniel which remains today. The Welsh Springer Spaniel Club (UK) was formed in 1923, registrations slowly increased between the wars but all records held by the breed club were destroyed in an air raid during World War II. Following the two World Wars, it was thought that no Welsh Springers remained in the United States. The breed was reintroduced, and the descendants of those dogs make up the breed today in the United States and Canada. The breed was officially imported into Australia in 1973.In 2000, The Kennel Club registered 424 Welsh Springer Spaniels, compared with 12,599 English Springer Spaniels and 13,445 English Cocker Spaniels. Numbers remained steady, with 420 Welsh Springer Spaniels being registered in 2004, however numbers of English Springer Spaniels increased to 14,765 and English Cocker Spaniels to 16,608. Numbers remain closer to the American Cocker Spaniel which registered 610 in 2000, and 599 in 2004. The breed remains more popular than some other breeds of Spaniel, including the Clumber Spaniel, Field Spaniel, Sussex Spaniel and Irish Water Spaniel. Total registrations in the UK during 2016 fell to 299 qualifying it to be included on The Kennel Club's list of Vulnerable Native Breeds.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Welsh Springer Spaniel is a compact, solidly built dog, bred for hard work and endurance. Their body can give the impression of length due to its obliquely angled forequarters and developed hindquarters. The build of the Welsh Springer Spaniel should be slightly off square, meaning that the length of the dog should be slightly greater than the height at the withers. However, some dogs may be square, and this is not penalised in the show ring as long as the height is never greater than the length.  Traditionally a docked breed, dependent on legislation in the country of origin, and where allowed the dew claws can be removed.In conformation showing, eyes should be brown in colour; yellow eyes do sometimes occur but are penalised in the show ring. Ears are small, pendulous (suspended and hanging), vine-shaped and with a light setter-like feathering. Nostrils are well developed and are black or any shade of brown; a pink nose is penalised in the AKC standard for the show ring, in Britain the colour is not specified in The Kennel Club's breed standard. In showing, a scissors bite is preferred with an undershot jaw severely penalised. Unlike the English Springer Spaniel and English Cocker Spaniel, there is no divergence into show and field styles of the breed.Male dogs are 18 to 19 inches (46 to 48 cm) high at the withers, with females a little smaller at 17 to 18 inches (43 to 46 cm). On average, members of the breed weigh between 35 to 45 lb (16 to 20 kg). The back of the legs, chest, and underside of the body are feathered, and the ears and tail are lightly feathered. The only colour is a rich red-and-white. Any pattern is acceptable and any white area may be flecked with red ticking.Welsh Springers are often confused with the English Springer Spaniel, but there are marked differences. The Welsh Springer is slightly smaller, and its reddish markings on a white background as opposed to the English Springers black or liver-coloured markings. Both breeds are admired for their hunting abilities and their trademark trait of \"springing\" at game. This can be seen during play also, as a dog may \"spring\" on his toy.  Some experts believe that the Welsh Springer Spaniel and the Brittany share the same ancestry as there is a great deal of resemblance between the two breeds. The colours of the Welsh Springer, while exclusive from the English Springer, appear in the Brittany and the Brittany and Welsh Springers are both of similar sizes. The Welsh Springer is larger than the English Cocker Spaniel.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Welsh Springer Spaniel is active, loyal, and affectionate. They may meet strangers barking when in their territory, or act aloof, cautious or wary. The breed is well known for being friendly and demonstrative to all members of the family, especially children, and accepting other pets of the household with a friendly, playful attitude.The breed is quick to learn but can be headstrong, though with correct training can become very obedient. The Welsh Springer was bred for work and endurance, and as with many breeds of hunting dogs requires a regular exercise routine to keep them healthy and content. Without adequate exercise, a Welsh Springer Spaniel may appear hyperactive. Some Welsh Springers can become clingy towards their owners and suffer separation anxiety when alone.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThe Welsh Springer is generally a healthy breed, but some can suffer conditions common to many breeds such as hip dysplasia, Canine glaucoma and like other dogs with pendulous ears, they are prone to ear infections such as otitis externa. In a survey of over a hundred breeds of dog conducted in 1997, the Welsh Springer Spaniel was ranked 14th for worst hip score, with the average score of the breed being 18.45. The average lifespan is 12 to 15 years.\n\n\n=== Eye disorders ===\nWelsh Springers can be prone to entropion, which is a disorder that affects the eyelids. The condition causes them to curl inwards, pressing the eyelashes against the surface of the eye itself and causing them to scratch it. This can lead to irritation and damage to the cornea. In most cases it only affects the lower eyelid on one or both eyes, but in some cases the upper eyelid can be affected as well. Symptoms can include tearing, squinting, the rubbing of the eyes, thick discharge from the eyes and rolling of the eyelid along with wetness on the hairs next to the eyelids. There is no medical treatment for entropion, and surgical correction may be necessary depending on the severity of the case. This condition may be present soon after birth, or later in life as a secondary condition to other eye related diseases or infections. Other breeds also affected by the condition include the Chow Chow, Great Dane, Golden Retriever and the English Springer Spaniel.Narrow/closed angle glaucoma is an autosomal dominant inheritable trait in the breed. It is a leading cause of blindness in dogs, and is where there is increased fluid pressure within the eye. If the fluid is not reduced, the pressure causes permanent damage to the retina and optic nerve. Loss of eyesight can happen as quickly as within 24 hours if the pressure if elevated enough, or slowly over time if it is only a mild elevation. The sudden, rapid elevation of pressure is more common with narrow/closed angle glaucoma which is more common to the breed than the slower open angle glaucoma. Symptoms can include redness in the eye, the eye itself looking cloudy, sensitivity to light and the dog may rub at their eye, or even rub it along other objects and carpet as the condition is moderate to extremely painful. Treatment can vary depending on the severity of the condition but if inherited glaucoma appears in one eye then it usually occurs in the other eye eventually.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHunting dog\nSporting Group\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWelsh Springer Spaniel at Curlie"}, {"id": 509, "name": "Welsh Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom, Wales", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog509", "description": "The Welsh Terrier (Welsh: Daeargi Cymreig) originates from Wales and was originally bred for hunting fox, rodents and badger, but during the last century it has mainly been bred for showing. Despite this, it has retained its terrier strength of character. The Welsh Terrier has been claimed to be the oldest existing dog breed in the UK according to research.The Welsh Terrier was a latecomer to the British show-ring (being primarily a working dog) and was not officially registered as a breed until the 19th century. It is currently on the UK Kennel Club's list of breeds that are in danger of dying out, having as few as 300 or so pups registered annually, as compared to the nation's most popular breeds that are registered in the tens of thousands each year.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe Welsh Terrier is colored tan on the head, legs and underbelly while having a black or sometimes grizzle saddle.This is not always the case with female terriers as they are sometimes a simple darker tan all over. The breed is a sturdy and compact dog of about medium size that can grow up to 15.5 in (39 cm) with a weight of 20\u201322 pounds (9.1\u201310.0 kg). The tail was usually docked until this was prohibited in the United Kingdom in 2006, being preferred in order to complete the image of a square dog, as tall as it is long. The body shape is rectangular, with an elongated, \"brick-like\" face.  This shape is formed by the whiskers and beard. With pedigrees the face can take a more oval shape and be finer boned and more distinct.\nThe hair contains two layers, an undercoat that insulates and an abrasive fur on top that protects against dirt, rain, and wind. Welsh Terriers are born mostly all black and during the first year they change the color to standard black and tan grizzle.\nThis breed does not shed  (see Moult). However, the coat requires regular maintenance including brushing and hand stripping.\nAn undocked Welsh Terrier tail is only an inch or so longer than a docked tail and does not make a great deal of difference to the overall appearance. The coat does not moult out but old hairs will eventually be stripped out through play and movement if the coat is not regularly raked. Ungroomed coats can also fade and thin out as the old hair loses colour and texture. to keep a moult free house and a good coat on your Welsh Terrier it is necessary to rake out the coat on a regular basis. Welsh terriers need some grooming. Their fur grows a little long.\nThe Welsh Terrier closely resembles a compact Airedale Terrier.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\n\nThe Welsh Terrier has a typical terrier temperament.  In the right hands, it is a happy, lively, and seldom shy or timid dog, but sometimes can have an attitude.  The Welsh Terrier is generally friendly with people and dogs but when a challenge is perceived, it will not back down.  Dogs of this breed can be devoted friends and can function either as city dogs or as country dogs.\nWelsh Terriers were developed to hunt independently and this required that they be very assertive and stoic dogs.  As a consequence, developing obedience in a Welsh Terrier is a long-term proposition and one has to constantly work on and reinforce the training.  They rank 53rd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, being of average working/obedience intelligence.  This, however, does not mean that Welsh Terriers fail to learn or understand commands, just that they tend to make their own decisions; thus the need for constant reinforcement.  When acting on their own, they are quite creative and quick in decision making. They also have the potential for excessive barking. Like other terrier breeds, the Welsh Terrier enjoys digging.\nA Welsh Terrier is full of energy and requires regular exercise. A run around the yard during the day is insufficient. They become  excited, and if bored, they may explore and potentially cause mischief and damage.  Welsh Terriers need a challenge to keep them entertained.  For example, they love chasing toys and love swimming (a good example would be lake activities with their families).\nWelsh Terriers get along well with children; they love to play and follow a child as it plays, however, and they will often tug at pant legs and can knock young ones off their feet. If they are around young children at an early age, they will easily learn to play more gently.\nAs with all breeds, it is important to socialize Welsh Terriers as early as possible to a wide range of dogs, people, and experiences.\n\n\n== Health ==\nThe body of the Welsh Terrier is normal and healthy so that the physique is durable and lasting. Some studies have suggested a genetic predisposition to primary lens luxation which results in secondary glaucoma. Onychodystrophy, a disorder of nail growth causing nails to be weak and brittle, is relatively common in the breed. A healthy Welsh Terrier lives around 12 to 13 years on average and stays active and alert up to a high age if it is well taken care of and healthy.\n\n\n=== Notable Welsh Terriers ===\nCharlie, pet of John F. Kennedy\nClement Attlee, Ist Earl Attlee, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom 1945-1951 owned a Welsh Terrier. The dog is incorporated into Earl Attlee's coat-of-arms\nGwen, Welsh Terrier pet of Edward, Prince of Wales, later King Edward VIII.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn the animated film Balto III: Wings of Change, the character of Mel is a Welsh Terrier. He is very neurotic and is voiced by Oscar-nominated actor David Paymer.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWelsh Terrier at Curlie"}, {"id": 510, "name": "West Highland White Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom, Scotland", "type": "Terrier", "picture": "dog510", "description": "The West Highland White Terrier, commonly known as the Westie, is a breed of dog from Scotland with a distinctive white harsh coat with a somewhat soft white undercoat. It is a medium-sized terrier, although with longer legs than other Scottish breeds of terrier. It has a white double coat of fur which fills out the dog's face, giving it a rounded appearance. \nThe breed is intelligent, quick to learn, and can be good with children, but does not always tolerate rough handling. The Westie is an active and intelligent breed, and is social with a high prey drive, as they were once used to hunt rodents. \nThe modern breed is descended from a number of breeding programs of white terriers in Scotland before the 20th century. Cousin to the Cairn Terrier, the Westie was bred to hunt small rodents at places such as farms. Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch, is credited with the creation of the modern breed from his Poltalloch Terrier, but did not want to be known as such. \nOther related breeds included George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll's Roseneath Terrier and Dr Americ Edwin Flaxman's Pittenweem Terriers. This breed of small white Scottish terriers was given its modern name for the first time in 1908, with recognition by major kennel clubs occurring around the same time.\nThe breed remains very popular in the UK, with multiple wins at Cruft's. It is in the top third of all breeds in the US since the 1960s. It has been featured in television and film, including in Hamish Macbeth, and in advertising by companies such as Cesar dog food and Scotch whisky Black & White. \nSeveral breed-specific and nonspecific health issues appear in the breed, including a condition in young dogs nicknamed \"westie jaw\" which causes an overgrowth of bone in the jaw of the dog. It can also be prone to skin disorders, with a breed-specific condition called hyperplastic dermatosis occurring. They are a very energetic and boisterous breed, needing regular exercise of around 1 hour per day.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nCommonly, Westies have bright, deep-set, almond-shaped eyes that are dark in colour. Their ears are pointed and erect. Members of the breed typically weigh between 15 and 20 pounds (6.8 and 9.1 kg), and the average height is between 10\u201311 inches (25\u201328 cm) at the withers. The body should be shorter than the height of the dog at the shoulder.They also have a deep chest, muscular limbs, a black nose, and a short, closely fitted jaw with \"scissors\" bite (lower canines locked in front of upper canines, upper incisors locked over lower incisors). The Westie's paws are slightly turned out to give it better grip than flat-footed breeds when it climbs on rocky surfaces. In young puppies, the nose and footpads have pink markings, which slowly turn black as they age. Westies also have short and sturdy tails. Some sources suggest that due to their history as rodent catchers, their tails were bred to be thick so that a Westie trapped in a hole could be easily pulled out by the tail.They have a soft, dense, thick undercoat and a rough outer coat, which can grow to about 2 inches (5.1 cm) long. The fur fills out the face to give a rounded appearance. As puppies develop into adults, their coarse outer coat is normally removed by either \"hand-stripping\", especially for dog-showing, or otherwise clipping.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe temperament of the West Highland White Terrier can vary greatly, with some being friendly towards children, whilst others prefer solitude. It will not typically tolerate rough handling such as a child pulling on its ears or fur, and can frequently be both food- and toy-possessive. This makes regular training from a young age of particular importance. It is normally independent, assured, and self-confident, and can make a good watchdog. It is a loyal breed that bonds with its owner, but is often always on the move, requiring good exercise (15\u201330 min). The Westie is highly social and is the most friendly and jolly of all the Scottish breeds of terriers.It is a hardy breed, and can be stubborn, leading to issues with training. A Westie may need to have its training refreshed on occasion during its lifetime. Having a typical terrier prey drive, it tends to be highly interested in toys, especially chasing balls. It does retain the instincts of an earth-dog, including inquisitive and investigative traits, as well as natural instincts to both bark and dig holes. It is ranked 47th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs.\n\n\n== Health ==\n\nThe American breed club puts the lifespan of the Westie at 12 to 16 years. A club survey puts the average lifespan at 11.4 years. Veterinary clinic data from the UK show a typical lifespan of 10.5 to 15 years. The French Kennel Club database gives 8 to 16 years, with a median of 13 years. The typical litter size is between three and five puppies.The breed is predisposed to conditions found in many breeds, such as abdominal hernias. Westie puppies may be affected by craniomandibular osteopathy, a disease also known as \"lion jaw\", and is sometimes also referred to as \"westie jaw\". The disease is an autosomal recessive condition, so a puppy can only be affected by it if both its parents are carriers of the faulty gene. The condition appears across many breeds, including several different types of terriers, as well as other unrelated breeds such as the Great Dane. It typically appears in dogs under a year old, and can cause problems for the dog to chew or swallow food. Radiographic testing can be conducted to diagnose the condition, in which the bones around the jaw thicken; additionally, the blood may show increased calcium levels and enzyme levels. The condition often stops progressing by the time the dog is a year old, and in some cases can recede. It is normally treated with anti-inflammatory medications, and the feeding of soft foods. In some cases, tube feeding may be necessary. However, if the animal still cannot eat and is in uncontrolled pain, then euthanasia may be the only medical option remaining.The breed is prone to skin disorders. About a quarter of Westies surveyed are affected by atopic dermatitis, a heritable chronic allergic skin condition. A higher proportion of males are affected compared to females. An uncommon but severe breed-specific skin condition, hyperplastic dermatosis, may affect West Highland White Terriers, both juveniles and adults dogs. Affected dogs can suffer from red hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and hair loss. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as allergies or less serious forms of dermatitis.An inherited genetic problem that exists in the breed is globoid cell leukodystrophy. It is not breed-specific, and can appear in Cairn Terriers and other breeds including Beagles and Pomeranians. It is a neurological disease where the dog lacks an enzyme called galactosylceramidase. The symptoms are noticeable as the puppy develops, and can be identified by the age of 30 weeks. Affected dogs have tremors, muscle weakness, and trouble walking. Symptoms slowly increase until limb paralysis begins to occur. Due to it being a hereditary condition, owners should avoid breeding affected animals to eliminate it from the breed. Another genetic condition that affects the breed is \"white dog shaker syndrome\". As this condition is most commonly found in Westies and Maltese, the condition was originally thought to be connected to the genes for white coats, but the same condition has since been found in other nonwhite breeds including the Yorkshire Terrier and the Dachshund. The condition typically develops over one to three days, resulting in tremors of the head and limbs, ataxia, and hypermetria. Affected males and females can be affected for different lengths of time, with symptoms in females lasting between four and six weeks, while males can be affected the rest of their lives.Other less common conditions which appear in the breed include hydroxyglutaric aciduria, which is where elevated levels of Alpha-Hydroxyglutaric acid are in the dog's urine, blood plasma, and spinal fluid. It can cause seizures, muscle stiffness, and ataxia, but is more commonly found in Staffordshire Bull Terriers. A degeneration of the hip joint, known as Legg\u2013Calv\u00e9\u2013Perthes syndrome, also occurs in the breed. However, the chances of this condition occurring are much higher in some other breeds, such as the Australian Shepherd and the Miniature Pincher. The breed is also one of the least likely to be affected by a luxating patella, where the knee cap slips out of place.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nScottish white terriers were recorded as early as during the reign of James VI of Scotland, who reigned between 1567 and 1625. The king ordered that a dozen terriers be procured from Argyll to be presented to the Kingdom of France as a gift. Sandy- and brindle-coloured dogs were seen as hardier than those of other colours, and white dogs were seen as being weak. At various times during the breed's existence, it has been considered a white offshoot of both the Scottish Terrier and the Cairn Terrier breeds.Reports of a ship from the Spanish Armada being wrecked on the island of Skye in 1588 indicated the ship carried white Spanish dogs, whose descendants were kept distinct from other breeds by Clan Donald, including the families of the Chiefs. Other families on Skye preserved both white and sandy-coloured dogs. One such family was the Clan MacLeod, and it was reported by their descendants that at least two Chiefs kept white terriers, including \"The Wicked Man\" Norman MacLeod, and his grandson Norman, who became Chief after his death.George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, chief of Clan Campbell, bred a breed of white Scottish terriers known as the \"Roseneath Terrier\". Another breed of white Scottish terriers also appeared at this point, with Dr. Americ Edwin Flaxman from Fife developing his line of \"Pittenweem Terriers\" out of a female Scottish Terrier which produced white offspring. The dog seemed to produce these white puppies regardless of the sire to which she was bred, and after drowning over 20 of these offspring, he came upon the theory that it was an ancient trait of the Scottish Terrier that was trying to reappear. He rededicated his breeding program to produce white Scottish Terriers with the aim of restoring it to the same stature as the dark-coloured breed. Flaxman is credited with classes being added to dog shows for white Scottish Terriers towards the end of the 19th century.\n\nThe person most closely associated with developing the modern breed of West Highland White Terrier is Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch. Malcolm owned terriers used to work game; the story told is that a reddish-brown terrier was mistaken for a fox and shot. Following this, Malcolm decided to develop a white terrier breed, which became known as the \"Poltalloch Terrier\". The first generation of Poltallochs had sandy-coloured coats, and had already developed prick ears, which is a trait seen later in the modern breed. It is unknown if the Poltalloch Terriers and Pittenweem Terriers were interbred. In 1903, Malcolm declared that he did not want to be known as the creator of the breed and insisted that his breed of white terriers be renamed. The term \"West Highland White Terrier\" first appears in Otters and Otter Hunting by L.C.R. Cameron, published in 1908.The first breed club was set up in 1904; Niall Campbell, 10th Duke of Argyll, was the society's first president. A second club was subsequently set up, with the Countess of Aberdeen as chairman. Edward Malcolm succeeded the Countess as the club's second chairman. Kennel Club recognition followed in 1907, and the breed appeared at Crufts for the first time in the same year. The Westie was imported into the United States in 1907\u20131908, when Robert Goelet imported Ch. Kiltie and Ch. Rumpus Glenmohr. Initially, it was also known at the time as the Roseneath Terrier, and the Roseneath Terrier Club was recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1908. The club was renamed during the following year to the West Highland White Terrier Club of America. The breed spent the period that immediately followed as being \"in vogue\", becoming popular almost immediately upon its arrival in the US. Canadian Kennel Club recognition followed in 1909. Until 1924 in the UK, Westie pedigrees were allowed to have Cairn and Scottish Terriers in them. By the time of Malcolm's death in 1930, a stable type had appeared with prick ears, a white coat, and a short back.\n\nIn major conformation shows, the breed has been equally successful on both sides of the Atlantic. The first member of the breed to win a show championship was Ch. Morvan in 1905, owned by Colin Young. The dog was registered at the time as a Scottish Terrier, and won the title at the Scottish Kennel Club show at the age of seven months. Because the breed was not yet recognised independently, the championship title was not retained when the dog was reregistered as a West Highland White Terrier. The first win at a major show came at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1942 when Constance Winant's Ch. Wolvey Pattern of Edgerstoune won the title of Best in Show. The same title was taken by Barbara Worcester's Ch. Elfinbrook Simon in 1962. It took a further 14 years before the breed took its first Best in Show title at Crufts, the UK's major dog show. Ch. Dianthus Buttons, owned by Kath Newstead and Dorothy Taylor, took the title for the breed in 1976. A Westie also won Crufts in 1990 with the Best in Show title going to Derek Tattersall's Ch. Olac Moon Pilot., and in 2016.(Burneze Geordie Girl)\nThe popularity of the breed during the early 20th century was such that dogs were being exchanged for hundreds of guineas. As of 2010, the Westie is the third-most popular breed of terrier in the UK, with 5,361 puppies registered with the Kennel Club. However, this is a decrease in numbers since 2001, when it was the most popular terrier breed, with 11,019 new dogs registered. The breed's position in the United States is more stable with it remaining in the top third of all breeds since around 1960. It was ranked 30th-most popular in 2001, based on registrations with the American Kennel Club, which has varied around the 30s in the decade since, with it ranked 34th in 2010.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n=== In public life ===\nMuhammad Ali Jinnah, founder of Pakistan, owned a Westie.\nJohn Green, novelist, co-founder of the VlogBrothers, is known to own a Westie, called Willie (or Fireball Wilson Roberts).\nJ.

Russian publications indicate that the term West Siberian Laika loosely applied to hunting dogs originating with the Mansi and Khanty people in Ural and West Siberia, but there were no standards or registrations of WSL as such until 1930. Then WWll disrupted it for a while, but systematic breeding with registrations resumed after the war ended, in 1946. This was the time the breed began taking modern shape.  Before that hunters only knew of Mansi Laika and Khanty Laika. In early 1960 many hunters in Ural still preferred the term Mansi Laika, when speaking of West Siberian Laika. In Russian language, the term Laika originated from the word layat that means to bark. The word Laika simply means barker. Any hunting Laika is a bark pointer (pointing at animal of interest by barking and staying with the animal ). It is a versatile dog depending on use and environment, but in certain parts of the country they have become more specialized.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nLaikas, occurring on Russian territory, belong to northern primitive breeds retaining traits of their wild ancestor, the wolf, in the appearance and behavior. They are dogs with pointed muzzle, slightly rangy or nearly square body and often gray or gray mixed with red like in the wolf coat color predominate. They are small to medium size pariah- type dogs that originally accompanied humans since prehistory worldwide, until they became replaced with lop-eared, specialized for certain style of hunting, cultured breeds.  In large sparser populated parts of Russia, this process came at a later time and aboriginal Laika types still remain with hunters in remote northern and northeastern provinces of the country.\n\n\n== History ==\nDeforestation of land for agriculture and industrialization in later 19th-early 20th Centuries accelerated replacement of Laikas with other popular at the time dogs. Russian experts of the late 19th century distinguished dozens of varieties of aboriginal Laikas, each associated with a particular ethnic group of indigenous people of northeastern Europe and Siberia, but none of them had been considered as purebred and pedigreed.  Russians tried to save some hunting Laikas from extinction by bringing them from different provincial parts of Russia in cities of European part of the country and breeding them pure. Starting from thirtieth and especially after WW II, they established four breeds as purebreds: the Karelo-Finnish Laika, the Russ-European Laika, the West Siberian Laika and the East Siberian Laika. They all are bark-pointing dogs and their hunting behavior is generally similar. All of them are descendants of aboriginal types of Laikas selectively sampled from large territories and lumped into the four breeds for breeding in kennels.  Among all of them, the West Siberian Laika became most popular and by present time it is most numerous Laika far beyond its original range in Russia.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe West Siberian Laika is a medium to large size dog. Males are 22-24 inches and females are 20-23 inches at the shoulder.\nThe coat of the West Siberian Laika is a double coat of harsh straight guard hairs and thick and soft undercoat. The guard hairs on the neck, around the head and shoulders are particularly long and stiff. Together with a very thick undercoat they form a ruff framing the dog's face. On the tail, the guard hair and undercoat are also longer and thicker than on the rest of the body. In wintertime, dogs living in cold climate grow hair between the toes. Although the coat quality varies individually, dogs raised in countries with cold climates have longer and thicker coats than dogs that live in warm and hot climates or dogs that are kept inside most of the time.\nMost common coat colors are wolf gray, pale red and white. The gray coat can be of various shades from almost white to very dark gray, nearly black. The gray can be mixed with red producing array of brownish and red shades. Dogs with either coat color described above may have white patches in different proportions. Pale red and white dogs may have brown noses and lips. Dogs with either coat color have so-called \"zonary\" pattern of distribution of pigment in each guard hair. This means guard hair has alternating bands (zones) of white with black, brown or red color. Hairs with evenly distributed pigment indicate an admixture of other than Laika breed.\nThe head is wedge-shaped in the form of a triangle, flat on the top and broader between ears. In the Mansi Laika, the head is more elongate with muzzle as long as the skull from eye to occiput or slightly longer. In the Khanty Laika, the head is broader and the muzzle is as long as the skull or slightly shorter. Lips are always close and lean. A full set of large teeth with a scissors bite is typical, but dogs with vice bite also occur. The standard accepts scissors bite only. In many dogs with a scissors bite at young age the bite is changing with age and becomes a vice bite by age of 5\u20136 years.\nEyes are almond-shaped, medium size, deep set and distinctly slanted. Their colors are brown to dark brown. Dogs with amber yellow and/or blue eyes rarely occur, but hunters believe that dogs with brown and dark brown eyes are better hunting dogs. According to the standard, any eye color, except brown and light brown is a fault.\nEars are always pricked and directed straight up, but their size, pointed or slightly rounded tips of ears are variable. Generally, ears of the Khanty Laika are small to medium. In the Mansi Laika, ears are medium to long. Ears can be set high and close to each other or slightly apart.\nThe tail is carried high curving over the back. Details of its structure and carriage are variable among aboriginal dogs. In majority of dogs, the tip of the tail lies on the back, but some dogs have the tip of the tail rigidly curved like a fishhook. Among aboriginal dogs, there are individuals with a sickle-shaped tail, but it is considered faulty by the modern breed standard.\nThe body is slightly longer than the height or nearly square and with well-muscled forequarters and hindquarters. Legs are straight and parallel. Front feet are directed forward or slightly east-west and hind legs are straight and in many dogs slightly cow-hocked. The breed standard rejects square body proportions, cow hocks and east-west position of front feet. The angulation at stifles is normally developed and look like in wild canids. Feet are strong, compact and elongate. Toes are strong, flexible and well arched.\n\n\n== Reproduction ==\nThe majority of females of the West Siberian Laika have one estrus per year, usually in February and March. Some females have their first estrus not fixed by a certain season. The first estrus can be at age of one to two and a half years. Russian experts do not recommend breeding Laikas until they are at least two years old. The number of puppies per litter varies from one to nine, but litters of three to seven puppies are most frequent. Females of the West Siberian Laika are good mothers and, if conditions permit, dig their own whelping dens, give birth to puppies and raise them without any assistance as soon as the food is available.\n\n\n== Character and behavior ==\nThe West Siberian Laika is a very affectionate and devoted to the master dog. The majority of them bark at strangers approaching the house. Their attitude to unfamiliar people varies individually and depending on the situation. Some dogs first bark and then wag their tails, greeting the guest and allow themselves to be petted. Many West Siberian Laikas are aloof with a strange person, avoid hands and watch him suspiciously. Some dogs become protective of the master, his family and their property. Many West Siberian Laikas accept a new owner with difficulty and need time to adjust to a new place. According to standard, aggressiveness to unfamiliar people is not typical. West Siberian Laika is highly territorial and may be aggressive to other intruding dogs of the same sex. Adult Laikas, especially males, should only hunt with dogs raised in the same household. West Siberian Laika can easily learn to leave alone farm animals and are naturally capable of telling apart wild game from domesticated animals. Cats of the same household are accepted, but stray cats will be treated like game.\n\n\n== Utilitarian qualities ==\n\nThe West Siberian Laika is primarily a hunting dog. Anyone who decides on a puppy of this breed should expect a full package of traits of a typical hunting Spitz. It is an emotional dog, very observant to the habits of its master, his mood and often can foresee his intentions. It does not hesitate to express its strong feelings by barking and other noises. \nThe West Siberian Laika is a poor kennel dog. If the dog is left alone, locked up in a small backyard or in a pen, some dogs develop a habit of barking, seemingly without a purpose. Permanently penned or fenced West Siberian Laikas attempt to dig under the fence or climb over it. Some dogs not trained to stay penned, try to bite the wires and thereby they damage their teeth. Once freed or turned loose, such a dog will be hard to control. It will run too far, chase other animals and likely get into trouble. West Siberian Laikas that are kept well exercised, busy with hunting and contacts with other dogs, animals and people, are content, obedient and never bark without a reason. Therefore, to make a happy dog and its owner, the right conditions of the environment for hunting plus time dedicated to the dog must be met.\nAll West Siberian Laikas are naturally protective against wild animals, especially predators, and some dogs are protective against strangers acting suspicious or violent. A West Siberian Laika will make a good companion dog for a hiking trip. However, its extraordinary interest in wildlife demands special attention because the dog may tree some animals and stay far behind for some time. The West Siberian Laika is a great psycho-therapy dog for able bodied active people, who are not lazy to walk a lot and hunt. He needs regular free exercising between hunting seasons. Take him for walking trips in safe places often and stay healthy.\n\nIf you have bears in the woods near you, this dog would be the best to warn you or your loved ones in time about the bear's presence and may even show you a treed bear. If a Laika sees a bear, they will run toward the bear, not from it, and they will be barking. When a Laika barks at a bear, their voice sounds as if they were barking at a human--very unlike when they are barking at a squirrel. Treeing squirrels and other small game comes naturally. Just take your puppy in woods and turn him loose. He will start finding his own squirrels by age of 4 to 10 months. Mansi, Khanty, Russians and any other ethnic groups of people living in Russia use the same dogs for hunting and as alarm dogs.\nSome West Siberian Laikas work well herding reindeer herds. During any activity or training, hunting overrules everything else. A Mansi never minds if his Laika abandons his reindeer herd for a while, especially if his Laika finds valuable game. Mansi and Khanty use reindeer and, in some cases, horses as a draft animal, but good hunting dogs are never used to pull sleds. It would be like using a valuable dagger to chop firewood. If a sled dog is needed, they use another kind sturdy built and larger dog called in Russian \"Yezdovaya Laika\" or sled Laika. This is practiced mainly in polar tundra where reindeer have nothing to eat.\n\n\n== References ==\nSources in Russian Language:\n\nDmitrieva-Sulima, M., \"Laika and Hunting With It\", Sanct-Peterburg, 1911.

The Westphalian Dachsbracke was used in Sweden to develop the Drever.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Westphalian Dachsbracke (Westf\u00e4lische Dachsbracke) is a smaller, short-legged version of the Deutsche Bracke, and very similar in size and appearance to the Drever (FCI No. 130), but 2 cm shorter (the Drever was first registered in Sweden in 1910 as the Westf\u00e4lische Dachsbracke; the name was changed in 1947.)The Westphalian Dachsbracke stands about 30 to 38 cm (12 to 15 in) high at the withers. It has medium-long drooped ears, short legs, and a long tail which is set high and carried up. The coat has short fur, usually tricolor (red to yellow with a black saddle), with white markings called Bracken marks - a white muzzle, chest, legs, collar, and tip of the tail, and a blaze on the head. The chest is more narrow than the Dachshund's chest, and the legs are longer.\n\n\n== History ==\nDogs of similar type are seen in very old European paintings, though the Westphalian Dachsbracke was first described as a variety of German Hound in 1886. It was recognized by the Verband f\u00fcr das Deutsche Hundewesen (German Kennel Club) in 1935 with its current name, and by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale as breed number 100 in Group 6 (scenthounds), Section 1.3 (small hounds). The Westphalian Dachsbracke is the ancestor breed of the Swedish scenthound, the Drever. Of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world, only the United Kennel Club in the US recognises the Westphalian Dachsbracke, in its scenthound group. The Westphalian Dachsbracke also may be recognised by any of the many minor registries, rare breed groups, hunting clubs, and internet dog registry businesses under its original name or variations on the name. Hunting use of the Westphalian Dachsbracke has been mostly supplanted by the Drever, and the Westphalian Dachsbracke is seldom seen even in its home country; purchasers of dogs represented as Westphalian Dachsbracke should research the dog's background, especially if it is registered with one of the minor clubs that require little to no documentation before accepting a dog or litter for registration.\n\n\n== Names and etymology ==\nDachs is German for badger, a term used for hunting dogs with short legs. The name Dachsbracke may reflect that the Dachsbracke dogs were bred down in size by crossbreeding long-legged Bracken with the Dachshund. Historically, the term Bracke was used in German to mean the scenthounds. Brack is an old Low German word for a coastal marsh periodically inundated by storm surges with salt water (related to the English word brackish). In Europe, scenthounds are usually separated into running hounds (free running packs, which either drive the game back to the hunter, or the hunter follows as they run, or the hunter waits until the dogs' cries communicate that game has been found and held, and then goes to that spot) or leash hounds (which follow the game or track wounded or dead game while being held on a leash by the hunter.) The Bracke are usually used as running hounds, in packs, to hunt rabbits or foxes in a type of hunt called Brackade. The Dachsbracke are used for hunting today mainly in Scandinavia and in alpine regions.\nThe  Deutsche Bracke (German Bracke, also called the German Hound, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale breed number 299) is another breed of Bracke, the first one registered as a separate breed, in 1900. The Alpenl\u00e4ndische Dachsbracke (Alpine Dachsbracke, breed number 254) is from Tyrol, in Austria. The Drever, breed number 130, is also called the Swedish Dachsbracke.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHunting dog\nHound\nScent hound\n\n\n== References =="}, {"id": 513, "name": "Wetterhoun", "country": "Netherlands", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog513", "description": "The Wetterhoun (FCI No.221, translated into English as the Frisian Water Dog) is a breed of dog traditionally used as a hunting dog for hunting small mammals and waterfowl in the province of Fryslan in the Netherlands. The name of the dog comes from the West Frisian Wetterh\u00fbn meaning \"water dog.\" Plural of Wetterhoun is Wetterhounen in Dutch. The breed may also be called the Otterhoun (not to be confused with the Otterhound) or Dutch Spaniel, although it is not a Spaniel-type dog.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Wetterhoun is a medium-sized dog between 55 and 59 centimeters (21.6-23 inches) at the withers. They weigh between 25 and 35 kilos (55 and 77 pounds). Their coat is thick and curly except for the head, ears and legs, where the coat is smoother; the water repellant coat is described as having a greasy feel. Coat colour may be solid black or brown, or black with white, or brown with white, with or without white ticking or roan marks. The texture of the coat should not be woolly, as such fur will not resist water. The ears are low set and hang flat to the head, and the  tail curls tightly over the back. The breed has an unusual, somewhat grim expression due to the shape of the eyes,  which marks it as different from other dog breeds.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe ancestral type of the Wetterhoun was developed at least 400 years ago in the Dutch province of Fryslan. The origins of the Wetterhoun are conjectured to be from Gypsy dogs, crossed with an indigenous Frisian dog, perhaps the Old Water Dog, a type  which is now extinct. Dogs of this type were kept for the difficult and dangerous hunting of fitch (Mustela putorius) and otter (Lutra lutra) in the water. The dogs were also used for retrieving waterfowl and as watch dogs. Although the dogs almost disappeared during World War II, fanciers were able to bring the breed back through careful breeding, and it is gaining in popularity.\n\nDatabases are maintained by the Nederlandse Vereniging voor Stabij- en Wetterhounen (Club for the Stabij and Wetterhoun) and De Wetterhoun Vereniging Nederland for understanding pedigrees and computing inbreeding coefficients.\nInternationally the breed is recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in the Water Dogs section of Group 8. The United Kennel Club recognises the breed in its Gundog Group. The breed is also recognized by a number of minor registries, hunting clubs, and internet-based dog registry businesses and promoted as a rare breed for those seeking an unusual pet.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThis breed is an excellent gun dog, effective as both a land and water retriever, however its strong will and natural guarding abilities make early training a requirement. The breed standard describes the breed's temperament as reserved and \"an ideal guard-dog\". though never aggressive, which makes it an excellent family-dog.\nAlthough described as \"strong willed\"  the Wetterhoun is never stubborn or wilfully disobedient. Perseverance is a much better term, because they finish what they started, whatever it takes. Imperturbable they finish what they think to be their task. \nThereby the breed is sensitive and should never be treated or trained harshly.\nBrought-up and used to children, they are tolerant to children to the point where the dog should be protected against the children instead the other way around\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSearch The Open Directory Project (DMOZ) links for clubs and information about the Wetterhoun"}, {"id": 514, "name": "Whippet", "country": "England", "type": "Sighthound and Pariah", "picture": "dog514", "description": "The Whippet (also English Whippet or Snap dog) is a dog breed of medium-size. They are a sighthound breed that originated in England, where they descended from greyhounds. Whippets today still strongly resemble a smaller greyhound. Shown in the Hound group, Whippets have relatively few health problems other than arrhythmia. Whippets also participate in dog sports such as lure coursing, agility, and flyball. The name is derived from an early 17th-century word, now obsolete, meaning \"to move briskly\".Whippets were originally greyhounds that were deemed unsuitable for hunting because of their size. They were returned to their peasant breeders after being maimed so that they could not be used to hunt and break the forest law. These maimed dogs were bred together and used to catch rats, and hunt rabbits. When the forest law was repealed, these \"miniature greyhounds\" became popular in the sport of dog racing. This has led to Whippets being described as \"the poor man's racehorse.\" They are still frequently used as racing dogs today, as they have the highest running speed of breeds their weight: 35 miles per hour (56 km/h) and even challenge greyhounds for top speed. Whippets are, however, the fastest accelerating dog in the world.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nWhippets were bred to hunt by sight, coursing game in open areas at high speeds. One can find numerous representations of small greyhound-like hounds in art dating back to Ancient Egyptian times. Pharaohs bred a small sighthound dog related to the greyhound to keep in their palaces, and this dog may be the ancestor of today's Whippets.  In medieval England, a small greyhound breed became popular for use as a ratting dog. The first written English use of the word whippet with regard to a type of dog was in 1610. However, the first dog to be called a Whippet was actually a greyhound-spaniel cross and has little to do with the modern Whippet.The original whippets were thought to be English Greyhounds that were too small for stag hunting in the forests of England. These dogs were frequently returned to their breeders, who were usually peasants and as such could not own hunting dogs under the forest law. Because of this, dogs returned to them were maimed, usually by cutting a tendon in a leg or removing the toes on one paw. The breeders kept these dogs and continued to breed them, producing a smaller version of a greyhound that was suited for rat catching and hunting hares and rabbits. When the forest law was repealed, the \"small greyhounds\" became immensely popular.  Whippets were then commonly known as \"snap dogs\" for their tendency to \"snap up\" nearby prey. In the picture by Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1686\u20131755) of two dogs presented to Louis XV, they are either whippets or small greyhounds, but are probably related to an early form of whippet. Oudry also painted a second painting of Misse with a different, non-sighthound dog. There is a 1758 painting by Pompeo Batoni entitled Portrait of Charles Compton, 7th Earl of Northampton which features a similar whippet-like dog.In the nineteenth century, Whippet racing was a major sport in England. The Whippet was held in high regard in the northern parts of England and Wales, but was generally disregarded in the rest of the country. At the time, there were two varieties of Whippet. The first type had a smooth coat, was more popular in Lancashire, Yorkshire, and the Midlands, and became the modern Whippet. The other had a rough coat from crossbreeding with Bedlington Terriers, was more popular in Durham and Northumberland and was frequently referred to as a \"rabbit dog\". Early specimens were taken from the race track by the dog fanciers of the time and exported around the world. John Taylor said that \"In all the shapes and forms of dogges; of all which there are but two sorts that are useful to man's profits, which two are the mastiffe and the little curre, whippet, or house-dogge; all the rest are for pleasure and recreation.\"The age of the modern Whippet dawned in 1891 when The Kennel Club granted the breed official recognition, thus making the Whippet eligible for competition in dog shows, and commencing the recording of their pedigrees. In the United States, the Whippet was recognised in 1888 by the American Kennel Club. Whippets arrived in the United States with mill operators from England, and the first populations were established in Massachusetts. The Whippet is the 55th most popular breed according to the American Kennel Club.In 1964, Ch. Courtenay Fleetfoot of Pennyworth won best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. In 1992, Pencloe Dutch Gold won best in show at Crufts, a Whippet known as Cobyco Call the Tune won in 2004 and in 2018 the award was achieved by Ch Collooney Tartan Tease. In 2011, GCh. Starline's Chanel, a female Whippet, was chosen as the hound Show Dog of the Year by the Westminster Kennel Club.\n\n\n== Racing ==\n\nDog racing was originally an extension of hare coursing. Whippets began to be bred to race in the mid-nineteenth century. The first form of the sport was a rudimentary form of coursing known as 'ragging', and dogs who participated were said to be 'trained to the rag'. Dogs were kept on a leash by a person known as a slip, who was frequently also the race judge. The slip would release the dogs from their collars at the same time, and they would race towards their owners, who were standing at the opposite end of the track waving towels.Whippet rags were a popular Sunday event in the north and Midlands at the time. There were also international events; in Australia, at a track known as Gurney's Paddock, there were races of more than 300 whippets every Saturday, and three nights a week at the White City track. Eventually, the sport evolved and dogs were divided into four groups: those who hunted rabbits, which was not governed by rules; those who coursed hare, for which a set of rules was established; those trained to the rag; and those trained to chase a mechanical lure in a fashion similar to greyhound races. Few of the Whippets of any of the four types were purebred, as maintaining a purebred bloodline was not considered as important as breeding dogs that could win races. Many racing dogs were part terrier, part Greyhound, or part Lurcher.In 1967, the British Whippet Racing Association was established to bring around reform and consistency in race rules and procedures for races involving non-purebred Whippets. A year later, viewing the non-purebred dogs as a threat, the Whippet Club Racing Association was established exclusively for purebred animals.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\nWhippets are a medium-sized dog weighing from 15 to 42 pounds (6.8 to 19.1 kg). There are two height ranges for Whippets, depending on whether or not the dog is being shown in North America. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale and The Kennel Club both call for heights of 18.5 to 20 inches (47 to 51 cm) for males and 17.5 to 18.5 inches (44 to 47 cm) for females. Whippets tend to be somewhat larger in the United States and Canada as the American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club standards are larger; 18.5 to 22.5 inches (47 to 57 cm) for males, and 17.5 to 21.5 inches (44 to 55 cm) for females. Because colour is considered immaterial in judging Whippets, they come in a wide variety of colours and marking patterns, everything from solid black to solid white, with red, fawn, brindle, blue, or cream.  The coat is short, smooth and close.\nThey are the fastest dog of their weight, capable of achieving speeds of 35 miles per hour (56 km/h). This is due to their ability (unique, amongst dogs, to sighthounds) to run in a double suspension gallop. This gait results in four of the dog's legs being off the ground twice in each stride, once when the legs are completely extended and again when they are tucked under the body.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nWhippets are quiet and not prone to barking, but require regular exercise. They are generally gentle dogs and may be content to spend much of the day resting. The AKC describes them as \"quiet and dignified in their owner's living room\" and says they make \"excellent house dogs.\" Whippets have been called a \"poor man's racehorse\" by the colliers in Lancashire and Yorkshire.Despite being bred for racing, Whippets can be couch potatoes. When not running around, they are usually asleep or cuddled in their owner's lap. They are not prone to fighting but have been known to chase small pets, due to their sighthound nature. They also have a tendency to get up on furniture. Whippets are touch sensitive, meaning that they tend to jump or overreact when touched unexpectedly. Whippets are intelligent and can perform a number of tricks such as going in the fountain on command.\n\n\n== Health ==\nWhippets course, work, and race; they have been bred for these jobs for years. This has kept them a structurally sound breed which is predominantly free from the physical exaggerations that can lead to certain health problems. Whippets are, like other sighthounds, intolerant of barbiturate anaesthetics. This is in part due to their low concentration of body fat and their liver's inability to metabolise the anaesthetics.Given proper nutrition, exercise, and veterinary care, most Whippets live for 12 to 15 years. A UK breed survey puts the median lifespan at 12 years 10 months.  They are generally healthy, and are not prone to the frequent ear infections, skin allergies, or digestive problems that can afflict other breeds. Genetic eye defects, though quite rare, have been noted in the breed. Because of this, the American Whippet Club recommends that breeders test for this defect in their breeding stock. Hip dysplasia is rare in Whippets, with only 1.2% of 161 evaluations performed by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals being determined as dysplasic.The heart of a Whippet is large and slow beating, often being arrhythmic or even intermittent when the animal is at rest. This sometimes causes concern to the owner, or to the vet not experienced with the breed. Whippets will, however, demonstrate a regular heartbeat during exercise. In a health survey conducted by The Kennel Club cardiac problems were shown to be the second leading cause of mortality in Whippets.A 2007 study identified a myostatin mutation particular to Whippets that is significantly associated with their athletic performance. Whippets with a single copy of this mutation are generally very fast; those with two copies have disproportionately large musculature and are known as \"bully whippets\". These bully whippets experience no significant health problems beyond those experienced by a normal whippet, but may be more prone to muscle cramping. The mutation has not been seen in Greyhounds or other sighthound breeds, or in heavily muscled dogs such as Bullmastiffs, Bulldogs, Rottweilers or American Staffordshire Terriers.\n\n\n== Whippets in literature ==\nJim the whippet played a central role in a trilogy of canal travel books by Terry Darlington. Described as a 'narrow dog' he lent his name to the book's titles - Narrow Dog to Carcassonne, Narrow Dog to Indian River and Narrow Dog to Wigan Pier.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Whippet at Wikimedia Commons"}, {"id": 515, "name": "White Shepherd", "country": "United States", "type": "Herding Dog", "picture": "dog515", "description": "The White Shepherd emerged from white-coat lines of the German Shepherd dog in Canada and the United States and from European imports. \nThe German Shepherd and the white German Shepherd are the same dog, though their coat colors vary. \nThe White Shepherd breed was officially recognized by the United Kennel Club on April 14, 1999.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn German Shepherds, the recessive gene for white coat hair was cast in the breed gene pool by the late 19th and early 20th century breeding program that developed and expanded the German Shepherd Dog breed in Germany. A white herding dog named Greif was the grandfather of Horand von Grafrath, the dog acknowledged as the foundation of all contemporary German Shepherd bloodlines.\nInformation provided in early books on the German Shepherd make mention of Greif and other white German herding dogs, with upright ears and a general body description that resembles modern German Shepherd Dogs, shown in Europe as early as 1882. The early 20th century German Shepherd breeding program extensively line bred and inbred \"color coat\" dogs that carried Greif's recessive gene for \"white coats\" to refine and expand the population of early German Shepherd Dogs. White coats were made a disqualification in the German Shepherd Dog Club of Germany breed standard in 1933 after the breed club came under the control of the German Nazi party that took over all aspects of German society in February 1933 when Adolf Hitler declared a state of emergency. The German breed standard remained unchanged as German breeders repopulated the breed in the years after the conclusion of WWII.\nIn 1959 the German Shepherd Dog Club of America (GSDCA) adopted the exclusively colored breed standard of the parent German breed club. White-coated German Shepherd Dogs were officially barred from competition in the American Kennel Club conformation ring in the United States starting in 1968. AKC-registered white German Shepherd Dogs may still compete in performance events.\nDuring 1969, white dog fanciers in the United States and Canada formed their own \"White German Shepherd\" breed clubs, breeding and showing their dogs at small specialty dog shows throughout North America.\nThe White Shepherd Club of Canada (WSCC) has been dedicated to the promotion and preservation of the White Shepherd since 1971. Originally formed as a Chapter of the White German Shepherd Dog Club of America, the club was renamed White Shepherd Club of Canada in 1973. Its first conformation show was held that year with 8 dogs entered and 25 people in attendance.\nIn Canada, the Canadian Kennel Club (CKC) is incorporated under the Animal Pedigree Act, a federal statute under the auspices of the Ministry of Agriculture, which is the governing body that sets down recognition and standards for all pure animal breeds. For a long time, Agriculture Canada had protected white German Shepherds from the many attempts by the German Shepherd Dog Club of Canada to have white dogs disqualified from the CKC conformation ring, as had long been the case in the USA. Some brave members of WSCC had shown in the CKC breed rings and had even accumulated points toward their dogs' CKC Championships. That all changed in 1998, when the color white was officially disqualified from the CKC German Shepherd breed standard.\n\nDisappointed but undeterred, the WSCC continues to work toward full breed recognition of the White Shepherd as a separate breed with the CKC. The club hosts shows several times a year, often in combination with the American White Shepherd Association. Event dates and locations are published in the club's newsletter and on its web site.\nIn September 1995, a small group of fanciers of the white-coated German Shepherd Dog established the American White Shepherd Association (AWSA), a new club to advance, promote and protect the White Shepherd breed in the United States. In cooperation with the White Shepherd Club of Canada, AWSA wrote and published a new breed standard, and eventually petitioned the American Kennel Club for full recognition as a unique pure breed, separate from and independent of the German Shepherd Dog. As of this writing, AKC has not granted recognition or registration for the White Shepherd breed, but the breeders, fanciers and members of AWSA carry on with independently-held club activities as well as running and maintaining the private club registry. AWSA continues to negotiate with the AKC for breed recognition as well as with the German Shepherd Dog Club of America (GSDCA) for breed separation. Until such time as GSDCA can be persuaded to grant official release of the white dogs, AKC must continue to register all white German Shepherd Dogs born from two AKC-registered German Shepherd parents as German Shepherd Dogs.\nIn 1999, a group of AWSA members organized and established the United White Shepherd Club (UWSC) as a United Kennel Club affiliated parent club. They immediately petitioned for a new White Shepherd breed classification within UKC. The United Kennel Club accepted the UWSC's petition and created a new and separate White Shepherd breed conformation standard and registry. The White Shepherd breed was officially recognized by UKC on April 14, 1999. Today, United Kennel Club recognizes both the White Shepherd breed standard as well as the original German Shepherd Dog breed conformation standard where white and colored dogs continue to be considered together as one breed.\nNeither UKC- nor AWSA-registered White Shepherds can be registered as FCI White Swiss Shepherd Dogs (Berger Blanc Suisse). Breed clubs associated with each of these unique breed lines maintain their own breed standards for appearance and temperament. The breed \"appearance\" standard given below is appropriate to the UKC-registered White Shepherd Dog and, with a few very minor changes - mostly in wording and layout - to the written standard of the AWSA club as well.\nNo matter which country they hail from, White Shepherds excel in performance events such as competition obedience and rally obedience, tracking, flyball and agility. Many fine dogs have also earned titles in herding, proving that the herding instinct and ability has been retained in this versatile breed.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe White Shepherd is a direct descendant of the German Shepherd Dog and the two breeds share common roots and are similar in appearance. However, the White Shepherd evolved from a continuous selection for a working companion dog with that exclusive color, beauty and elegance as seen both standing and in motion. Its high degree of intelligence and sense of loyalty have allowed it to become one of the most versatile working dogs (as well as pets) in existence.The White Shepherd, as recognized by UKC, is a medium-sized, well-balanced, muscular dog, slightly longer than tall, with a medium length, pure white coat, erect ears, and a low-set natural tail that normally reaches to the hock and is carried in a slight curve like a saber. The White Shepherd is solid without bulkiness and should be shown in lean, hard physical condition. The outline of the White Shepherd is made up of smooth curves rather than angles. When trotting, the White Shepherd moves with a long, efficient stride that is driven by a powerful forward thrust from the hindquarters. The rear leg, moving forward, swings under the foreleg and touches down in the place where the forefoot left an imprint. Sex differences are readily apparent. The male breeds frame is often much larger than its female counterpart.\nThe White Shepherd should be evaluated as an all-around working dog, and exaggerations or faults should be penalized in proportion to how much they deviate from breed type and how much they interfere with the dog's ability to work.\nThe head is proportional to the size of the dog. Males appear masculine without coarseness, and females feminine without being overly fine. The skull and muzzle are of equal length, parallel to one another, and joined at a moderate stop. There is little or no median furrow.\n\nThe White Shepherd has a weather-resistant double coat. The outer coat is dense, straight, harsh, and close lying. The undercoat is short, thick, and fine in texture. At the neck, the coat may be slightly longer and heavier, particularly in males. Ideal coat color is a pure white. Colors ranging from a very light cream to a light biscuit tan are acceptable but not preferred.\nIt is a disqualification for dogs to have noses not predominantly black.\nThe tail is set on low in a natural extension of the sloping croup. The tail extends at least to the hock joint and usually below.\nThe appearance standard for United Kennel Club registered dogs is very similar to but not exactly the same as for other separate breed lines such as the AWSA-registered White Shepherd or the FCI internationally recognized Berger Blanc Suisse (White Swiss Shepherd Dog). While all of the existing breed lines have a common genetic heritage with the white-coated members of the German Shepherd Dog breed, they are each separately registered with their respective clubs or registries which also maintain the individual breed appearance standards.\nWhite Shepherds are often known to constant heavy shedding.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\nThe White Shepherd has a distinct personality marked by self-confidence. The breed is poised, but when the situation demands, they are eager, alert and ready to serve in any capacity. White Shepherds demonstrate both herding and protective instincts. With those they know, the White Shepherd is open and friendly. With strangers, they are observant and may be somewhat aloof but not apprehensive.  They enjoy running, swimming, playing fetch or any activity with their human family. This is a joyful, active, intelligent and easy to train working dog with the ability to adapt and integrate to all kinds of social events and situations. Timidity in a mature dog or aggressive behavior is not typical of this breed. White Shepherds are very loyal and tend to be especially protective of the young of various species. Although personality is dependent on the dog, it's common for them to be whiny yet very clever and persistent. With their playful and curious personalities, they make wonderful companions although some do have the tendency toward being quite vocal by exhibiting whining, grunting, moaning and sometimes howling.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nThe White Shepherd can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, Rally obedience, Schutzhund, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. White Shepherds that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\n\n== Genetics ==\n\nThere are many misconceptions about white-coat German Shepherd Dogs and the gene that expresses for their coat color. Clarence C. Little's The Inheritance of Coat Color in Dogs hypothesized that dilution or partial albinism ce, ca and cch alleles of the so-called (C) gene caused the cream and white coat color variants in domestic dogs. Little's hypothesized partial albinism explanation for cream and white colored coats has been applied across most domestic dog breeds, including white coat dogs from German Shepherd breed lines, since Little first published his book.\nHowever, comparative analysis of the dog genome and specific breed DNA sequences now shows that Little's hypothesized gene (C) color dilution explanation for cream and white colored coats is most likely not a relevant determinant of cream and white coats known to commonly occur in many dog breeds. Little's 1957-era partial albinism dilution explanation, as applied to explain domestic dog white and cream coat colors, can be replaced by the findings of modern genetic research.\nResearch has shown that a recessive e allele at the Extension (E) gene is at least partially responsible for cream and white coat color. The (E) gene, now identified as the Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene, is one of the two genes known to code for alleles that are absolutely fundamental to the formation of all German Shepherd Dog colored coat variations. When the recessive allele is inherited from each breeding pair parent, the e/e genotype offspring of certain breeds, including white coat dogs from German Shepherd breed lines, always have cream or white colored coats.White Shepherds were once blamed for color dilution or paling for the entire breed because the recessive e allele of the MC1R (E) gene locus masks expression of alleles at other gene loci that actually do code for lighter (often termed as diluted or pale) colors of silver, black and tan or liver. German breeders of the 1920s and 1930s misinterpreted pale-colored offspring of white dogs as an undesirable \"white\" genetic trait. A homozygous dog of normal color paired with a white GSD always produces full colored puppies because the e allele is recessive.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Animals portal\n Dogs portal\n Germany portal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further information ==\nNeufeld, Peter (1970).

It is sometimes considered to be Dutch in ancestry, due to the nationality of the breed founder, Eduard Karel Korthals.  History records the progression of the development of the breed through Biebeshein am Rhen Germany where the founder established the Ipenwoud kennel and the breed type was established and then into France where it is now recognized.  Others consider the Griffon to be a German breed because Korthals' kennel, Ipenwoud, was located in Biebesheim am Rhein, Germany.  It was there for over twenty years that Korthals dedicated his life to the development  and perfection of the Korthals Griffon.\nThe breed is still relatively rare in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom despite long recognition by their respective national kennel clubs, as well as the FCI (Federation Cynologique Internationale).  The Korthals Griffon is particularly adapted for hunting in thick undergrowth and around water, where its harsh coat is excellent protection.  The griffon is used primarily as a hunting dog for upland game birds as well as waterfowl.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nThe Korthals Griffon is a strong medium-sized dog (20-22\" for females, 22-24\" for males) with a harsh, wiry outer coat and a softer under coat.  The coat is preferably steel gray with brown markings.  Other acceptable colors: chestnut brown, white and brown, roan, and white and orange. All brown, all white or white and orange are less desirable.  A black coat disqualifies.The griffon has a large and long head, with large rounded eyes covered with eyebrows and complemented with a beard.  The nose is always brown.  The neck is long and body well proportioned and muscular.  Depending on the country, the tail may be docked.\n\n\n== History ==\nEduard Karel Korthals is credited with the breed around 1873. Korthals' dream was to create the ideal versatile gun dog; one with extreme resiliency, vigor, and devotion to its master.  The dog would also have to work close to its master, and be open to training.\nKorthals' breeding line began in 1874 with \"Mouche\", who would be used as its foundation bitch, as well as five other dogs described as \"Griffons\": Janus, Satan, Banco, Hector, and Junon.  He interbred the dogs carefully until offspring were produced that resembled his idea of an ultimate hunting dog.  In any event, the resulting offspring (Moustache I, Lina, and Querida) are referred to as the \"Korthals Patriarchs\" because they are the Griffon's direct ancestors.  In 1888 the first \"griffon club\" was formed as an international organization with local clubs in Bavaria \"Southern German Griffon Clue\" in 1895, in Belgium the \"Royal Belgium Griffon Club\" (1895) in France \"French Wirehaired Griffon Club (1901) soon followed.\nThe American Kennel Club's first registered Korthals Griffons (called Wirehaired Pointing Griffon in the USA) was \"Zolette\", who was entered into the stud book in 1887.  However, the Griffon was still relatively unknown, and she was registered as a \"Russian Setter (Griffon)\" for her presumed Russian heritage.  It was not until 1916, twenty-nine years later, that the breed was officially recognized as the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon in the United States.  In that same year, sixteen Griffons appeared in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, one of the most prestigious shows in the country.  Since then, the breed has grown in popularity as not only a show dog but also a versatile gun dog, Korthals' original intention for the breed.  For the most part, the breed still resembles his original intentions: a medium size, harsh coat, good degree of trainability, and resilient on the field and in the ring.\n\n\n== Health and temperament ==\nKorthals Griffons are known as intelligent with softer temperaments but with a willingness to please. They do not adapt well to harsh training methods.  Most Griffons do not take well to living their lives in kennels.  Regular exercise and training is highly recommended.  They are extremely people oriented and prefer to be somewhere in the vicinity of their owners.  The breed organizations recommend purchasing from breeders providing health clearances on written contracts on their guarantees.  Recent research had discovered the infusion of another breed into the Griffon worldwide.  This has caused a split in most countries between those individuals wishing to retain the genuine Korthals Griffon with the clubs recognizing all breedings including the outcross hybrids.\n\n\n== Shedding ==\nContrary to some publications, the Griffon is not non-shedding.  However, it does shed considerably less than many other breeds. All dogs shed, and it is the dog's dander and saliva that trigger most allergic reactions. Allergists do recognize that at times a particular allergy patient will be able to tolerate a particular dog, but they agree that \"the luck of the few with their pets cannot be stretched to fit all allergic people and entire breeds of dogs.\" Allergists \"think there really are differences in protein production between dogs that may help one patient and not another\", meaning that some allergic people may not have allergic reactions to a specific dog.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPointing breed\nGerman Wirehaired Pointer\nCesky Fousek, also known as the Bohemian Wirehaired Pointing Griffon\nHypoallergenic dog breed\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInternational Korthals Griffon Association\nAmerican Wirehaired Pointing Griffon Association\nUnited Kingdom information \nFrench Club \nDutch Club \nHealth & Genetics portal for the breed\nHealth & Genetics portal for the breed"}, {"id": 517, "name": "Wirehaired Vizsla", "country": "Hungary", "type": "Gun Dog", "picture": "dog517", "description": "The Wirehaired Vizsla ( VEESH-l\u0259; Hungarian: [\u02c8vi\u0292l\u0252]; English plural: Vizslas or sometimes Vizslak, based on the Hungarian plural vizsl\u00e1k [\u02c8vi\u0292la\u02d0k]), is a dog breed originating in Hungary.

The outline of the body is not to be hidden by the longer coat. Pronounced eyebrows along with a strong, harsh beard, 0.75 to 1.25 in (1.9 to 3.2 cm) long on both sides of the muzzle reinforce the determined expression. The coat should never be long, soft, silky, shaggy, crinkle, wooly, thin, lacking undercoat or lacking brushes on the legs.\n\n\n==== Size ====\nMales\nHeight: 23 to 25 in (58 to 64 cm).\nWeight: 55 to 65 lb (25 to 29 kg)\nFemales\nHeight: 21 to 24 in (54 to 60 cm)\nWeight: 45 to 55 lb (20 to 25 kg)Overall symmetry and balance are more important than mere measurable size.\n\n\n=== Temperament ===\nLike the Vizsla, Wirehaired Vizslas are very high energy, gentle-mannered, loyal, caring, and highly affectionate. They quickly form close bonds with their owners, including children. They are quiet dogs, only barking if necessary or if they are provoked.\nThey are natural hunters with an excellent ability to take training. Not only are they great pointers, but they are excellent retrievers as well. They will retrieve on land and in the water, making the most of their natural instincts. However, they must be trained gently and without harsh commands or strong physical correction, as they have sensitive temperaments and can be easily damaged if trained too harshly (Gottlieb, 1992). Vizslas are excellent swimmers and often swim in pools if one is available. Like all gun dogs, Vizslas require a good deal of exercise to remain healthy and happy. Thirty minutes to an hour of exercise daily in a large off-leash area is optimal (Coffman 1992).\nThe Wirehaired Vizsla thrives on attention, exercise, and interaction. It is highly intelligent, and enjoys being challenged and stimulated, both mentally and physically. Vizslas that do not get enough attention and exercise can easily become destructive or hyperactive. Under-stimulated Vizslas may also become depressed or engage in obsessive-compulsive behaviours such as persistent licking (Coffman 1992). Vizslas are very gentle dogs that are great around children. The Vizsla wants to be close to its owner as much of the time as possible. Many Vizslas will sleep in bed with their owners if allowed, burrowing under the covers.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe less usual Wirehaired Vizsla is a completely separate breed from its more commonly seen smooth-coated cousin. The Wirehaired Vizsla was developed in the 1930s, initially by Vasas Jozsef, owner of the Csabai vizsla kennel along with Gresznarik Laszlo, who owned the de Selle German Wirehaired Pointer kennel. Their aim was to produce a dog that combined the color of the Vizsla with a heavier coat, and a more substantial frame, better suited for working in cold weather and retrieving from icy water.\nTwo Vizsla bitches (Zsuzsi and Csibi), both of whom combined excellent pedigrees with good working ability, were selected to breed with a totally liver colored German Wirehaired Pointer sire (Astor von Potat). Zsuzsi\u2019s sire was known to have offspring with longer coats. The best of Zsuzsi\u2019s and Csibi\u2019s offspring were selected and bred together and Dia de Selle, the first WHV to be exhibited, was born. She had the same body as the shorthaired vizsla, but her head was the shape of the German Wirehaired Pointer. While her coat was not rough and thick enough, she was the promising beginning of the creation of the new breed.\nAnecdotal history suggests the added infusion of Pudelpointer, Bloodhound and Irish Setter blood during the period of the Second World War when many other Hungarian kennels became involved in the development of the breed. It has also previously, but incorrectly been suggested that the breed was created by backbreeding of smooth Vizsla's most heavily coated offspring (Gottlieb, idem).\nThere are approximately 400-450 Wirehaired Vizslas in the US and between 2,500 and 3,000 worldwide.\n\n\n=== Official recognition ===\nThe Wirehaired Vizsla was recognized in Europe by the FCI under the Hungarian standard in 1986.\nIntroduced to North America in the 1970s, the breed was first recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club in 1977 and North American Versatile Hunting Dog Association in 1986. The breed was recognized by the United Kennel Club in 2006.\nIt was recognized by the Australian National Kennel Council in 2007.\nThe breed was admitted into AKC's Foundation Stock Service Program in 2008. Effective January 1, 2009, the Wirehaired Vizsla became eligible to compete in AKC Companion and Performance events. The Wirehaired Vizsla was permitted to show in conformation in the AKC Miscellaneous Class starting January 1, 2011. They joined the Sporting Group and became a fully recognized breed on July 2, 2014.They are also recognized by in North America by the American Rare Breed Association, as well as Field Dog Stud Book registries.\n\n\n== Common illnesses ==\nAlthough the Wirehaired Vizsla is not generally considered as a sickly dog, breeding from a small number of dogs has led to heritable illnesses in some offspring, including:\n\ndysphagia-megaesophagus (difficulty swallowing, drooling and muscle wasting)\nhip dysplasia\nhypothyroidism\nsebaceous adenitis\ndigestive problems (including intolerance to certain foods or food allergies)\neye conditions such as:\nectropion (the upper or lower eyelid curls outward which gives the look of \"droopy eyes\")\nentropion (the upper or lower eyelid, but in most cases the lower lid, curls inward towards the eye, therefore irritating the cornea)\nidiopathic epilepsy is becoming more common in this breed (Gottlieb 2002)Responsible breeders do not select dogs for breeding if they have such inherent problems.\n\n\n== See also ==\nVizsla, a breed that contributed to the original development of the Wirehaired Vizsla.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWirehaired Vizsla Club of America, (US National/Parent Breed Club est. 2003)\nOverview of the Hungarian Wire-Haired Vizsla (by Complete Dogs Guide)\nHungarian Wirehaired Vizsla Association (UK)"}, {"id": 518, "name": "Xiasi Dog", "country": "China", "type": "", "picture": "dog518", "description": "Xiasi Dog (also known as Xiasi Quan or Bai Long Quan) is a breed of dog originating from Guizhou Province in China, recognised by the Chinese Kennel Club. Since the breed is mainly raised in the town of Xiasi, Kaili city, the official name for this breed is Xiasi Quan, though members of the Miao ethnic group also refer to this breed as Bai Long Quan.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nXiasi Quan have distinctive characteristics and traits which make them ideal hunting dogs. Their lean muscular bodies, padded paws, and powerful legs are bred to follow fast and agile prey.\nIn southern area of Guizhou, Xiasi Quan are often trained as guard dogs.  Xiasi Quan possess a keen sense of smell, as well as impressive speed and stamina. Xiasi dogs are very loyal and affectionate to their owners.\nAn adult individual weighs from 22 to 66 pounds, with a height ranging from 17 to 20 inches. It has a short, wiry, white-coloured pelt, a large face with pointed ears, small eyes and a wide mouth. The dog's skin appears red around its nose, mouth and ears.{{}}\n\n\n== Breed ==\nThe breed, which is named after the village of Xiasi, prefecture of Kaiili, is now accepted in most Chinese dog shows, if not by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale.\n{{}}\n\n\n== Habits ==\nInitially, the original purpose of the Xiasi Quan breed was for household protection and hunting. The breed's innate intelligence and agility made them effective hunters, so the Xiasi dog was primarily used for hunting after the 90s. The Xiasi Dog has a kind temperament towards owners, and cooperates well under human guidance.\n\n\n== History ==\nXiasi Quan and people in Guizhou have been living together for a long period of time. In Guizhou, the Xiasi Dog is respected by people due to the belief that the dog brings wealth to family. This is thought to have originated in 1080, when Xiasi Dog was trained to hunt animals to trade.\n\n\n== Popularity ==\nThe Xiasi Quan has an adaptive nature and is easy to raise and train. In 2013 it was ranked #3 in a competition for world-renowned  dog breeds.\nIn the Chinese Province of Guizhou, Xiasi dogs are bred to fight boars in competitions. Each bout lasts three minutes with the dogs being judged on their willingness to attack as well as the number of attacks made. Many of these competitions have upwards of 100 dogs competing at any one gathering.\n\n\n== Relevant news ==\nThe Xiasi Quan dog breed is on the verge of extinction. It is estimated that in the origin of the breed; Majiang County, Guizhou Province, the number of purebred Xiasi dogs is only about 270 individuals.\n\n\n== Notes =="}, {"id": 519, "name": "Yorkshire Terrier", "country": "United Kingdom, England", "type": "Companion Dog", "picture": "dog519", "description": "The Yorkshire Terrier is a small dog breed of terrier type, developed during the 19th century in Yorkshire, England. Ideally its maximum size is 7 pounds (3.2 kg). A popular companion dog, the Yorkshire Terrier has also been part of the development of other breeds, such as the Australian Silky Terrier. It has a grey, black and tan coat, and the breed's nickname is Yorkie.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Yorkshire Terrier (also called a \"Yorkie\") originated in Yorkshire, a county in northern England (and the adjoining Lancashire). In the mid-19th century, workers from Scotland came to Yorkshire in search of work and brought with them several different varieties of small terriers. Breeding of the Yorkshire Terrier was \"principally accomplished by the people\u2014mostly operatives in cotton and woollen mills\u2014in the counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire.\" Details are scarce. Mrs A. Foster is quoted as saying in 1886, \"If we consider that the mill operatives who originated the breed...were nearly all ignorant men, unaccustomed to imparting information for public use, we may see some reason why reliable facts have not been easily attained.\"The breed comes from three different dogs, a male named Old Crab, a female named Kitty, and another female whose name is not known. The Paisley Terrier, a smaller version of the Skye Terrier that was bred for a beautiful long silky coat, also figured into the early dogs. Some authorities believed that the Maltese was used as well. \"They were all originally bred from Scotch Terriers (note: meaning dogs from Scotland, not today's Scottish Terrier) and shown as such...the name Yorkshire Terrier was given to them on account of their being improved so much in Yorkshire.\" Yorkshire Terriers were shown in a dog show category (class) at the time called \"Rough and Broken-coated, Broken-haired Scotch and Yorkshire Terriers\". Hugh Dalziel, writing in 1878, says that \"the classification of these dogs at shows and in the Kennel Club Stud Book is confusing and absurd\" in lumping together these different types.In the early days of the breed, \"almost anything in the shape of a Terrier having a long coat with blue on the body and fawn or silver coloured head and legs, with tail docked and ears trimmed, was received and admired as a Yorkshire Terrier\". But in the late 1860s, a popular Paisley type Yorkshire Terrier show dog named Huddersfield Ben, owned by a woman living in Yorkshire, Mary Ann Foster, was seen at dog shows throughout Great Britain, and defined the breed type for the Yorkshire Terrier.\n\n\n=== Huddersfield Ben ===\n\nHuddersfield Ben was a famous dog. His portrait was painted by George Earl and in 1891 an authority on the breed wrote, \"Huddersfield Ben was the best stud dog of his breed during his lifetime, and one of the most remarkable dogs of any pet breed that ever lived; and most of the show specimens of the present day have one or more crosses of his blood in their pedigree.\" A show winner, Huddersfield Ben quickly became the type of dog everyone wanted, and through his puppies has defined the breed as we know it today. He is still referred to as \"father of the breed.\"\n\n\n=== In North America ===\n\nThe Yorkshire Terrier was introduced in North America in 1872 and the first Yorkshire Terrier was registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885. During the Victorian era, the Yorkshire Terrier was a popular pet ,and show dog in England, and as Americans embraced Victorian customs, so too did they embrace the Yorkshire Terrier. The breed's popularity dipped in the 1940s, when the percentage of small breed dogs registered fell to an all-time low of 18% of total registrations. Smoky, a Yorkshire Terrier and famous war dog from World War II, is credited with beginning a renewal of interest in the breed. The American Kennel Club ranked the Yorkshire Terrier as the 6th most popular pure-breed in the United States of America in 2012 and 2013.\n\n\n== Coat ==\n\nFor adult Yorkshire Terriers, importance is placed on coat colour, quality and texture. The hair must be glossy, fine, straight and silky. Traditionally the coat is grown out very long and is parted down the middle of the back, but \"must never impede movement.\"From the back of the neck to the base of the tail, the coat should be a dark grey to a black colour, and the hair on the tail should be a darker black. On the head, high chest and legs, the hair should be a bright, rich tan, darker at the roots than in the middle, that shades into a lighter tan at the tips, but not for all dogs. Also, in adult dogs there should be no black hairs intermingled with any of the tan coloured fur.\nAdult Yorkshire Terriers that have other coat colours than the above, or that have woolly or extra fine coats, are still Yorkshire Terriers. The only difference is that atypical Yorkshire Terriers should not intentionally be bred. In addition, care may be more difficult for \"woolly\" or \"cottony\" textured coats, or coats that are overly fine. One of the reasons given for not breeding \"off-coloured\" Yorkies is that the colour could be a potential indicator of a genetic defect that may affect the dog's health, a careful health screening can clarify if any health risks exist. Coats may vary in colour. For example, a grown Yorkie may have a silver/blue with light brown while another might have a black and creamy colour.\nThe long coat on the Yorkshire Terrier means that the breed requires regular brushing.\n\n\n=== Hypoallergenic coats ===\n\nThe typical fine, straight and silky Yorkshire Terrier coat has also been listed by many popular dog information websites as being hypoallergenic. In comparison with many other breeds, Yorkies do not shed to the same degree, only losing small amounts when bathed or brushed. and it is the dog's dander and saliva that trigger most allergic reactions. Allergists do recognise that at times a particular allergy patient will be able to tolerate a particular dog, but they agree that \"the luck of the few with their pets cannot be stretched to fit all allergic people and entire breeds of dogs.\" The Yorkshire Terrier coat is said to fall out only when brushed or broken, or just said to not shed. Although neither of those statements agree with what biologists, veterinarians and allergists know about dog fur, allergists \"think there really are differences in protein production between dogs that may help one patient and not another\".\n\n\n=== Other colour ===\n\nThe Yorkshire Terrier is a tan dog with a blue saddle. Particolours exist, although they are not correct for the breed standard. The particolour coat is white with black/blue and tan. The white is caused by the recessive Piebald-gene. It is very rare to get a particolour, and if one is found, it tends to be very expensive. Some Yorkshire Terriers are solid golden, they only produce pheomelanin, others are liver or chocolate, a brown colour; they only produce brown eumelanin but are unable to produce black eumelanin. The breed is defined by its colour, and such non-standard colours may indicate health problems or cross-breeding with other breeds of other colours. The AKC registration form for Yorkshire Terriers allows for four choices: blue and tan, blue and gold, black and tan, black and gold. Colour alone will not affect whether or not a dog is a good companion and pet. Even though off-coloured Yorkshire Terriers are advertised at premium prices, being of an unusual or atypical colour is stated to be neither new, desirable, nor exotic.Until recently, mismatched Yorkshire Terriers could be crossed with Biewer Terriers, a new breed originated in Germany from particoloured Yorkshire Terriers. Although the American Kennel Club will not deny registration of a Yorkshire Terrier on colour alone, meaning that particolours are now registerable with the AKC, the Yorkshire Terrier Club of America has a directive that \"any solid colour or combination of colours other than black and tan\" for adult dogs is a disqualification, and \"dogs of solid colour, unusual combination of colours, and particolours should be disqualified.\"\n\n\n=== Puppy coats ===\n\nIt may take three or more years for the coat to reach its final colour. The final colour is usually a black or greyish colour. P. H. Combs, writing in 1891, complained about show wins awarded to puppies, when the dog's coat does not fully come in until three or four years old, \"and the honor of winning such a prize (for a puppy) can therefore be of but little practical benefit to the owner\" since the adult dog's colour cannot be exactly predicted.\n\n\n=== Coat care ===\nOwners may trim the hair short for easier care. For shows, the coat is left long, and may be trimmed to floor length to give ease of movement and a neater appearance. Hair on the feet and the tips of ears can also be trimmed. The traditional long coat is extremely high maintenance. The coat might get knotted if not brushed daily. In order to prevent breakage, the coat may be wrapped in rice paper, tissue paper or plastic, after a light oiling with a coat oil. The oil has to be washed out once a month and the wraps must be fixed periodically during the week to prevent them from sliding down and breaking the hair. Elaborate coat care dates from the earliest days of the breed. In 1878, John Walsh described similar preparations: the coat is \"well greased\" with coconut oil, the dog is bathed weekly, and the dog's feet are \"carefully kept in stockings\".\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe ideal Yorkshire Terrier character or \"personality\" is described with a \"carriage very upright feisty\" and \"conveying an important air\". Though small, the Yorkshire Terrier is active, very overprotective, curious and fond of attention.  Mentally sound and emotionally secure ones should normally not show the soft submissive temperament seen in lap dogs although many exhibit this behaviour due to improper training.  Because of this, it is advised that a Yorkie would not be suitable for a home with typical young children. Instead, they make ideal companions for older families with many more reputable breeders routinely only homing to families with children older than about 10 years for the comfort of the dog, but more so for the benefit of the child.Yorkshire Terriers are an easy dog breed to train. This results from their own nature to work without human assistance. They are naturally smart and quick to learn with many being food and or praise motivated.  Because they were developed as a working breed many need a lot of both physical and mental stimulation\u2014with both long walks/runs but also indoor games and training to keep their mind busy. They are known for being yappy, but many have reported that a contented Yorkie is a quiet one\u2014that will happily curl up on your knee in the evening. However, they are all individuals, with some being much more laid back than others and the breeder should ideally be able to advise on the needs and temperaments of their particular line. Yorkies are easily adaptable to all surroundings, travel well and make suitable pets for many homes. Due to their small size, they require limited exercise but need daily interaction with people. They thrive on attention and love. Many however are more timid around other dogs and prefer to stay close to their humans for comfort.Yorkshire Terriers do tend to bark a lot. This makes them excellent watchdogs as they will sound the alarm when anyone gets close. However, this barking problem can be resolved with proper training and exercise.\nYorkshire Terriers are ranked 34th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs.\n\n\n== Health ==\nHealth issues often seen in the Yorkshire Terrier include bronchitis, lymphangiectasia, portosystemic shunt, cataracts and keratitis sicca. Additionally, Yorkies often have a delicate digestive system, with vomiting or diarrhoea resulting from consumption of foods outside of a regular diet. The relatively small size of the Yorkshire Terrier means that it usually has a poor tolerance for anaesthesia. Additionally, a toy dog such as the Yorkie is more likely to be injured by falls, other dogs and owner clumsiness. Injection reactions (inflammation or hair loss at the site of an injection) can occur. In addition allergies can cause skin to be dry, itchy and/or red.The life span of a Yorkie is 13\u201320 years. Undersized Yorkies (under 3 lb [1.4 kg]) generally have a shorter life span, as they are especially prone to health problems such as chronic diarrhoea and vomiting; are even more sensitive to anaesthesia; and are more easily injured.\n\n\n=== Teeth ===\n\nAs with all other dogs, Yorkies have two sets of teeth in their life. The first set of teeth is the 28-piece deciduous teeth (often referred to as \"milk teeth\", \"baby teeth\" or \"puppy teeth\"). The second set is the 42-piece permanent or adult teeth. Sometimes the number of permanent or adult teeth may vary, which is fine as long as they do not cause bad bite. When puppies are born, they have no teeth because milk is the only food they need. The deciduous teeth will grow from the age of 3 to 8 weeks old, in the order of incisors, canine/ fangs and premolars. Yorkie puppies have no molar teeth. Yorkie puppies will start to lose their deciduous or baby teeth when the permanent or adult teeth come in. The permanent or adult grow when the Yorkie puppies are 4 to 8 months old. By around 8 months old, those teeth should fully develop. The permanent or adult teeth will grow in the order of incisors, canine/fangs, premolars and molars. Molar teeth will develop at around 6 to 8 months old.Yorkies and other small dog breeds may have problems if the deciduous or baby teeth do not fall out as the permanent or adult teeth grow. This is caused by the new teeth not growing right underneath the deciduous teeth. (Usually, a puppy\u2019s body will absorb the roots of puppy teeth.) If the puppy tooth does not yield to the incoming tooth, it should be removed because it can cause a malocclusion or bad bite.  Retained teeth can cause tooth decay because food can be easily caught in between the deciduous and permanent teeth. Sometimes the new teeth are forced to grow into an abnormal position and further cause a bad bite. The retained teeth may stay or fall weeks after the new teeth have developed. When necessary, the retained deciduous or baby teeth need to be removed surgically.\n\nLike other small breeds, Yorkies are also prone to severe dental disease. Because they have a small jaw, their teeth can become crowded and may not fall out naturally. This can cause food and plaque to build up, and bacteria can eventually develop on the surface of the teeth, leading to periodontal disease. In addition, the bacteria can spread to other parts of the body and cause heart and kidney problems. The best prevention is regular brushing of the teeth with a toothpaste formulated specifically for dogs. Human toothpaste is not recommended, because it foams more easily and may be swallowed. Professional teeth cleaning by a veterinarian may also be required to prevent the development of dental problems.\n\n\n=== Genetic defects ===\nCertain genetic disorders can be found in Yorkshire Terriers, including distichiasis, hydrocephalus, hypoplasia of dens, Legg\u2013Calv\u00e9\u2013Perthes syndrome, luxating patella, portosystemic shunt, retinal dysplasia, tracheal collapse and bladder stones.  The following are among the most common congenital defects that affect Yorkie's.\n\nDistichiae, eyelashes arising from an abnormal spot (usually the duct of the meibomian gland at the edge of the eyelid), are often found in Yorkies.  Distichiae can irritate the eye and cause tearing, squinting, inflammation,  corneal abrasions or corneal ulcers, and scarring. Treatment options may include manual removal, electrolysis or surgery.\nHypoplasia of dens is a non-formation of the pivot point of the second cervical vertebra, which leads to spinal cord damage.  Onset of the condition may occur at any age, producing signs ranging from neck pain to quadriplegia.\nLegg\u2013Calv\u00e9\u2013Perthes syndrome, which causes the top of the femur (thigh bone) to degenerate, occurs in Yorkies in certain lines.  The condition appears to result from insufficient circulation to the area around the hip joint. As the blood supply is reduced, the bone in the head of the femur collapses and dies and the cartilage coating around it becomes cracked and deformed.  Usually the disease appears when the Yorkie is young (between five and eight months of age); signs are pain, limping or lameness.  The standard treatment is surgery to remove the affected part of the bone.  Following surgery, muscles hold the femur in place and fibrous tissue forms in the area of removal to prevent bone rubbing on bone.  Although the affected leg will be slightly shorter than prior to surgery, the Yorkie may regain almost normal use.\nLuxating patellas (slipping kneecaps) are another common defect considered to be genetic in Yorkies, although it may also be caused by an accidental fall. Weak ligaments and tendons in the knee or malformed (too shallow) patellar grooves, allow the patella to slip out of its groove sideways.  This causes the leg to 'lock up' with the foot held off the ground.  A dog with this problem may experience frequent pain and lameness or may be bothered by it only on occasion. Over time, the patellar ridges can become worn down, making the groove even more shallow and causing the dog to become increasingly lame.  Surgery is the main treatment option available for luxating patellas, although it is not necessary for every dog with the condition. The severity of luxating patellas are on a scale of 1 to 4, with 4 being the most severe.  Many dogs will not develop past a stage 1 or 2.\nPortosystemic shunt, a congenital malformation of the portal vein (which brings blood to the liver for cleansing), is also common in Yorkies. In this condition some of the dog's blood bypasses the liver and the \"dirty\" blood goes on to poison the heart, brain, lungs and other organs with toxins. A Yorkie with this condition might exhibit a wide variety of symptoms, such as small stature, poor appetite, weak muscle development, decreased ability to learn, inferior coordination, occasional vomiting and diarrhoea, behavioral abnormalities, seizures (especially after a meal) and blindness, which could lead to a coma and death. Often, the shunt can be treated with surgery.\n Tracheal collapse, caused by a progressive weakening of the walls of the trachea, occurs in many toy breeds, especially very tiny Yorkies.  As a result of genetics, the walls of the trachea can be flaccid, a condition that becomes more severe with age. Cushing's syndrome, a disorder that causes production of excess steroid hormone by the adrenal glands, can also weaken cartilage and lead to tracheal collapse.  There is a possibility that physical strain on the neck might cause or contribute to trachea collapse. Since this is usually caused by an energetic Yorkie pulling against his collar, many veterinarians recommend use of a harness for leashed walks.  An occasional \"goose honking\" cough, especially on exertion or excitement, is usually the first sign of this condition.  Over time, the cough may become almost constant in the Yorkie's later life. Breathing through the obstruction of a collapsed (or partially collapsed) trachea for many years can result in complications, including chronic lung disease. The coughing can be countered with cough suppressants and bronchodilators.  If the collapse is advanced and unresponsive to medication, sometimes surgery can repair the trachea.\n\n\n=== Hypoglycaemia ===\nLow blood sugar in puppies, or transient juvenile hypoglycaemia, is caused by fasting (too much time between meals).  In rare cases hypoglycaemia may continue to be a problem in mature, usually very small, Yorkies. It is often seen in Yorkie puppies at 5 to 16 weeks of age.  Very tiny Yorkie puppies are especially predisposed to hypoglycaemia because a lack of muscle mass makes it difficult to store glucose and regulate blood sugar.  Factors such as stress, fatigue, a cold environment, poor nutrition, and a change in diet or feeding schedule may bring on hypoglycaemia.  Low blood sugar can also be the result of a bacterial infection, parasite or portosystemic liver shunt.  Hypoglycaemia causes the puppy to become drowsy, listless (glassy-eyed), shaky, uncoordinated, since the brain relies on sugar to function. During a hypoglycaemic attack, the puppy usually has very pale or grey gums. The puppy also may not eat unless force-fed.  Hypoglycaemia and dehydration seem to go hand-in-hand, and force-feeding or injecting fluids may also be necessary. Additionally, a hypoglycaemic Yorkie may have a lower than normal body temperature and, in extreme cases, may have a seizure or go into a coma. A dog showing symptoms should be given sugar in the form of corn syrup or Nutri-Cal and be treated by a veterinarian immediately, as prolonged or recurring attacks of hypoglycaemia can permanently damage the dog's brain.  In severe cases it can be fatal.\n\n\n=== Docking ===\n\nTraditionally, the Yorkshire Terrier's tail is docked to a medium length.   Opposition to this practice began very early in the history of the breed; Hugh Dalziel, writing about Yorkshire Terriers in 1878, declared that \"There is no reason for mutilating pet dogs, and perfect ears and tails should be bred, not clipped into shape with scissors.\" American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel club still require the Yorkie\u2019s tail be docked in order to compete at its events. The majority of the rest of the world has adopted a \"no docking/no cropping\" rule. Often, a Yorkshire Terrier's dewclaws, if any, are removed in the first few days of life, another controversial practice.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Similar breeds and crosses ==\nThe Yorkshire Terrier breed descends from larger but similar Scottish breeds such as the now extinct Paisley Terrier and the Skye Terrier. In its turn, other breeds have been created from the Yorkshire Terrier, such as the Australian Silky Terrier. Demand for unusual pets has resulted in high prices being paid for Yorkshire Terriers crossed with various other breeds, which are described with a portmanteau word made up of syllables (or sounds) from Yorkshire Terrier and the breed name of the other parent. Some of these such portmanteau-named crosses can be found on the List of dog crossbreeds page.\nTwo other breeds that look similar to the Yorkshire Terrier and have shorter hair are the prick-eared Norwich Terrier, along with its drop-eared relative the Norfolk Terrier. Another is the Biewer Terrier, which derives from the Yorkshire Terrier. The Biewer Terrier, bred from a blue, white and gold puppy later named Schneeflocken von Friedheck and owned by Mr. and Mrs. Biewer of Germany, was once considered a variation of the Yorkshire Terrier but has since been recognised as a separate breed by many kennel clubs, including the American Kennel Club (AKC).\n\n\n== \"Teacup Yorkies\" ==\n\n\"Teacup\" Yorkshire terriers is a term used to describe very small Yorkshire terriers. The American Kennel Club and other kennel clubs do not acknowledge the Teacup as a variation of the breed or recognise it as a separate variety.\nUsually a teacup is any dog weighing less than 4 lb (1.8 kg) when fully grown, when the actual breed standard is given at 7 lb (3.2 kg) maximum. Breeding for \"Teacup\" size is a controversial practice that is not encouraged by responsible breeders.They are bred to appeal with their puppy-like features, rather than bred to avoid health issues.
